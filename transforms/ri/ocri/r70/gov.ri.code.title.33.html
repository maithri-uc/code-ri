        Where grandchildren alleged tortious interference with their expectancy of inheritance, their claims failed to survive summary judgment because they did not exhaust their statutory remedies; Rhode Island’s statutory procedure would have provided an adequate remedy: (1) as legatees under their grandmother’s will, as well as intestate heirs, the grandchildren qualified as persons “legally interested” in the estate; and (2) the grandchildren could have made a written request to the executor or the administrator of the estate to bring an action to recover the property.

        Apportionment of attorneys’ fees and expenses of administration between a life tenant and a remainderman was error because the life estate was taken subject only to any encumbrance or secured lien on the property that existed at time of the decedent’s death, and the apportioned costs were not encumbrances or liens; these expenses, including legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses, were separate and apart from the closing costs associated with the sale of the real estate at issue, which properly were allocated. The fees and expenses incurred during the administration of the probate estate did not exist at the time of the decedent’s death and should have been paid from the remainder interest. Jerome v.

If it is not established by clear and convincing evidence that an individual, who would otherwise be an heir, survived the decedent by one hundred twenty (120) hours, it is considered that the individual failed to survive for the required period. This section is not to be applied if its application would result in escheat of intestate estate to the state.

        The Slayer’s Act (this chapter) was intended to exclude a slayer from acquiring any property that was formerly held by a slain decedent; the act does not address property or benefits received by the slayer from other sources, nor should the act be construed to apply to individuals who have no right to acquire property through the decedent.

        The phrase “otherwise destroying” imports a destruction of both the substance and contents of the will, and anything short of a destruction of this degree is entirely ineffectual as a revocation, particularly where the original writing remains legible. Estate of Eglee,

        Execution of codicil which merely republished will did not revive residuary bequest which had been adeemed by an advancement subsequent to execution of will but prior to date of codicil. Hayes v. Welling,
        <cite class="ocri">

        An “in specie” test for determining whether a specific legacy has been adeemed first determines whether the gift is a specific legacy and then establishes whether the legacy is in the estate at the time of the testator’s death. Whereas a nominal or formal change of the gift does not bring about ademption, a substantial change does. Pike v. Pike,

       </p>
       <p>
        There is no ademption of the legacy where the legacy is contained in a joint bank account between the testator and the legatee even though the legatee has committed conversion. The change in the gift through the conversion is a mere change of hands and is nominal in nature. Pike v. Pike,

        Where a will provides a life estate, with remainder to blood children of the life tenant reaching the age of 21 or, failing the survival, remainder over to a named contingent remainderman, the rule in Shelley’s Case does not apply and life tenant takes an equitable estate for life only, while the remainder over amounts to an interest in fee by way of executory devise contingent upon the first named remaindermen reaching age 21.

       Interest on general pecuniary legacies.

     <p>
      Unless otherwise provided in the will, a general pecuniary legatee shall not be entitled to interest on his or her legacy for the period of one year from and after the death of the testator. After the one year period the executor or administrator with the will annexed, unless otherwise provided by the testator, shall not be chargeable for more interest on any pecuniary legacy than the entire net income actually earned by the legacy if and when left in the investment as made by the testator, or actually invested in notes secured by mortgage upon real estate situated in this state, or in the bonds of any city or town in this state, or deposited in any savings bank in this state, or in the participation account of any trust company in this state, or invested in any other manner specially ordered by the probate court. But if otherwise invested, the legacy shall bear interest at the rate of six percent (6%) per annum or such larger rate as the same may have earned; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall authorize executors or administrators to make investments other than trustees are allowed to make, unless specially authorized by the will to do so.

The term “will”, as used in this section, shall be deemed to include the testator’s will and all codicils thereto effective at the testator’s death; and the term “the execution of his or her will” shall be deemed, in a case in which there is a codicil or codicils, to refer to the execution of the latest codicil effective at the testator’s death.

        The provision for an after-born child established a rule of law without regard to the will or the intent of the testator, so that evidence of intent not to provide for such child was inadmissible. Chace v. Chace,

       <p>
        An after-born child is entitled to an intestate share when under the provisions of his father’s will he would take a portion of the estate only if his sister died unmarried before she was twenty years old, since such a provision is too contingent to satisfy the policy of the statute.

      A devise, bequest, or appointment in a will validly executed under the provisions of this chapter may be made in form or substance to the trustee or trustees of a trust in writing executed by the testator or any other person or persons prior to and in existence at the time of the execution of the will, and identified in the will, whatever the size or character of the corpus of the trust (including an unfounded life insurance trust, although the settlor has reserved any or all rights of ownership in the insurance policies). A devise, bequest, or appointment shall not be invalid because the trust is amendable or revocable, or both, by the settlor or any other person or persons; nor because the trust instrument or any amendment thereto was not executed in the manner required for wills; nor because the trust was amended after the execution of the will. Unless the will provides otherwise, the property so devised, bequeathed or appointed shall not be deemed held under a testamentary trust, but shall become and be a part of the principal of the trust to which it is given to be administered and disposed of in accordance with the terms and provisions of the trust to which it is given, including any amendments, as it appears in writing at the death of the testator. In the event of complete termination of the trust prior to the testator’s death, the devise or bequest shall lapse and the appointment fail unless the will directs otherwise.

      Upon complaint under oath, made to a probate court, by a person claiming to be interested in the estate of a person deceased against any one suspected of retaining, concealing, or conspiring with others to retain or conceal a will or testamentary instrument of the deceased, the court may cite the suspected person to appear before it and be examined under oath about the complaint. Upon examination, all interrogatories and answers shall be in writing, signed by the party examined, and shall be filed in the court. If the person cited refuses to appear and submit to examination, or to answer the interrogatories that are lawfully propounded to him or her, or to obey any lawful order of the court, he or she may be adjudged to be in contempt and may be committed to the adult correctional institutions, there to remain until he or she submits to the order of court. On the complaint, the court may, in its discretion, award costs to be paid by either party, and may issue execution therefor.

The foregoing provision shall not preclude the court, in its discretion, from requiring in addition, the testimony in person, or by deposition, of any available subscribing witness, or proof of such other important facts and circumstances as the court may deem necessary to admit the will to probate.

      A person interested in a will which is operative without probate by the laws of the state or country where the testator had his or her domicile at the time of his or her death may produce to the probate court of any town in this state in which there is any property, real or personal, on which the will may operate, a copy of the will and of the official record, duly authenticated according to act of congress, and the court shall assign a time and place for a hearing and cause notice to be given as in the case of a will offered for probate. If at such hearing the court finds, from the copies before it and any additional proof as to the authenticity and execution of the will, that the instrument ought to be allowed in this state as the last will of the deceased, it shall order the copy to be filed and recorded, and the will shall then have the same effect as if it had been originally proved and allowed in this state.

      The probate court in which an original will has been duly proved, allowed, and recorded may, after the expiration of the time within which an appeal may be taken from the decree admitting the will to probate, upon the petition of the executor, or of a legatee named in the will, or of any person interested in the estate of the testator, and after any notice the court may require and a hearing thereon, permit the original will, if it appears to be necessary for the purpose, to be taken from the files of the court and to be used in another state, territory, district or foreign country, for the purpose of establishing the right or title of the executor, legatee or person to the estate of the testator in the other state, territory, district or foreign country, upon the terms and conditions as the court may prescribe. Likewise, before probate, an instrument purporting to be a last will may be annexed to a commission for taking depositions in proof of the same, in this or any other state, territory, district or foreign country; a photographic copy of the instrument, duly certified, being retained on the files of the court. From any order of the court granting permission, for annexing a will to a commission as provided above, no appeal shall lie. In case the original will is lost, on proof of loss, the copy may be proved in the same manner and shall have the same effect as the original.

        Where executrix and sole legatee of husband’s estate never withdrew bank deposit belonging to the husband, the probate court abused its judicial discretion in appointing as administrator with the will annexed the next of kin of deceased husband, instead of the executor and residuary legatee of the deceased executrix, since next of kin of deceased husband had no interest in the money.

       <p>
        This section gives no priority or preference to the next of kin; since the right to administration follows the property, therefore, the appointment of a next of kin without property rights in the estate was unsuitable. Hennessey v. Meehan,

        The administrator de bonis non with the will annexed had the power to sell real estate for the payment of debts, since he succeeded to the power of the executrix under a will provision which, in the same clause, appointed testator’s wife as executrix and authorized her to sell any of the real estate.

        This section puts a duty on a probate court to determine the amount and to whom payments should be made for the upkeep of a cemetery lot where the estate is solvent. Therefore, the probate court cannot simply deny a petition for such payment. Hall v. Burgess,

        Under the provisions of this section, an administrator or executor may pay to a church so much of an invalid trust as may be determined by the probate court to be necessary to provide perpetual care for a grave from the income from such funds. Todd v. St. Mary's Church,

        Where the intention of a testatrix to have flowers placed on her grave for an indefinite length of time cannot be carried out because it is contrary to the rule against perpetuities, the executor under his discretion ought to procure perpetual care for her burial lot under this section.

      Whenever it shall for any reason appear to be desirable for an executor or administrator to borrow money, the superior court, upon bill or petition in equity filed by the executor or administrator, may authorize the executor or administrator to borrow, for any one or more of the purposes specified in § 33-9-15, such sum or sums, for such period or periods of time, and upon such terms and conditions as the court shall deem advisable, and the court may authorize the executor or administrator to mortgage, pledge, or otherwise subject to lien, as security for the repayment of the money borrowed, the whole or any part or parts of the personal estate in his hands; provided, however, that property specifically bequeathed shall not be mortgaged, pledged, or otherwise subjected to lien so long as there remains personal property not specifically bequeathed which may be so mortgaged, pledged, or otherwise subjected to lien. For the purpose of exercising any powers so granted, an executor or administrator may execute such promissory notes, bonds, mortgages, deeds of trust or other instruments, containing such powers of sale, conditions, covenants or other provisions, as may be necessary or proper in the circumstances. In granting this authority, the court may impose such conditions or restrictions and give such directions as it may deem advisable; and the court may either direct that particular property may be so mortgaged or pledged, or may authorize the executor or administrator to mortgage or pledge the whole or such part or parts of the personal estate in his or her hands as he or she may in his or her discretion deem advisable, subject, however, to the provisions in regard to property specifically bequeathed.

     <p>
      When a person dies holding the legal title to property, real or personal, and an action for specific performance of contract for sale thereof would have existed as against the deceased had he or she lived, a complaint against the executor or administrator alone of the deceased may be brought by the person with whom the deceased has made the contract, setting out the facts, the pendency of which bill shall be advertised at least twice each week for three (3) successive weeks in some newspaper published in the city of Providence, which notice shall be in addition to legal notice to the executor or administrator. And on hearing the cause, if it appear that a proper case has been made out, the superior court shall decree that a conveyance shall be made by a master to be appointed for that purpose whose deed shall vest the title of the deceased in the party entitled to specific performance on payment of the purchase price, which, less the costs of the suit, including costs as between solicitor and client, shall be personal assets in the hands of the executor or administrator.

        Where all of the debts of the estate were paid with the exception of plaintiff ’s claim, disappearance of assets of estate was unexplained, and the executrix filed no inventory or representation of insolvency for several years, the trial court probably granted an execution against the personal estate of the executrix in order to satisfy judgment against her in her capacity as executrix.

       Allowances for temporary support of family.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The probate court shall make reasonable allowance out of the decedent’s probate estate for the support of his or her family, until the support can otherwise be provided for, for a period not exceeding six (6) months from the date of the death, having regard to the situation of the family and the value and circumstances of the estate. The allowance may be fixed at any time upon application of the personal representative, or of any party in interest, filed within six (6) months after the first publication of notice of the qualification of the personal representative. The court may, in its discretion, provided a final account has not been allowed, make an additional allowance under like conditions for the support of the family for a second period not exceeding six (6) months, the allowance to be fixed at any time after the first six-month (6) period has passed and within one year after the first publication of notice of the qualification of the personal representative upon application, of the personal representative or of any party in interest. After exhausting the personal property, real estate may be sold to provide the amount of allowance decreed in the same manner as for the payment of debts. An appeal from a decree granting letters testamentary or of administration shall not prevent the allowance being made by the probate court or the payment thereof. An appeal from a decree making any allowance shall not prevent the payment of the allowance if a bond in such amount as may be fixed by the court, but no less than the amount of the allowance be given to the court by a surviving spouse, if any, or by a guardian of the minor children in case there be no surviving spouse, with surety or sureties approved by the court, and conditioned to repay all in excess of what is finally determined to be a reasonable allowance or to return all of the allowance in case the decree granting the allowance is finally reversed in the full amount. The bond required by the provisions of this section and the remedies thereon shall be governed by the provisions of chapter 17 of this title as far as the context thereof permits.

        By use of the words “until the same can otherwise be provided for,” the general assembly intended to limit the granting of allowances to widows to cases where there was no other adequate provision for support. Rhode Island Hosp. Trust Co. v. Hopkins,

        Jury instruction that “the statute says an allowance shall be made and it is obvious that there is a tremendously wide discretion allowed to the court” was misleading in probate appeal of family allowance where the court failed to instruct on the effect of the restrictive words, “until the same can otherwise be provided for.” Rhode Island Hosp.

        Where administrator de bonis non was appointed after February 1, 1896, but original administrator was appointed and qualified before such date, claims against estate were governed by the special statute of limitations under prior law, as a new administration is merely a continuation of the preceding one.

       Manner of presentation of claims.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Claims against a decedent’s estate may be presented as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t33c11s33-11-4ol11">
       The claimant shall present a written statement of the claim with the clerk of the probate court indicating its basis, the amount claimed (if known), the name and address of the claimant, and the name and address of the claimant’s attorney (if any) and deliver or mail a copy thereof to the personal representative. The claim is deemed presented when filed with the probate court. The claimant has the burden of establishing proper and timely presentation of the claim. If the claim is not yet due, the date when it will become due shall be stated. If the claim is contingent or unliquidated, the nature of the condition or uncertainty shall be stated. If the claim is secured, the security shall be described. Failure to accurately describe the due date of claim not yet due, the nature of any condition or uncertainty, or the security, does not invalidate the presentation made.
      </li>
      <li id="t33c11s33-11-4ol12">
       No presentation of claim is required for matters already claimed in proceedings which were pending against the decedent at the time of his or her death. No personal representative shall be held to defend and no decedent’s estate shall be held liable for any claim pending against the decedent until the estate shall be joined as a party with notice to the probate court and the personal representative served.

        The trial justice did not err in determining that the provision requiring claims filed against the estates of deceased persons to contain an affidavit was not jurisdictional in character, as the primary purpose was to require a copy of the claim to be placed in the hands of the executor or administrator simultaneously with or prior to the filing of the claim in the probate court; therefore, claim of divorced wife filed against the estate of her former husband was not defective for lack of an affidavit.

        The Probate Court is given a wide, although not unlimited, discretion in the matter of filing claims against estate which are out of time, and unless the Probate Court has abused that discretion, its decision will not be reversed and its judgment on the facts after a fair hearing will stand as conclusive, unless such judgment is so lacking in evidence to support it, that there is no valid reason for the exercise of the court’s discretion.

        Probate court erred in granting a claimant’s petition for leave to file a claim out of time against an estate because the probate court was without jurisdiction to entertain the petition as it was presented for filing after the final distribution had been paid or delivered to the estate’s beneficiaries, although the distribution was made without a prior order of the probate court. The fact that the executor of the estate did not secure a release regarding another claim against the estate before distributing the assets did not alter the analysis. In re Estate of Buonanno,

      The decision of the probate court as to depositing assets or giving bond upon the contingent claim of a creditor shall not be conclusive as to the validity of the claim against the personal representative or other party interested to oppose the allowance thereof; and the personal representative shall not be compelled to pay the claim, unless it is proved to be due in an action commenced by the claimant within one year after its claim becomes payable. In case of suit against the personal representative, recovery shall be limited to the assets in the registry of the court deposited as provided in § 33-11-9.

If no such request is timely made or if the probate court in its sole discretion finds that pleading, discovery and trial of the issues presented would be more efficiently presented in the district or superior court depending upon the amount in controversy, the disallowance shall be affirmed by order of the probate court and the claimant shall bring civil action on the disallowed claim pursuant to § 33-11-48 within thirty (30) days of the entry thereof or said claim shall be forever barred.

        The trial court did not err in finding that a challenge to the denial of a probate claim was not timely filed since the claimant took no further action after the denial of his claim until more than five months after the statute of limitations had run. Heflin v. Koszela,

        Allegation that executor failed to file statement in probate court either allowing or denying claim as required by former statute was proper, even if not necessary, as the presumption would be that he had acted as the law required and had duly rejected such claim. Slocom v. Wilbour,

        Where claimant failed to file writ against the administrator, allegedly because of the failure of claimant’s attorney to file and belief that he had a sufficient remedy in the probate court, superior court could refuse to enter papers as of that date. National Casket Co. v. Montgomery,

        Bringing suit on disallowed claim in strict compliance with this section after executrix had appealed from probate decree granting leave to file such claim out of time, was a purely procedural step not requiring immediate determination by the court. McLaughlin v. Dunlop,

        Although recovery for a tortious injury allegedly committed by a person who later dies may be uncertain, at the time of the person’s death the claim already has accrued and is not dependent upon some future event, and thus a person filing a negligence claim, like every other creditor, is required to file his probate court claim pursuant to § 33-11-5 and any subsequent action challenging the denial of that probate claim pursuant to § 33-11-48.

        When a bankruptcy debtor’s mother generally devised certain real property to the debtor, in common with the debtor’s sister, in the residuary clause of the mother’s will, the debtor had no standing to occupy or intend to occupy the property, after the sister, acting as executrix of the mother’s estate, began proceedings to evict the debtor from the property, because (1) the sister did not require the consent of the debtor or of the court to sell the property, as R.I. Gen. Laws § 33-12-6 did not require the debtor’s consent for generally devised property, and the will gave the sister the authority to sell the property, and (2) the sister took affirmative steps to sell the property before the debtor filed for bankruptcy protection, divesting the debtor of the debtor’s possessory interest in the property.

      After the expiration of the time for claiming an appeal from the decree on the report of the commissioners on an insolvent estate, the probate court shall make a decree for the distribution of the estate among the creditors whose claims are allowed. If an appeal is claimed or if a suit is pending against the estate, the decree may be suspended until the determination of the appeal or suit, or a distribution may be ordered among the creditors whose claims are allowed, leaving in the hands of the executor or administrator an amount sufficient to pay claimants whose appeals or suits are pending a proportion equal to that of the other creditors. In case further assets shall come to the hands of the executor or administrator after the decree of distribution, the probate court shall make from time to time further decrees of distribution among the creditors.

But, if by the will of the deceased any part of his or her estate, or any one or more of the devisees or legatees, is made exclusively liable for the claim in exoneration of the residue of the estate or of other devisees or legatees, those provisions of the will shall be complied with and the persons and estates so exempted shall be liable for only so much of the claims as cannot be recovered from those who are first chargeable therewith.

       Legislative intent.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislature finds that adjudicating a person totally incapacitated and in need of a guardian deprives that person of all his or her civil and legal rights and that this deprivation may be unnecessary. The legislature further finds that it is desirable to make available, the least restrictive form of guardianship to assist persons who are only partially incapable of caring for their needs. Recognizing that every individual has unique needs and differing abilities, the legislature declares that it is the purpose of this act to promote the public welfare by establishing a system that permits incapacitated persons to participate as fully as possible in all decisions affecting them; that assists such persons in meeting the essential requirements for their physical health and safety, in protecting their rights, in managing their financial resources, and developing or regaining their abilities to the maximum extent possible; and that accomplishes these objectives through providing, in each case, the form of assistance that least interferes with the legal capacity of a person to act in his or her own behalf. This chapter shall be liberally construed to accomplish this purpose.

         Absent a finding, based on a decision making assessment tool, that an individual is totally incapacitated, the court shall limit the scope of the powers and duties of a guardian to the terms best suited to allow the individual found partially incapacitated to participate as fully as possible in decisions affecting him or her. One such decision making assessment tool must be completed by the respondent’s primary care physician, if one exists and is available, otherwise by a physician who has examined and treated the respondent. The probate court may consider such additional decision making assessments tools signed and submitted by one or more non-physicians or consulting physicians. The court shall not appoint a guardian or limited guardian if the court finds that the needs of the proposed ward are being met or can be met by a less restrictive alternative or alternatives. The court shall authorize the guardian to make decisions for the individual in only those areas where the court finds, based on one or more decision making assessment tools, that the individual lacks the capacity to make decisions. The court must strike a delicate balance between providing the protection and support necessary to assist the individual and preserving, to the largest degree possible, the liberty, property and privacy interests of the individual. The certificate of appointment issued to the limited guardian shall clearly state that it is a limited guardianship. The court order shall clearly indicate the scope of the powers and duties of the limited guardian. The appointment of a limited guardian shall not constitute a finding of legal incompetence. An individual for whom a limited guardian is appointed shall retain all legal and civil rights except those which have been specifically suspended by the order.

         A decision-making assessment tool, in the form as shown in § 33-15-47, must be filed with the petition in each case, provided, that the probate court may excuse the filing of a decision-making assessment tool only on a petition for temporary guardianship in extraordinary or emergency circumstances and upon the provision of other competent evidence.

        <li id="t33c15s33-15-4ol1a3">
         The individual’s primary care physician must complete the decision-making assessment tool, however, if the individual’s primary care physician is not available or if the individual does not have a primary care physician the decision-making assessment tool must be completed by a physician who has examined and treated the individual. Professionals, or other persons acquainted with the individual being assessed, may also complete additional decision-making assessment tools.

        <li id="t33c15s33-15-4ol1a4">
         Modification.  If, because of a change in the partially incapacitated individual’s level of decision making ability, the scope and duties of the limited guardianship order no longer meet the needs of the individual and/or fail to afford the individual as much autonomy as possible, modification of the limited guardianship order is required.
         <ol type="i">
          <li id="t33c15s33-15-4ol1a4-i">
           Modification can be accomplished by agreement of: the partially incapacitated individual, his or her counsel, if any and the limited guardian. This agreement shall be submitted to the court and entered as an order.

       <p>
        Superior court properly dismissed the probate appeal of the 93-year-old ward as the ward was under a full guardianship and thus lacked the capacity to retain independent counsel to pursue the probate appeal on his own behalf. Although the petition filed by the ward’s children was titled “petition for limited guardianship”, the certificate of appointment did not comply with this section because it did not clearly state that the guardian was appointed as limited guardian and it qualified the guardian as guardian of both the person and estate of the ward. Further, the December 15, 2015 order was defective because it did not clearly indicate the scope of the powers and duties of the limited guardian, and the December 18, 2015 order superseded the December 15, 2015 order.

      , the court may appoint a temporary limited guardian for the specific purpose of authorizing, directing, or ratifying any transaction necessary or desirable for admission to a nursing facility, including, but not limited to, enrolling the protected person in the medicaid or general public assistance programs, in those instances where the nursing facility requires a limited guardian and the admission is in the best interest of the protected person. Prior to appointing a temporary limited guardian pursuant to this section, the court shall first make the following findings of fact:

If a limited guardian or guardian is appointed with authority to administer the real property of the respondent, all contracts relative to, and sales and conveyances of, real property, made by the respondent after the record, and all other contracts, except for necessaries, and all gifts, sales, or transfers of personal property, made by the respondent after the first publication of notice of the petition and before the termination of the limited guardianship or guardianship, shall be void.

        Evidence of the neglect and misconduct of a guardian in the supervision of his ward and management of the estate subsequent to appointment does not show that he was not suitable at the time of appointment and therefore is inadmissible on appeal from appointment. The appropriate remedy is an action for removal for breach of duty under this section. Roullard v. McSoley,

        Trial court properly held a decedent’s will was valid because (1) a restriction imposed in a guardianship proceeding barring the decedent from engaging in estate planning was removed when a probate court dismissed the temporary limited guardianship upon finding the decedent capable of managing the decedent’s affairs, not when the decedent’s guardian was discharged upon filing a required accounting, and (2) the will was executed after the guardianship proceeding was dismissed.

        A guardian may properly maintain his ward in an asylum in the hope of benefit to the ward if the ward’s estate is of a sufficient amount. In such a situation, a claim against the ward’s estate for the expense incurred may be properly allowed, although the guardian has not made payment, since the guardian is personally liable for the expense.

       The superior or probate court, upon the petition of a conservator, limited guardian or guardian, other than the guardian of a minor, and after notice by publication as the court directs and other notice to all persons interested, may authorize the conservator, limited guardian or guardian to exercise any and all powers over the estate and business affairs of the ward which the ward could exercise if present and not under disability. The court may authorize the taking of such action, or the application of any funds as are not required for the ward’s own maintenance and support, in any fashion as the court shall approve as being in keeping with the ward’s wishes, so far as they can be ascertained, or which the conservator, guardian or limited guardian can demonstrate is in the best interest of the ward. In ascertaining and carrying out the ward’s wishes, or in determining which actions are in the ward’s best interests, the court may consider, but shall not be limited to minimization of current or prospective state or federal income, estate and inheritance taxes, and providing for gifts to charities, relatives and friends as would be likely recipients of donations or future inheritances from the ward.
      </li>
      <li id="t33c15s33-15-37.1ol1b">
       This action or application of funds may include, but shall not be limited to, the making of gifts, to the conveyance or release of the ward’s contingent and expectant interests in property including marital property rights, and any right of survivorship incident to joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety, to the exercise or release of the ward’s powers as donee of a power of appointment, the making of contracts, the creation of revocable or irrevocable trusts of property of the ward’s estate which may extend beyond the ward’s disability or life and for which the ward may or may not be a beneficiary, the exercise of options of the ward to purchase securities or other property, the exercise of the ward’s right to elect options and to change beneficiaries under insurance and annuity policies, and the surrendering of policies for their cash value, the exercise of the ward’s right to an elective share in the estate of the ward’s deceased spouse, and the renunciation or disclaimer of any interest acquired by testate or intestate succession or by inter vivos transfer.
      </li>
      <li id="t33c15s33-15-37.1ol1c">
       The guardian, limited guardian or conservator in the petition shall briefly outline the action or application of funds for which approval is sought, the results expected to be accomplished thereby and the tax savings, if any, expected to accrue. The proposed action or application of funds may include gifts of the ward’s personal property or real estate. Gifts may be for the benefit of prospective legatees, devisees or heirs apparent of the ward, or may be made to individuals or charities in which the ward is believed to have an interest. The conservator, limited guardian or guardian shall also indicate in the petition that any planned disposition is consistent with the intentions of the ward insofar as they can be ascertained, or are otherwise in the best interest of the ward. If the ward’s intentions cannot be ascertained, the ward will be presumed to favor reduction in the incidence of the various forms of taxation, and the partial distribution of the ward’s estate during his or her lifetime, as provided in this section. The conservator, limited guardian or guardian shall not, however, be required to include as a beneficiary any person whom there is reason to believe would be excluded by the ward.

       Conservator for incompetent person — Disability to contract.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If a person, by reason of disability or upon his or her own election, is unable to properly care for his or her property, the probate court of the town in which he or she resides, upon his or her petition, or the petition of one or more of his or her relatives or friends, may appoint a conservator of his or her property. Upon the filing of the petition, the court shall appoint a time and place for a hearing, and shall cause at least fourteen (14) days’ notice of the hearing to be given to the person for whom a conservator is to be appointed if he or she is not the petitioner. If, at the hearing, it appears that the person is incapable of properly caring for his or her property, a conservator shall be appointed, who shall have the charge and management of the property of the person subject to the direction of the court. No person convicted of a felony offense involving a charge of forgery, embezzlement, obtaining money under false pretenses, bribery, larceny, extortion, conspiracy to defraud, burglary, breaking and entering, or any other offense involving fraud or theft shall be qualified for appointment as a conservator. The conservator may be discharged by the probate court upon the application of the ward, or otherwise, when it appears that the conservatorship is no longer necessary. After the filing of the petition, the person shall be under the same disability to contract as a person for whom an application for guardianship has been made is under by virtue of the provisions of § 33-15-13.

        It is undoubtedly the safer and wiser course for the conservator to seek permission of the probate court before paying a ward’s bills from the principal of the estate, but he may pay them, assuming that they are proper bills, and take his chance on having the payments approved later by the probate court.

       The father and mother shall be the joint natural guardians of their minor children and shall be equally charged with their care, nurture, welfare and education; and they may be sued either jointly or separately for the support of their minor children. To the extent that any such minor child has property or an estate of his or her own, or that there is income or principal of any trust for his or her benefit, which may be used to provide the child with an education in a college, university or private school, the natural guardians shall not be obligated either jointly or separately to provide an education. The foregoing sentence shall not be deemed to create by implication any obligation to provide an education where none would otherwise exist. The natural guardians shall have equal powers and rights and neither shall have any right paramount to the right of the other concerning the custody of the minor children, and both shall be entitled to their services, and to their earnings, the payment of which to either parent shall be a valid and sufficient discharge to the employer of the children until after notice in writing has been given to him or her by both or either of the parents of their intention to both claim the earnings.

        Where a parent executed a release of both her and her minor son’s claims for damages, the release was valid and binding as to any claim on her behalf arising out of her son’s injuries, but was not binding as to the son’s claims on his own behalf, where the son’s claims exceeded $1,000 (now $5,000).

         Settlement Agreement on Behalf of Minor.

       <p>
        Although a father has no authority to enter into a binding settlement agreement on behalf of a minor child whose mother had custody under a divorce decree, the agreement is not entirely void, but is voidable only. The agreement could be ratified by the child after he comes of age and would have to be disaffirmed by him within a reasonable time after attaining majority. Sabourin ex rel. Sabourin v. LBC, Inc.,

     <p>
      Whenever the family court places a child in the care and custody of the state, it shall enter an order indicating whether the parents or guardian are to be allowed to continue to make educational decisions on behalf of the child. At the same time, the family court shall make a factual determination pursuant to § 16-64-1 as to the residence of the child’s parent(s) or guardian on the date that the child is placed in the care and custody of the state, subject to § 16-64-6. Thereafter, while the child is in the care of the state, the director of DCYF shall have the duty to update the child’s parent’s residence in accordance with § 42-72.4-1. If the family court enters an order vesting the right to control a child’s education with a state agency, and if the court or the state agency finds that the child is in need of special education, or that the child is suspected of being in need of special education, the court or state agency shall request the commissioner of elementary and secondary education to appoint an educational advocate to exercise the child’s due process rights under applicable state and federal special education laws and regulations. The commissioner of elementary and secondary education shall also have the power to appoint an educational advocate when a child’s parents or guardian cannot be identified or when the whereabouts of a parent cannot be determined. If a parent is identified or the whereabouts of the parent become known, then the commissioner shall terminate the appointment of the educational advocate. An educational advocate, acting in good faith, shall be immune from any liability resulting from the performance of his or her duties as an educational advocate.

      Instead of the above bond, an executor, if so authorized by the will, or if he or she be the residuary legatee of the will, may give a bond to the probate court in a sum and with surety satisfactory to the court, and with condition to pay the funeral charges, debts and legacies of the testator and any allowance as may be made by the court for the support of the widow and family of the testator. In this case, an executor shall not be required to return an inventory, and an executor who is a residuary legatee need not render an account to the probate court. The giving of bond shall not discharge the lien on the real property of the testator for the payment of his or her debts, except on any part as may be sold by his or her executor or administrator with the will annexed to a purchaser in good faith and for valuable consideration; and all property not so sold may be taken on execution by a creditor not otherwise satisfied, in like manner as if a bond had been given in the other form.

     <p>
      Upon a bond taken by a probate court, the surety, or his or her heirs, executors, or administrators, may at any time make written application to the court for relief from further liability on the bond, and thereupon the court shall cause reasonable notice of the application to be given to the principal on the bond and to all persons whom the court shall find to be directly interested in the estate for the security of which the bond was given, to appear and be heard upon the application. If it appears that the petition can be granted without prejudice to the estate, the court may order the principal to give, within such time as it may limit, a new probate bond; and if the order is not complied with, may remove him or her and appoint a successor. If the new bonds be duly given and approved, the surety on the original bond and his or her representatives shall not be liable for any breach thereafter committed, nor shall the surety or sureties on the succeeding bond be liable for any default occurring prior to the approval of the new bond. In any case where the surety upon any bond has become liable on the bond, he or she shall have liberty to institute any proper suit against his or her principal for his or her protection.

The executor, administrator, or guardian may, if empowered by the mortgage or by law, and if in his or her discretion it is necessary to prevent a sacrifice of the property, bid upon and buy in the mortgaged property at the sale; and having so purchased, may, on application to the probate court, be authorized to resell the property at public or private sale pursuant to the direction of the court, and convey, without being accountable for any resulting loss. The proceeds of the sale shall be personal property.

     <p>
      If an executor, administrator, or guardian has paid or delivered to the persons entitled thereto the money or other property in his or her hands as required by a decree of a probate court, he or she may perpetuate the evidence of payment or delivery by presenting to the court, within one year after the decree is made, an account of the payments or delivery, together with the vouchers therefor, which shall be kept in the files of the court. The account, being proved to the satisfaction of the court, and verified by the oath of the executor, administrator, or guardian, shall be allowed as his or her final discharge and ordered to be recorded. This discharge shall forever exonerate the executor, administrator, or guardian, and his or her sureties, from all liability under the decree unless his or her account is impeached for fraud or manifest errors.

        Guardian breached no fiduciary duty because (1) nothing showed the guardian changed designations of beneficiaries of the deceased ward’s assets, (2) any change in investment vehicles only sought to appreciate the decedent’s estate, (3) the ward, while alive, independently disposed of the ward’s assets, and (4) the guardian’s failure to disclose the guardian’s joint ownership of some of the ward’s investment accounts was no fiduciary breach, as nothing showed the guardian used the estate’s income to support the guardian or anyone except the ward, and the guardian would have had the same interest in the accounts had the guardian not been guardian.

     <p>
      The probate court may authorize executors, administrators, and guardians, at their option, to sell real estate of a deceased or of a ward, either at public auction or by private contract. The court, on petition with notice, if satisfied that the action will not be prejudicial to the interests of the estate, may authorize the petitioner to become the purchaser of the real estate, at public or private sale; provided, however, that, in any instance, if a sale be made by private contract, the sale shall be made for not less than the sum fixed by the court in its decree authorizing the sale.

      The court may make orders for the care, custody, leasing, and investing of the property and its proceeds. The court may order livestock or perishable property, or any property, which cannot be kept without great and disproportionate expense, to be sold at public or private sale. The court may, upon petition of the receiver, and after the notice as is required in case of sale of real estate by executors and administrators, order all or any part of the real and personal estate of the absentee to be sold at public or private sale to supply money for the payments authorized by §§ 33-20-1 — 33-20-7 or for reinvestment approved by the court. The court, on petition with notice, if satisfied that the action will not be prejudicial to the interests of the estate, may authorize the petitioner to become the purchaser of the real estate, at public or private sale; provided, however, that, in any instance, if the sale is made by private contract, the sale shall be made for not less than the sum fixed by the court in its decree authorizing the sale.

      When before or at the hearing on any proceeding in a probate court it appears to the court that the interest of a person unborn, unascertained, or legally incompetent to act in his or her own behalf, is not fully represented, the court may appoint some competent and disinterested person to act as guardian ad litem, or next friend, for the person unborn, unascertained, or legally incompetent, and to represent his or her interest in the case. The person so appointed shall make oath to perform his or her duty faithfully and impartially, and shall be entitled to such reasonable compensation, out of the estate, for his or her services, as the court may allow. In any action involving wills, estates, trusts or fiduciaries in the probate court, a minor, an incapacitated person or an unborn or unascertained person whose identity and location is unknown and not reasonably ascertainable, unless otherwise represented, may be represented by and bound by another having a substantially identical interest with respect to the particular question or dispute, but only to the extent that: (1) the person’s interest is adequately represented; and (2) there is no conflict of interest between the representative and the person represented.

       <p>
        Amount of attorney’s fees awarded ($7,875) constituted a partially unsustainable exercise of discretion on the part of the trial justice; and the case was remanded to the superior court with the direction that it enter instead an award of $5,906.25 in attorney’s fees. The award of attorney’s fees in this particular case moderately exceeded what was called for under the totality of the circumstances, especially in view of the fact that other sanctions were subsequently imposed.

        Tenant’s appeal of a probate court’s judgment to a superior court was properly dismissed because the tenant did not make a good faith effort to comply with R.I. Gen. Laws § 33-23-1, as (1) the tenant failed to submit any records from the probate court proceedings, (2) the tenant fatally neglected to file a claim of appeal with the probate court, which was an all-important condition precedent for the taking of an effective appeal, and (3) the superior court did not have the discretion to overlook the tenant’s failure to comply with the jurisdictional requirements of R.I.

        Although a trial court properly dismissed a probate appeal by two of a decedent’s heirs because their signatures were not on the claim of appeal, the trial court erred in dismissing the probate appeal by a third heir because the third heir was the only party that satisfied R.I. Gen. Laws § 33-23-1(a)(1), and the consent order, in which the parties stipulated to the appeal and framed the issues that were to form the basis of the appeal to the trial court, was sufficient to provide notice and to confine the appeal to those enumerated issues; the consent order was referred within and attached to the claim of appeal when it was filed in the probate court, and was filed within the thirty-day time limitation of § 33-23-1(a)(2).

        Trial court did not err in dismissing appeals from a probate court order because appellants did not merely fail to produce a transcript of the probate court proceedings, but they failed to produce anything beyond that court’s decision and their own reasons for appeal; the trial court correctly held that R.I.

        Only those orders of the Probate Courts that contain an element of finality, including the appointment of an executor, an administrator C.T.A., or an administrator, or an order admitting or refusing to admit a will to probate, are orders that are sufficiently final and thereby appealable to the Superior Court pursuant to R.I.G.L. § 33-23-1.

        Because the differences between a surviving spouse’s two claims were de minimis, amounting to the elimination of surplus verbiage that was neither substantive nor material, there was no question that either of the two filed claims was sufficient to provide notice and to confine the appeal to those enumerated issues identically stated in both; a certified copy of the second claim was filed in the Superior Court within the 30-day time limitation.

        Because a surviving spouse perfected her probate appeal, the superior court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the executrix; the spouse claimed that she paid sufficient fees for a certified copy of the first claim of appeal, which was virtually identical to her second claim, and the probate court clerk indicated in her affidavit that when a certified copy was requested, it was the practice of the clerk’s office to issue that copy the same day.

        The superior court has power to hear and decide motions of persons alleging interested-party status in a probate appeal pending in that court, but the power must not be exercised arbitrarily. Spooner v. Tucker,

        Where a probate appeal is pending in superior court and persons by motion allege interested-party status therein, in the absence of a sworn motion or petition by such persons, it is incumbent upon the court to receive evidence to determine whether such persons are parties in interest when their motion has been objected to by parties already in the case.

        The court may permit any interested party to enter an appearance either in the status of a party appellee or a party appellant, as his interests may require, however the party seeking to be added as a party appellant must show that he has an interest in the estate and that he is aggrieved by the decree.

        Superior court properly granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on plaintiff’s undue influence claim because plaintiff’s primary contention that the attorney used certain knowledge that he obtained while representing plaintiff to then later unduly influence plaintiff’s father when preparing the new will was pure, unsubstantiated speculation that was wholly unsupported in the record as the father specifically addressed in the will why he decided to exclude plaintiff from any share in the trust; and because plaintiff’s broad-based allegations were not sufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment without the production of competent evidence that proved the existence of a disputed issue of material fact.

        Apportionment of attorneys’ fees and expenses of administration between a life tenant and a remainderman was error because the life estate was taken subject only to any encumbrance or secured lien on the property that existed at time of the decedent’s death, and the apportioned costs were not encumbrances or liens; these expenses, including legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses, were separate and apart from the closing costs associated with the sale of the real estate at issue, which properly were allocated.

       <p>
        The illusory transfer test is the proper test to be used when determining whether a now-deceased spouse’s inter vivos transfer of real property is sufficient to defeat a surviving spouse’s statutory share pursuant to this section. Pezza v. Pezza,
        <cite class="ocri">
         690 A.2d 345

       </p>
       <p>
        R.I. Gen. Laws § 33-25-2(b) and the illusory transfer test are incompatible; the illusory transfer test was adopted in the absence of any legislative determination respecting inter vivos trusts of real property or whether a transfer to a trust is sufficient to defeat a surviving spouse’s right to a life estate, and by its enactment of R.I. Gen. Laws § 33-25-2(b), the General Assembly has spoken in the clearest of terms, and has declared that the only predicate to defeating a surviving spouse’s right to a life estate is a conveyance of the real estate that is recorded prior to death.
