        Comparing the language of this section with the terms of § 13-6-3, the supreme court found that each clearly serves a separate statutory purpose. Bogosian v. Vaccaro,

        It was no error to dismiss an inmate’s tort claims; while the court had subject matter jurisdiction, the court did not have authority to proceed, as (1) the inmate was serving a life sentence, (2) the Legislature had unambiguously mandated in R.I. Gen. Laws 13-6-1 that persons serving life sentences were prohibited from asserting civil actions, and (3) the inmate did not fall under any exception to that statute. Gallop v. Adult Corr. Insts.,

        Issue of whether this section, the civil death statute, was unconstitutional was barred by the “raise-or-waive” rule and procedural law; plaintiff’s opportunity to challenge the civil death statute’s constitutionality before the appellate court was confined to federal civil rights claims, but those claims were not before the trial court and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiff’s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.

        The permissive portions of § 13-6-3 refer to a prisoner who receives something less than a life sentence. Such an individual cannot be equated with the civilly dead referred to in this section. Bogosian v. Vaccaro,

        Inmate’s request to have the record of the inmate’s allegedly invalid marriage sealed was properly denied, and the inmate had no right to appeal that denial, because, as the inmate had been sentenced to life in prison, the inmate had no right to have the record sealed, as the inmate was “civilly dead” under this section, and, for that reason, the inmate had no right to litigate the issue, and the trial court had no authority to entertain any issue except whether the inmate was in fact civilly dead.

        Issue of the invalidity under R.I. Gen. Laws § 13-6-3 of a mortgage from a son to a father signed while the son was incarcerated was moot because the debt secured by the mortgage had been paid and the father had executed a discharge, but even if it had not been moot, a trial court properly applied equitable principles to preclude the son from denying its validity when he testified that the execution of the mortgage was his idea.

      Whenever any person shall be imprisoned in the adult correctional institutions for life or for a term of seven (7) years or more, any creditor of that person may apply to the probate court of the city or town in which the prisoner last lived and was domiciled in this state, or in which he or she shall have any estate, for letters of administration to be granted on the prisoner’s estate to the prisoner’s next of kin or to any disinterested person, during the imprisonment.

       If a prisoner is confined upon more than one sentence, a parole permit may be issued whenever he or she has served a term equal to one-third (1/3) of the aggregate time which he or she shall be liable to serve under his or her several sentences, unless he or she has been sentenced to serve two (2) or more terms concurrently, in which case the permit shall be issued when he or she has served a term equal to one-third (1/3) of the maximum term he or she is required to serve.

      <li id="t13c08s13-8-10ol1b">
       If a prisoner, whether in confinement or on parole, is sentenced to serve a term of imprisonment for an offense which was committed after imposition of the sentence then being served, a permit may not be issued until he or she has served in confinement at least one-third (1/3) of the term of imprisonment to which he or she is sentenced for the subsequent offense. In calculating the date the prisoner shall become eligible for a permit, the time spent in confinement on an earlier imposed concurrent sentence shall not be credited for the purposes of parole eligibility on the subsequent sentence. In the event a prisoner is convicted of two (2) or more subsequent offenses and is sentenced to multiple terms of imprisonment for those offenses, the standards contained in subsection (a) of this section shall be used to determine when he or she has served one-third (1/3) of the terms of confinement imposed for the subsequent offenses and thereby is eligible for issuance of a permit under this subsection.

        A parole board’s action in first giving a convict eligibility status for parole and then subsequently taking it away based on its reinterpretation of the parole eligibility statutes did not violate due process. Lerner v. Gill,
        <cite class="ocri">

       <p>
        A parole-board determination in regard to a convict’s parole-eligibility status was not the equivalent of a rule subject to the ex post facto clauses of the Rhode Island and United States Constitutions. Lerner v. Gill,

        Where the statute on parole eligibility had not been changed, procedural guidelines adopted and applied by the parole board after sentencing of a petitioner were not in violation of the prohibition against ex post facto laws. Skawinski v. State,

        The trial court properly applied § 13-8-13 to require that the defendant serve ten years of concurrent life sentences and an additional ten years on a consecutive life sentence before becoming eligible for parole. DeCiantis v. State,

        Inmate’s claim that the inmate was unlawfully incarcerated failed because the inmate’s interpretation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 13-8-10(a) to require the inmate’s parole after serving one-third of the inmate’s maximum sentence ignored the discretion of the parole board. Brown v. State,

        A parole board’s action in first giving a convict eligibility status for parole and then subsequently taking it away based on its reinterpretation of the parole eligibility statutes did not violate due process. Lerner v. Gill,

        A parole-board determination in regard to a convict’s parole-eligibility status was not the equivalent of a rule subject to ex post facto clauses of the Rhode Island and United States Constitutions. Lerner v. Gill,

        Where a prisoner is informed by the parole board and believes that he is parole eligible, and this action of the parole board is based upon a rational if not correct application of the statute in an area of the board’s particular expertise, i.e., this section, a revocation of that status, both rationally and on the basis of authority, is an unlawful ex post facto exposition, and the prisoner should be considered to be eligible for consideration for a parole permit.

        The state supreme court’s construction of this section, as amended in 1970, that a prisoner who had been sentenced to two consecutive life sentences had to serve ten years for each sentence, consecutively, for a total of 20 years, before becoming eligible for parole, was not so unforeseeable, and the defendant’s reliance on a prior attorney general’s interpretation, that the defendant was eligible for parole after serving ten years, was not so prejudicial, as to amount to a denial of due process.

        Minimal due process requires that any parole denial be accompanied by a written statement from the parole board, containing the grounds for the decision and the underlying factors supporting those grounds, sufficient to enable a reviewing court to determine whether parole was denied for permissible reasons.

       At least once each calendar year the parole board shall adopt standards to be utilized by the board in evaluating applications for parole of persons convicted of a criminal offense and sentenced to the adult correctional institutions. These standards shall establish, with the range of parole eligibility set by statute, the portion of a sentence which should be served depending on the likelihood of recidivism as determined by a risk assessment, and shall serve as guidelines for the board in making individual parole determinations.

       The board shall consider the applicable standard prior to rendering a decision on a parole application, and may make a determination at variance with that standard only upon a finding that the determination is warranted by individualized factors, such as the character, criminal history, and attitudes of the applicant that bear on the likelihood to reoffend, the conduct of the applicant while incarcerated, including meaningful participation in a risk-reducing program and substantial compliance with the rules of the institution, and risk-reducing behavior and the criteria set forth in § 13-8-14. “Risk-reducing program” means a program that adheres to those elements that are shown in research to reduce recidivism.

        The parole board did not act arbitrarily in denying the request for parole of a prisoner convicted of first-degree sexual assault in 1981 and sentenced to life imprisonment, because the prisoner was not eligible for parole until he had served at least 15 years. The Rhode Island Parole Board Guidelines provide that “a person convicted and sentenced to prison on a charge of first-degree sexual assault . . . should serve two-thirds (2/3) of his/her sentence before being considered for parole release”. Since the board employed a period of 30 years when computing the parole eligibility of an inmate serving a life sentence, it would have been completely justified in ruling that the prisoner would not have been eligible for parole consideration until 20 years (not to mention 15 years) had elapsed, which by clear implication would have been two-thirds of the life sentence.

      The parole board may, by a majority vote of all of its members, revoke, in accordance with the provisions of § 13-8-18.1, any permit issued by it to any prisoner under the provisions of this chapter or revoke any permit issued by another state or jurisdiction where the prisoner is being supervised by the Rhode Island parole board whenever it shall appear to the board that the prisoner has violated any of the terms or conditions of his or her permit or conditions of parole set by an out-of-state jurisdiction, or has during the period of his or her parole violated any state laws. Whenever it shall come to the knowledge of the board that any prisoner at liberty under a permit issued by this state or another state or jurisdiction has been guilty of a violation of parole related to a new criminal charge, the chairperson shall issue his or her warrant to any officer authorized to serve criminal process to arrest the prisoner and commit him or her to the adult correctional institutions, to be detained until the board shall have an opportunity to determine whether the permit of the prisoner is to be revoked in accordance with the provisions of § 13-8-18.1, or in the case of prisoners granted parole by another state or jurisdiction, and supervised by the Rhode Island parole board, until that state or jurisdiction takes custody of the prisoner. Whenever it shall come to the knowledge of the board that any prisoner at liberty under a permit issued by this state or another state or jurisdiction has been guilty of a technical violation of parole, absent a new criminal charge, the chairperson may, at his or her discretion, issue his or her warrant to any officer authorized to serve criminal process to arrest the prisoner and commit him or her to the adult correctional institutions, to be detained until the board shall have an opportunity to determine whether the permit of the prisoner is to be revoked in accordance with the provisions of § 13-8-18.1, or in the case of prisoners granted parole by another state or jurisdiction, and supervised by the Rhode Island parole board, until that state or jurisdiction takes custody of the prisoner. If the board shall determine that the permit shall not be revoked, then the board shall immediately order the prisoner to be set at liberty under the terms and conditions of his or her original permit.

        Where a parole board issued a detention warrant for a prisoner and, after his apprehension, on the erroneous theory that the indorsement of an erroneous expiration date of his term on his parole permit rendered it void, withdrew the warrant and recommitted him, without a hearing to revoke his parole, such recommitment was error and the prisoner was entitled to be released.

        Although the evidentiary standards in a violation hearing are not as rigid as those which are applicable in a criminal trial, nevertheless, the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses is required, unless the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not allowing confrontation.

       </p>
       <p>
        Before admitting hearsay, particularly on issues which are central to the determination of the commission of a parole violation, the trial justice must determine whether there is good cause for denying confrontation and/or cross-examination. State v. DeRoche,

      <li id="t13c08s13-8-18.1ol1a">
       As soon as is practicable after a detention for an alleged violation of parole, the parole board shall afford the alleged parole violator a preliminary parole revocation hearing before a hearing officer designated by the board. The hearing officer shall not have had any prior supervisory involvement over the alleged violator.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c08s13-8-18.1ol1b">
       The alleged violator shall, within five (5) days of the detention, in Rhode Island be given written notice of the time, place, and purpose of the preliminary hearing. The notice shall state the specific conditions of parole that are alleged to have been violated and in what manner. The notice shall also inform the alleged violator of the following rights in connection with the preliminary hearing:
       <ol>
        <li id="t13c08s13-8-18.1ol1b1">
         The right to appear and speak in his or her own behalf;

         The right to call witnesses and present evidence;

        <li id="t13c08s13-8-18.1ol1b3">
         The right to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him or her, unless the hearing officer finds on the record that a witness may be subjected to risk of harm if his or her identity is revealed; and
        </li>
        <li id="t13c08s13-8-18.1ol1b4">
         The right to retain counsel and, if unable to afford counsel, the right under certain circumstances to the appointment of counsel for the preliminary hearing.
         <p id="t13c08s13-8-18.1ol1b4.1">
          The determination of whether or not the alleged violator is entitled to appointed counsel, if such a request is made, shall be made on the record and in accordance with all relevant statutory and constitutional provisions.
         </p>
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t13c08s13-8-18.1ol1c">
       The notice form must explain in clear and unambiguous language the procedures established by the parole board concerning an alleged violator’s exercise of the rights denominated in subsection (b), including the mechanism for compelling the attendance of witnesses; the mechanism for obtaining documentary evidence; and the mechanism for requesting the appointment of counsel.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c08s13-8-18.1ol1d">
       The preliminary hearing shall take place no later than ten (10) days after service of notice set forth in subsection (b). A preliminary hearing may be postponed beyond the ten-day (10) time limit for good cause at the request of either party, but may not be postponed at the request of the state for more than five (5) additional days. The parole revocation charges shall be dismissed with prejudice if a preliminary hearing is not conducted within the time period established by this paragraph, not including any delay directly attributed to a postponement requested by the alleged violator.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c08s13-8-18.1ol1e">
       If the alleged violator has requested the appointment of counsel at least five (5) days prior to the preliminary hearing, the preliminary hearing may not proceed without counsel present unless the hearing officer finds on the record, in accordance with all relevant statutory and constitutional provisions, that the alleged violator is not entitled to appointed counsel. If the alleged violator is found to have been entitled to counsel and no such counsel has been appointed, the parole violation charges must be dismissed with prejudice. If the request for counsel was made four (4) or fewer days in advance of the preliminary hearing, the time limit within which the preliminary hearing must be held may be extended up to five (5) additional days.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c08s13-8-18.1ol1f">
       The standard of proof at the preliminary hearing shall be probable cause to believe that the alleged violator has violated one or more conditions of his or her parole and that the violation or violations were not de minimus in nature. Proof of conviction of a crime committed subsequent to release on parole shall constitute probable cause for the purposes of the preliminary hearing.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c08s13-8-18.1ol1g">
       At the preliminary hearing, the hearing officer shall review the violation charges with the alleged violator; direct the presentation of the evidence concerning the alleged violation; receive the statements of the witnesses and documentary evidence; and allow cross-examination of those witnesses in attendance. All proceedings shall be recorded and preserved.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c08s13-8-18.1ol1h">
       At the conclusion of the preliminary hearing, the hearing officer shall inform the alleged violator of his or her decision as to whether there is probable cause to believe that the alleged violator has violated one or more conditions of his or her parole and, if so, whether the violation or violations were de minimus in nature. Those determinations shall be based solely on the evidence adduced at the preliminary hearing. The hearing officer shall state in writing the reasons for his or her determinations and the evidence relied upon for those determinations. A copy of the written findings shall be sent to the alleged violator, and his or her counsel if applicable, within fourteen (14) days of the preliminary hearing.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c08s13-8-18.1ol1i">
       If the hearing officer finds that there is no probable cause to believe that the alleged violator has violated one or more conditions of his or her parole or that the violation or violations, if any, were de minimus in nature, the parole chairperson shall rescind the detention warrant and direct that the alleged violator, unless in custody for other reasons, be released and restored to parole supervision.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c08s13-8-18.1ol1j">
       If the hearing officer finds that there is probable cause to believe that the alleged violator has violated one or more conditions of his or her parole and that the violation or violations were not de minimus in nature, the alleged violator shall be held for a final parole revocation hearing. A final parole revocation hearing must be held as soon as is practicable, but in no event more than ninety (90) days after the conclusion of the preliminary hearing.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c08s13-8-18.1ol1k">
       An alleged violator may waive his or her right to a preliminary hearing. The waiver must be in written form. In the event of such a written waiver, a final parole revocation hearing must be held as soon as is practicable, but in no event more than ninety (90) days after the right to a preliminary hearing is waived. Notwithstanding the above, a final parole revocation hearing may be continued by the alleged violator beyond the ninety-day (90) time period. For parole violations not involving a new criminal offense, an alleged violator may waive his or her right to a final parole revocation hearing, where there is no dispute as to the alleged violation and the parolee charged with the violation(s) freely admits to the violation and accepts the appropriate sanction imposed by the parole board.

       Manner of obtaining information by parole board.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The parole board, in the discharge of its duties under this chapter, shall not be required to receive or consider any petition, and it may secure the information upon which it exercises its authority, or upon which it makes its findings in any case, in any manner and by any means that it may consider most fitting to carry out the purposes of this chapter; provided, it shall be the duty of the clerks of courts, the sheriffs and their deputies, the police officers of cities and towns, the probation officers, the officers of the adult correctional institutions, and every person having charge of any other place where prisoners are confined or detained, to furnish to the board and to any member of the board, whenever requested by the board or by any member of it, any and all information they may have relating to the character and history of any prisoner whose sentence is placed under the control of the board by this chapter. In the case of prisoners transferred to federal institutions under the provisions of § 13-12-1, the board may, in its discretion, arrange to obtain information concerning those prisoners from the appropriate officials of the United States Bureau of Prisons. That information shall include, but not be limited to, testimony of the prisoner being considered for parole, and official records and reports, including recommendations concerning the prisoners. The board is authorized to request of the contracting authority the inclusion of provisions for obtaining that information in contracts made pursuant to § 13-12-1.

       A person under community supervision shall be under the jurisdiction, supervision and control of the parole board in the same manner as a person under parole supervision. The board is authorized on an individual basis to establish any conditions of community supervision that may be necessary to ensure public safety, which may include protecting the public from a person committing a sex offense including child molestation or child kidnapping as well as promoting the rehabilitation of the person. The conditions shall include at the expense of the offender sex offender treatment with a recognized treatment provider in the field to be determined by the board for as long as the board deems necessary, and compliance with the requirements of chapter 37 of title 11.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c08s13-8-32ol1c">
       The board is authorized to impose and enforce a supervision fee, and rehabilitation fee upon a person on community supervision. To the extent possible the board shall set the fee in an amount that will substantially defray the cost of the community supervision program.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c08s13-8-32ol1d">
       The board shall also establish a fee waiver procedure for hardship cases and indigency.

       After a person sentenced to community supervision has been under supervision for a period of fifteen (15) years or any time after the person ceases to be a resident of the state, the person may petition the board for termination of community supervision. A petition for termination which is based upon the person no longer being a resident of Rhode Island shall be accompanied by an affidavit of the person attesting to his or her non-residency and providing his or her new out of state address. A petition for termination which is based upon the completion of fifteen (15) years of community supervision may only occur by a majority vote of all the members of the community supervision board. Termination may only occur by a majority vote of all the members. Upon receiving a petition for termination, the board shall, within sixty (60) days, conduct a hearing before the full membership. At least thirty (30) days prior to a hearing on the petition, the board shall cause a criminal history check to be conducted, and notify in writing the victims of the crime for which the sentence was imposed, the attorney general, and the chief of police or head of the organized police department of the municipality in which the crime was committed, and the chief of police or head of the organized police department of the municipality in which the person resides, of the person’s petition for release from community supervision. Those officials and victims shall be provided the opportunity to respond to the petition. The officials and victims may appear in person or be represented or make written recommendations to the board, but failure of any or all of the officials to appear or make recommendations shall not delay the termination procedure.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c08s13-8-32ol1f">
       If a victim is deceased at the time the termination hearing is scheduled the deceased victim may be represented by his relatives in the following order: mother, father, spouse, child, grandchild, brother or sister, niece or nephew.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c08s13-8-32ol1g">
       Prior to the hearing, the petitioner shall be examined, personally interviewed and evaluated by a psychiatrist or licensed psychologist, who is an expert in the field of sex offender treatment and approved by the board. The psychiatrist or psychologist shall file written reports with the board of his or her examinations and diagnoses, and his or her recommendation for the disposition of the person. The petitioner’s treatment while on community supervision shall be examined and considered by the psychiatrist or psychologist in the recommendation. The reports shall be admissible in a hearing pursuant to this section. If the person refuses, without good cause, to be personally interviewed by the psychiatrist or psychologist, the person shall be deemed to have waived his or her right to a hearing on the petition, and the petition shall be dismissed by the board. The cost of the examination and evaluation shall be the responsibility of the person petitioning for release from supervision; provided, that procedures shall be established for cases of hardship or indigency.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c08s13-8-32ol1h">
       At the hearing, the board shall call any witnesses that it deems necessary, including the examining psychiatrist or psychologist, the attorney general, the police chief or the victims of the crime or his or her family member, as the board deems necessary. The petitioner may offer any witnesses and other proof at the hearing that is relevant to the petition.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c08s13-8-32ol1i">
       The board shall terminate community supervision if the petitioner demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that he or she has not committed a sex offense of child kidnapping since his or her conviction, that he or she is not likely to pose a threat to the safety of others, and that the public interest is not served by further community supervision.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c08s13-8-32ol1j">
       If a petition for release from supervision is denied by the board, the person may not file another petition for a period of three (3) years.

       Upon its own motion or upon request of a parolee, the parole board may terminate a parolee’s supervision before the sentence expires.

        <li id="t13c08s13-8-35ol1a1">
         Seven (7) years after releasing a prisoner on supervision, and at least annually thereafter, the parole board shall review the status of the parolee to determine the need for continued supervision. The parole board shall also conduct a status review whenever the supervision officer recommends early termination of the parolee’s supervision.
        </li>
        <li id="t13c08s13-8-35ol1a2">
         Seven (7) years after releasing a prisoner on supervision, excluding a parolee serving a life sentence for first- or second-degree murder, the parole board shall terminate supervision over the parolee unless the parole board determines, after a hearing in accordance with this chapter, that  the supervision should not be terminated because there is a likelihood that the parolee will engage in conduct violating any criminal law. If the parole board does not terminate supervision under this subsection, the parolee may request a hearing annually thereafter, and the parole board shall conduct an early termination hearing at least every two (2) years.
        </li>

         In calculating the two-year (2) and seven-year (7) periods provided in this section, the parole board shall not include any period of parole before the recent release, or any period served in confinement or any other sentence.

       The parole board shall promulgate guidelines  that effectuate the purpose of this section, which is to provide a mechanism for eliminating supervision on parole, in deserving cases, consistent with the rehabilitative and reentry needs of the parolee and the promotion of public safety.
       <p id="t13c08s13-8-35ol1b.1">
        In determining whether to grant early termination from supervision, the parole board shall consider its guidelines and promulgate new guidelines so as to effectuate the purpose of this section, which is to provide a mechanism for eliminating supervision on parole, in deserving cases, consistent with the rehabilitative and reentry needs of the parolee and the promotion of public safety. Termination of supervision is indicated if the parolee:
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li id="t13c08s13-8-35ol1b1">

       Case-specific factors that may justify a departure either above or below the early termination may relate to the current behavior of the parolee, or the parolee’s background and criminal history.

       The parole board is authorized to grant geriatric parole release of a prisoner, except a prisoner serving life without parole, who is an aging prisoner within the meaning of § 13-8.1-3(1) or under medical parole as outlined by § 13-8.1-2.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c8.1s13-8.1-4ol1c">
       In order to apply for this relief, the prisoner or his or her family member or friend, with an attending physician’s written approval, or an attending physician, on behalf of the prisoner, shall file an application with the director of the department of corrections. Within seventy-two (72) hours after the filing of any application, the director shall refer the application to the health service unit of the department of corrections for a medical report and a medical or geriatric discharge plan to be completed within ten (10) days. Upon receipt of the discharge plan, the director of the department of corrections shall immediately transfer the discharge plan, together with the application, to the parole board for its consideration and decision.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, medical or geriatric release may be granted at any time during the term of a prisoner’s sentence.

The evaluation shall be completed and a report, containing the information required by subsection (d) of this section, filed with the director and the parole board, and a copy sent to the applicant within fourteen (14) days from the date of the request.

Denial of release does not preclude the prisoner from reapplying for medical or geriatric parole after the expiration of sixty (60) days. A reapplication under this section must demonstrate a material change in circumstances.

     </h3>
     <p>
      There is hereby established a certificate of recovery &amp; re-entry for individuals that are convicted of a crime in which their legal status and ability to seek and maintain employment changes forever. A criminal record may prohibit individuals from successfully obtaining jobs, occupational licenses, housing and other benefits and opportunities available to all other individuals. These restrictions are often narrowly tailored and serve to protect society against an unidentified public safety risk, but others are arbitrary, unnecessary and without regard to any post-conviction rehabilitation or recovery &amp; re-entry. Individuals who have successfully completed their board-imposed sentences need to be able to reestablish themselves as law-abiding members of society. At the same time, employers and other decision-makers need to have some reassurance of a person’s reliability. Therefore, the intent and purpose of this chapter is to provide a process that would, in select and appropriate cases, allow the issuance of a certificate of recovery &amp; re-entry. Said certificate, if granted by the parole board, would serve to relieve the petitioner, in appropriate cases, of some of the collateral consequences resulting from his or her criminal record. Said certificate shall serve as one determining factor as to whether the petitioner has been successful in his or her rehabilitation.

          Before granting permission, opportunity shall be granted to the receiving state to investigate the home and prospective employment of the person.

         <p id="t13c09s13-9-2-historyofsectionol11b.2">
          A “resident of the receiving state”, within the meaning of this section, is one who has been an actual continuous inhabitant of the state for more than one year prior to his or her coming to the sending state and has not resided within the sending state more than six (6) continuous months immediately preceding the commission of the offense for which he or she has been convicted.

       That duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any person on probation or parole. For that purpose no formalities will be required other than establishing the authority of the officer and the identity of the person to be retaken. All legal requirements to obtain extradition of fugitives from justice are expressly waived on the part of states party to this compact, as to persons to be apprehended or retaken. The decision of the sending state to retake a person on probation or parole shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state; provided, that if, at the time when a state seeks to retake a probationer or parolee, there should be pending against him or her within the receiving state any criminal charge, or he or she should be suspected of having committed within that state a criminal offense, he or she shall not be retaken without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or from imprisonment for the offense.

Renunciation of this compact shall be by the same authority which ratified it, by sending six (6) months’ notice in writing of its intention to withdraw from the compact to the other states party to this agreement.

       PURPOSE
      </p>
      <p>
       The compacting states to this interstate compact recognize the each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in the community who are authorized pursuant to the bylaws and rules of this compact to travel across state lines both to and from each compacting state in such a manner as to track the location of offenders, transfer supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner, and when necessary return offenders to the originating jurisdictions. The compacting states also recognize that congress, by enacting the crime control act,
       <cite class="ocri">
        4 U.S.C.
       </cite>
       section 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime. It is the purpose of this compact and the interstate commission created hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states: to provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community; to provide for the effective tracking, supervision, and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states; and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of the compact among the compacting states. In addition, this compact will: create a interstate commission which will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections or other criminal justice agencies which will promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this compact; ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators; monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct non-compliance; and coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity. The compacting states recognize that there is no “right” of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this compact and bylaws and rules promulgated hereunder. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the interstate commission created herein are the formation of public policies and are therefore public business.

       THE STATE COUNCIL
      </p>
      <p>
       Each member state shall create a state council for interstate adult offender supervision which shall be responsible for the appointment of the commissioner who shall serve on the interstate commission from that state. Each state council shall appoint as its commissioner the compact administrator from that state to serve on the interstate commission in such capacity under or pursuant to applicable law of the member state. While each member state may determine the membership of its own state council, its membership must include at least one representative from the legislative, judicial, and executive branches of government, victims groups and the Rhode Island compact administrator. Each compacting state retains the right to determine the qualifications of the compact administrator who shall be appointed by the governor in consultation with the legislature and the judiciary. In addition to appointment of its commissioner to the national interstate commission, each state council shall exercise oversight and advocacy concerning its participation in interstate commission activities and other duties as may be determined by each member state including, but not limited to, development of policy concerning operations and procedures of the compact within that state.

       ACTIVITIES OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION
      </p>
      <p>
       The interstate commission shall meet and take such actions as are consistent with the provisions of this compact. Except as otherwise provided in this compact and unless a greater percentage is required by the bylaws, in order to constitute an act of the interstate commission, such act shall have been taken at a meeting of the interstate commission and shall have received an affirmative vote of a majority of the members present.

The bylaws may provide for members participation in meetings by telephone or other means of telecommunication or electronic communication. Any voting conducted by telephone, or other means of telecommunication or electronic communication shall be subject to the same quorum requirements of meetings where members are present in person. The interstate commission shall meet at least once during each calendar year.

       COMPACTING STATES, EFFECTIVE DATE AND AMENDMENT
      </p>
      <p>
       Any state, as defined in Article II of this compact, is eligible to become a compacting state.
      </p>
      <p>
       The compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the compact into law by no less than thirty-five (35) of the states. The initial effective date shall be the latter of July 1, 2001, or upon enactment into law by the 35th jurisdiction. Thereafter it shall become effective and binding, as to any other compacting state, upon enactment of the compact into law by that state. The governors of nonmember states or their designees will be invited to participate in interstate commission activities on a nonvoting basis prior to adoption of the compact by all states and territories of the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       Amendments to the compact may be proposed by the interstate commission for enactment by the compacting states. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the interstate commission and the compacting states unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the compacting states.

       WITHDRAWAL, DEFAULT, TERMINATION, AND JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT
      </p>
      <p>
       Section A. Withdrawal
      </p>
      <p>
       Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every compacting state; provided, that a compacting state may withdraw from the compact (“withdrawing state”) by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute which enacted the compact into law.
      </p>
      <p>
       The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repeal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chairperson of the interstate commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state.
      </p>
      <p>
       The interstate commission shall notify the other compacting states of the withdrawing state’s intent to withdraw within sixty (60) days of its receipt thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
       The withdrawing state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state shall occur upon the withdrawing state reenacting the compact or upon such later date as determined by the interstate commission.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section B. Default
      </p>
      <p>
       If the interstate commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted (“defaulting state”) in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, the bylaws or any duly promulgated rules the interstate commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:
      </p>
      <p>
       Fines, fees and costs in such amounts as are deemed to be reasonable as fixed by the interstate commission;
      </p>
      <p>
       Remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the interstate commission;
      </p>
      <p>
       Suspension and termination of membership in the compact. Suspension shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the bylaws and rules have been exhausted. Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the interstate commission to the governor, chief justice or chief judicial officer of the state; the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature, and the state council. The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a compacting state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, interstate commission bylaws, or duly promulgated rules. The interstate commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the interstate commission on the defaulting state pending a cure of the default. The interstate commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the interstate commission, in addition to any other penalties imposed herein, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of suspension.
      </p>
      <p>
       Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of termination of a defaulting state, the interstate commission shall notify the governor, the chief justice or chief judicial officer and the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature and the state council of such termination.
      </p>
      <p>
       The defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.
      </p>
      <p>
       The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between the interstate commission and the defaulting state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires both a reenactment of the compact by the defaulting state and the approval of the interstate commission pursuant to the rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section C. Judicial enforcement
      </p>
      <p>
       The interstate commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the interstate commission, in the Federal district where the interstate commission has its offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, its duly promulgated rules and bylaws, against any compacting state in default. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorneys’ fees.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section D. Dissolution of compact
      </p>
      <p>
       The compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state which reduces membership in the compact to one (1) compacting state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the interstate commission shall be wound up and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.

       Section A. Other laws
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a compacting state that is not inconsistent with this compact.
      </p>
      <p>
       All compacting states’ laws conflicting with this compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section B. Binding effect of the compact
      </p>
      <p>
       All lawful actions of the interstate commission, including all rules and bylaws promulgated by the interstate commission, are binding upon the compacting states.
      </p>
      <p>
       All agreements between the interstate commission and the compacting states are binding in accordance with their terms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon the request of a party to a conflict over meaning or interpretation of interstate commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the compacting states, the interstate commission may issue advisory opinions regarding such meaning or interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the event any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any compacting state, the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by such provision upon the interstate commission shall be ineffective and such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the compacting state and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this compact becomes effective.

       The party states find that charges outstanding against prisoner detainers based on untried indictments, informations, or complaints and difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation. Accordingly, it is the policy of the party states and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of these charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations, or complaints. The party states also find that proceedings with reference to these charges and detainers, when emanating from another jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of cooperative procedures. It is the further purpose of this agreement to provide cooperative procedures.

        Where defense counsel inadvertently misrepresented the length of defendant’s sentence under proposed plea agreement, and as a result, defendant filed a motion for continuance seeking time to find new counsel, the motion was properly denied, in part, because defendant’s time in Rhode Island, due to defendant’s extradition, was limited pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 13-13-2. State v. Caprio,

        Since proceedings could be transferred to another county, there was no absence of subject-matter jurisdiction on the part of the motion justice who heard the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 13-13-2 arguments and ruled on defendant’s contentions in respect to several cases. State v. Werner,

        Defendant’s timeliness challenge under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act (IADA) was properly rejected as six of the nine continuances granted were attributed to defendant and the IADA was not designed to protect against delays caused by a defendant’s actions. State v. Oliver,

        Defendant waived his timeliness challenge under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act (IADA), since he did not object to the three continuances that were requested by the State and did not raise the IADA deadline during the nine continuance hearings. State v. Oliver,

        Defendant’s trial did not violate the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD) because (1) the IAD did not apply after defendant’s federal sentence was served, and (2) defendant’s suppression motions caused any trial delay. State v. Tejeda,

        Trial court’s denial of defendant’s motion to dismiss charges against him, pursuant to R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 12, based on an alleged violation of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 13-13-2, was properly denied where trials would have been commenced within the 180-day period except that continuances were required, which were found to be both necessary and reasonable, due to defendant’s demands to have new counsel appointed, to have the judge recused, and due to his uncooperativeness in returning to the State of Rhode Island; accordingly, denial of dismissal for violation of the Act and for an alleged violation of his right to a speedy trial, under R.I. Const. art. I, § 10, was proper. State v. Werner,

Gen. Laws § 13-13-2, art. III, charges independent of the probation violation led to defendant’s extradition. State v. Caprio,
