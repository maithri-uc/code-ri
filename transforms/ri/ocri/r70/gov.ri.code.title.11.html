        Since this section makes every act which is an offense at common law punishable in Rhode Island, the legislature intended to preserve and not impair or abrogate the common law. State v. LaPlume,
        <cite class="ocri">
         118 R.I. 670
        </cite>
        ,

        (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        The inherent power of the courts to punish for contempt of their authority is not controlled by this section. This section addresses offenses at common law for which the General Laws do not prescribe punishment. This statute assured that a person who had committed an offense at common law could not evade prosecution and punishment because the offense had not been declared a crime in the laws of the state. State v. Price,
        <cite class="ocri">
         672 A.2d 893

       <p>
        As conspiracy was and still is an offense at common law, a defendant may be prosecuted for conspiracy under this section by an indictment which alleged conspiracy and also referred to specific acts perpetrated in the course of the conspiracy which were separate substantive criminal offenses and were not mutually exclusive crimes and still satisfied the constitutional burden of reasonably apprising the defendant of the charges against him. State v. Giorgi,
        <cite class="ocri">

       <p>
        Although conspiracy to commit an unlawful act outside the state is now covered by § 11-1-7, it was an indictable offense under this section. State v. LaPlume,
        <cite class="ocri">

        (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since § 11-1-6 now prescribes a specific punishment for the common law crime of conspiracy, the applicability of this section to conspiracy prosecutions has been impliedly repealed. State v. Macarelli,
        <cite class="ocri">

        One defendant in a prosecution for conspiracy cannot be convicted when all of his alleged coconspirators, be they one or more, have been acquitted or been discharged under circumstances which amount to an acquittal. State v. Donato,

       </p>
       <p>
        No action in furtherance of the conspiracy beyond the making of the unlawful agreement need occur for the crime to be committed. State v. Sabitoni,

       <p>
        The crime of conspiracy is the combination of two or more persons to commit an unlawful act or to do a lawful act for an unlawful purpose. State v. Sabitoni,
        <cite class="ocri">

        Rhode Island follows the common-law rule of conspiracy, which punishes the combination of two or more persons to commit an unlawful act or a lawful act for an unlawful purpose. State v. Brown,

        Ultimately, what combination of evidence and inferences will be legally sufficient to support a verdict of guilty as an aider and abettor must be determined on a case-by-case basis. State v. Gazerro,

        Beyond mere presence, the circumstances must establish that a defendant shared in the criminal intent of the principal and there must be a community of unlawful purpose at the time the act is committed. State v. Gazerro,

        Factors not alone dispositive, but which will be considered in their totality to determine a defendant’s guilty participation as an aider and abettor include association or relationship between the perpetrator and those accused of aiding and abetting, knowledge that a crime has been committed and flight from the scene of the crime.

       <p>
        Aider and abettor may be convicted of a more serious offense or suffer a greater penalty than the principal, because under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-1-3, all who participated in a crime are severally responsible as principals, as though each had committed the offense alone. Jaiman v. State,

        Defendant was not prejudiced by what he challenged as an additional offense rather than defending against his potential liability as an aider and abettor because one who aided and abetted the commission of a crime and was present at the scene could be charged and convicted as a principal.

        Evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction on one count of aiding and abetting the crime of possession of marijuana with intent to deliver in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-1-3 where defendant, a police officer, gave a friend affirmative assistance to help the friend’s drug dealing. The evidence showed that defendant did more than merely acquiesce in the friend’s conduct, and that defendant assisted the friend by checking license plates of suspicious cars in the friend’s neighborhood and telling the friend when to “lay low” because police might have learned of the friend’s drug operation.

        In a murder prosecution, the trial court’s aiding and abetting instruction accurately reflected the law with respect to intent because it explained that only if defendant knowingly and intentionally aided and abetted could he be held responsible for the natural or probable consequences of that act.

        Trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal on a charge of aiding and abetting the manufacture and cultivation of marijuana because testimony by a witness, who entered into a cooperation agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, placed defendant at the rented property when the marijuana grow operations were underway, defendant’s actions demonstrated a shared unlawful intent to manufacture or cultivate marijuana and, further, a community of unlawful purpose existed between and among defendant, the witness, and a third person.

        Since there was sufficient evidence to convict the inmate under an aiding and abetting theory, the hearing justice erred when she held that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to propose a jury instruction or challenge the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to the aiding and abetting theory and the grant of postconviction relief was erroneous. A jury certainly could have found, and did find, that the defendant brought a gun to the scene of the crime Whitaker v. State,

        That an applicant’s accomplice was the shooter and was convicted of second-degree murder did not preclude the applicant’s conviction and sentence for first-degree murder, because under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-1-3, an aider and abettor could be convicted of a more serious offense and suffer a greater penalty than the principal. Jaiman v. State,

        Trial justice did not err when instructing the jury that it could convict defendant of manufacturing or cultivating marijuana as an aider or abettor because testimony by a witness, who entered into a cooperation agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, demonstrated that defendant was involved in the growing process both before and after the process commenced, present when the witness arrived to inspect the marijuana plants, and, once the cultivation was underway, the witness discussed the operation with defendant approximately every other day; thus, the witness’s testimony that defendant was at the property on a number of occasions was sufficient to support the jury charge with respect to aiding and abetting. State v. Long,
        <cite class="ocri">
         61 A.3d 441

       <p>
        Where several witnesses described a chaotic scene in which defendant was one of several individuals who were simultaneously attacking the victim, thus making it difficult to determine which specific attacker delivered which specific blows to the victim’s body and face, the testimony made it clear that defendant was a participant in a community of unlawful purpose at the time the act was committed. and the trial justice did not err giving an aiding-and-abetting instruction to the jury.

        Mere presence at the scene of a crime, in and of itself, is insufficient to warrant a conviction as an aider or abettor, but it is a factor that must form part of a court’s determination of the guilt of the defendant. State v. Gazerro,

        The common law crime of conspiracy involves a combination of two or more persons to commit some unlawful act or do some lawful act for an unlawful purpose; it does not require that any overt acts have been committted in execution of the unlawful agreement. State v. LaPlume,
        <cite class="ocri">

        (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since this section now prescribes a specific punishment for the common-law crime of conspiracy, the applicability of § 11-1-1 to conspiracy prosecutions has been impliedly repealed. State v. Macarelli,
        <cite class="ocri">
         118 R.I. 693

        The rule is well established, sound, and viable that where several persons combine or conspire to commit an unlawful act, each is criminally responsible for the acts of his associates or confederates in the furtherance of any prosecution of the common design for which they combine. Each is responsible for everything done by one or all of his confederates, in the execution of the common design, as one of its probable and natural consequences, even though the act was not a part of the original design or plan, or was even forbidden by one or more of them. State v. Barton,

       </p>
       <p>
        It is totally immaterial that the unlawful agreement be successfully or substantially carried out because once the agreement is made, the offense of conspiracy is complete. State v. Barton,
        <cite class="ocri">
         427 A.2d 1311

        Under this section, the agreement itself constitutes the crime, and the conspiracy is committed at the moment the agreement is struck. It is immaterial whether the conspiracy agreement succeeds or fails. State v. LaRoche,

        Where witness against defendant on trial for conspiracy to murder was not an indicted conspirator and where he testified to acts and to the declaration of defendant himself which were used solely against defendant at his own trial, witness’ testimony was admissible. State v. LaPlume,

        Although the defendant was found not guilty of murder, evidence of the murder was properly admitted at the defendant’s conspiracy trial since the evidence was offered only to show some motive or plan in connection with the conspiracy. State v. Hewes,

        Where defendant was convicted of conspiracy to commit robbery in the lower court, but the only evidence which linked defendant with the man who attempted the robbery was that he was seen to leave in a car with the robber before the crime was committed and was seen to return afterward, the inference of conspiracy was too speculative to support a conviction. State v. Distante,

        Trial court properly denied defendant’s motion for acquittal on charge of conspiracy to statutorily burn where record established that codefendant and defendant had met on various occasions at which they discussed the burning of codefendant’s warehouse, that defendant agreed to slow down the fire department’s response to the fire in order to enable the warehouse to burn, to point out the broken door hasp (which would indicate a forced entry), and to keep codefendant informed of any investigations, and that codefendant set the date of the fire after determining from defendant the nights on which he would be working as battalion commander at the fire department.

        Because there was eyewitness testimony from the homeowner who saw three men removing items from his home and placing them in a car, the trial court was clearly justified in finding the State’s witnesses to be credible and in rejecting defendant’s motion for a new trial in regard to defendant’s convictions for breaking and entering a dwelling and conspiracy. State v. Becote,

        Trial justice properly denied defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal on the charge of conspiracy because there was more than sufficient evidence for a jury to find that defendant and another man were engaged in a conspiracy to murder the victim. The evidence included: (1) defendant’s testimony that defendant and the other man drove together in the other man’s car to the motel where the victim was shot immediately before the shooting; (2) defendant’s friends and cell mate testified that defendant said that the other man hired defendant to do the job; and (3) a rough diagram of the motel where the shooting occurred was found in the other man’s car.

        Because defendant participated in a coordinated attack on a defenseless man that began with an ambush of the victim’s vehicle and ended with a robbery and severe beating, based on the totality of the evidence, the jury reasonably could conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant entered into an agreement with others to commit the crime of robbery.

        Defendant’s convictions of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, possession of one ounce to one kilo of a controlled substance, and conspiracy to violate Rhode Island’s Uniform Controlled Substances Act, R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 21, ch. 28, were vacated. As the evidence was insufficient to prove he knew of and intended to exercise control over cocaine found in his passengers’ purses, the evidence did not support the inference that he agreed with them to traffic in drugs.

        Juvenile was properly adjudicated delinquent for conspiracy to commit robbery because (1) the State produced sufficient evidence of the crime’s corpus delicti to permit admission of the juvenile’s confession through reports of the robbery, apprehension of the juvenile and another nearby within 30 minutes of the reports, the other’s BB gun and cash when arrested, and the juvenile’s footprints leading to another gun, gloves, and a ski mask about 20 feet from where he was arrested, and (2) the confession and other circumstantial evidence proved the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.

        Trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying a defendant’s motion to reduce sentence because the two and one-half year difference between his sentence for breaking and entering and his co-hort’s sentence was not disproportionate as they did not have to receive equal sentences and their were departure factors applicable to the defendant, which the trial justice justified in his findings such as the defendant being a career criminal, the crime turned into one of violence, he lacked remorse, and he had lied on the stand. Further, the trial court did not err by ordering the sentences for the breaking and entering, consipracy to commit breaking and entering, simple assault, and driving a motor vehicle without the permission of the owner to run consecutively rather than concurrently since the trial court justified its order by finding that it was not just a run-of-the-mill breaking and entering, the lives of the victims were changed forever, the defendant had no remorse for the crimes, and took no personal responsibility for his actions.

      Any husband or father who without just cause deserts his wife or minor child by going into another state, and leaves them or any or either of them without making reasonable provisions for their support, shall be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000), or by imprisonment for not more than five (5) years, or both. No civil proceeding in any court shall be held to be a bar to a prosecution pursuant to this section for desertion or nonsupport. In a prosecution pursuant to this section for desertion or nonsupport against a husband, a decree or judgment of any court in a proceeding in which the husband appeared or was personally served with process, establishing the right of the wife to live apart, or her freedom to convey and deal with her property, or the right to the custody of the children, shall be admissible and shall be prima facie evidence of that right.

     <p>
      Any person who knowingly causes, procures, aids, counsels or creates by means of fire or explosion a substantial risk of serious physical harm to any person or damage to any building the property of that person or another, whether or not used for residential purposes, which is occupied or in use for any purpose or which has been occupied or in use for any purpose during the six (6) months preceding the offense or to any other residential structure, shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than five (5) years and may be imprisoned for life, or shall be fined not less than three thousand dollars ($3,000) nor more than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000), or both; provided, further, that whenever a death occurs to a person as a direct result of the fire or explosion or to a person who is directly involved in fighting the fire or explosion, imprisonment shall be for not less than twenty (20) years. In all such cases, the justice may only impose a sentence less than the minimum if he or she finds that substantial and compelling circumstances exist which justify imposition of the alternative sentence. That finding may be based upon the character and background of the defendant, the cooperation of the defendant with law enforcement authorities, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and/or the nature and quality of the evidence presented at trial. If a sentence which is less than imprisonment for the minimum term is imposed, the trial justice shall set forth on the record the circumstances which he or she found as justification for imposition of the lesser sentence.

        The term “any person” in this section defies the exclusion of any class of persons, and the legislature made a conscious choice that if a firefighter were, in fact, placed in substantial risk of serious harm as the result of an intentionally set fire, first-degree arson is the appropriate crime.

        Trial justice did not abuse his discretion in allowing testimony regarding the theft of a medical-treatment card which belonged to the owner of the building burned and was found in the car owned by defendant’s girlfriend. State v. Gordon,

        Defendant is entitled to a new trial, but not a judgment of acquittal, where the trial justice, after independently assessing the evidence in light of his jury charge, determines that the state has failed to prove that the defendant knowingly caused the fire. State v. Dame,
        <cite class="ocri">
         560 A.2d 330

       <p>
        Trial justice did not err in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial after he was convicted of first-degree arson because the trial justice concluded that the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant willfully set fire to the building where his business was located; credible evidence suggested that the business was not as successful a venture as defendant described, an eyewitness saw defendant at the business on the night of the fire, and burns were found on defendant’s legs. The trial justice acted well within her discretion to reject as incredible defendant’s testimony as to how he got burned, why he was driving in the middle of a snowstorm, and how his fanny pack was stolen.

        The term “during the six (6) months preceding the offense” in this section does not require a continuous occupancy throughout the entire six-month period; rather, any point during the six-month period suffices. State v. Caprio,

       <p>
        Sentence of 50 years for first-degree arson and 10 years for conspiracy to commit arson, after the trial justice had rejected the state’s recommendation of a 25-year sentence, was not an abuse of discretion, where the justice weighed relevant factors against the disastrous consequences inflicted upon the victims of the crime. State v. Gordon,
        <cite class="ocri">
         539 A.2d 528

       <p>
        Sentence of 30 years, 20 years to serve, after the state had recommended 30 years, 15 to serve, was within the statutory limits for the offense. State v. Marini,
        <cite class="ocri">
         638 A.2d 507
        </cite>
        ,

       <p>
        Because defendant’s 20-year sentence for first-degree arson was authorized by R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-4-2, it was not an illegal sentence; therefore, defendant’s R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35 motion was properly denied. State v. Tapia,

        Mere presence at the scene of the crime, in and of itself, is insufficient to warrant a conviction, but where there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could reasonably infer that the defendant was posted at the front of the property for the specific purpose of aiding and abetting the codefendants “in any way should the necessity arise,” the trial justice did not commit error in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial.

        Where the state charges the defendant with two counts of assault with intent to murder in violation of this section, which requires only that the intent to murder be accompanied by some type of assault, and it is undisputed that the defendant effectuated the assault with a gun, the court acts correctly when it instructs the jury on the lesser-included offense of assault with a dangerous weapon.

        Where, in each of three incidents, defendant drove up to women who were walking on the street and convinced them to get into his car, then either successfully forced them to perform fellatio or attempted to force them to perform fellatio, and used a firearm in two incidents, the offenses were properly consolidated pursuant to R.I.

       <p>
        Although evidence of prior criminal conduct is generally inadmissible for lack of relevance, an exception to the rule occurs where such evidence tends to establish guilty knowledge, intent, motive, design, plan, scheme, system or the like, and evidence of the theft of a starter’s pistol 20 minutes prior to an alleged assault with intent to rob where the victim testified having seen the gun barrel of a small black handgun being held by the assailant falls within the exception as tending to establish a plan, even though the events described are dissimilar.

        Double jeopardy was found in a particular case where, in order to prove both extortion and assault with intent to rob, the state had to demonstrate the identical elements of an intentional threat to the victim that placed him in fear of actual bodily harm, the purpose of which was to force him to give the defendant money, and proof of no additional fact was required to establish both crimes.

        In a case resulting in defendant’s conviction for domestic assault with a dangerous weapon based on her assault of her half-sister with a knife, where defendant claimed self-defense, the trial justice did not err in excluding Facebook videos illustrating the victim’s acts of violence because the trial justice determined that the videos were cumulative to the victim’s testimony, would inflame the passion of the jurors, and would cause confusion as to what the ultimate issue in the case was.

        In a case resulting in defendant’s conviction for domestic assault with a dangerous weapon based on her assault of her half-sister with a knife, the trial justice provided adequate grounds to support the decision to grant the State’s motion in limine to prevent defendant from mentioning that the victim had been arrested on gun charges; the charges were eventually dismissed as to the victim and use of a gun was not in issue in the current case.

        Conviction for felony assault under R.I. Gen.

        Defendant’s motions for a new trial and for a judgment of acquittal were properly denied as the totality of the evidence of a brutal assault, including the multiple blows to the victim’s head, the resultant bleeding and bruised raccoon eyes, her elevated vital signs, combined with the classification of the victim as critical upon her arrival at the hospital and the hospital’s response to the injuries as life-threatening, was sufficient evidence of a substantial risk of death for R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-5-2 purposes; indeed, the risk of death was considered substantial enough that the hospital’s medical staff contacted the victim’s family, and the readily apparent signs of the victim’s injuries were indicative of a variety of life-threatening conditions, such as a skull fracture, brain bleed, spine injury, and the risk of cardiac arrest.

       <p>
        Because a witness’s testimony was bordering on farfetched and so inconsistent with testimony given by the other witnesses, the trial justice was not clearly wrong in his evaluation of the evidence; the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence was consistent with guilt because defendant held the victim to restrain her and prevent her from protecting her husband while he was being assaulted by defendant’s employees, at a location defendant selected, and made no effort to stop them.

        Trial court properly omitted a jury instruction on self-defense where there was not a scintilla of evidence that entitled defendant to such an instruction, and defendant’s self-defense hypotheses was distinct from the criminal charge she was facing and would not have been legally sufficient to avoid a conviction for assault with a dangerous weapon, thus, confusing the jury.

        Where the evidence that defendant sought to present upon any reopening of a non-jury criminal trial for felony assault with a dangerous weapon and malicious destruction of property could not be considered “newly discovered” and merely presented a question of credibility, the trial justice’s denial of a new trial pursuant to to R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 33 was correct; defendant failed to set forth the particular grounds upon which defendant sought the relief requested in compliance with R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 47.

       <p>
        Defendant’s conviction for assault with a dangerous weapon, after he struck two victims in the back with a broken bottle, was supported by sufficient evidence where the court considered defendant’s motion for new trial and properly reviewed the testimony, addressed the credibility of each witness, and considered the evidence in the light of the jury’s charge and found the elements of assault with a dangerous weapon were satisfied.

       <p>
        Denial of motion for a new trial on charges of violating R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-5-2 was not an abuse of discretion. The trial justice articulated adequate reasoning by noting discrepancies in the witnesses’ testimony, understanding material and relevant evidence, and correctly choosing which testimony to accept and reject; the justice appropriately determined that the evidence could cause reasonable minds to differ as to the outcome of the case.

        Defendant was not entitled to a new trial as to a felony assault conviction because the trial justice (1) agreed with the jury’s verdict and (2) considered factors used to find the credibility of eyewitness testimony. State v. Lopez,

        Superior court properly denied defendant’s motion for a new trial because the trial justice articulated adequate grounds for denying the motion, carefully reviewed the testimony, and weighed the evidence before him, he specifically noted the shortcomings and inconsistencies of certain witnesses, but ultimately concluded, based on his own credibility determinations, that the weight of the evidence supported guilty verdicts as to the counts of assault with a dangerous weapon and malicious injury to property, and determined that he would have reached the same conclusion as the jury—that defendant cut the victim with a machete and broke the car and basement windows with the machete.

        The state, by proving the elements of the crime of kidnapping, does not automatically prove the crime of assault with a dangerous weapon used in the kidnapping; therefore, the offenses do not merge under the double-jeopardy clause. State v. Ballard,

        There is nothing inconsistent with finding a defendant guilty of both assault with a dangerous weapon and burglary, and acquitting him of assault with intent to commit murder, where the jury finds an entry with the intent to commit a felony and assault with a dangerous weapon.

        The term “accident” in § 31-26-1 (leaving the scene of an accident) includes all collisions, intentional as well as unintentional. Therefore, a defendant can be found guilty of both the intentional act of assault and the act of leaving the scene of an accident, since each crime requires proof of a separate element distinct from the other.

        The jury could properly infer that the defendant had the present ability to carry out his threat since, even though the weapon was not recovered, two witnesses testified that they saw and heard the defendant shoot a gun as he leapt from a vehicle and that, moments later, the defendant pointed the weapon at one of the witnesses while he was fleeing from the murder scene.

        Evidence supported a trial justice’s finding that, after a brawl had subsided and the individuals involved were leaving, defendant, who had been a participant in the brawl, ran back and landed a punch to the head of the victim. The trial justice did not find any credible evidence that supported defendant’s claim of self-defense, and, based on the testimony of witnesses and the events depicted in a surveillance video, determined that the initial confrontation had concluded before defendant punched the victim.

        Total sentence of 45 years, with 30 years to serve and the remaining 15 years suspended, was proper for assault convictions, and denial of defendant’s R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35(a) motion to reduce his sentence was proper, because, inter alia, the penalty for felony assault under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-5-2(a) was imprisonment for not more than 20 years, and a 15-year sentence for each of these counts was not statutorily infirm; the trial justice articulated numerous reasons for giving defendant a stiff punishment including the viciousness of the crimes, defendant’s criminal record, his refusal to take responsibility or show remorse, his efforts to control the behavior of his child’s mother, and the fact that the commission of the crime was by ambush. Further, the trial justice’s exhaustive explanation justified the consecutive terms. State v. Snell,

        Trial court erred in limiting defendant in defendant’s felony assault case from cross-examining a man, the accusing witness, other than as to the single question about whether the man planned to civilly sue defendant. As a result of the limitation, defendant was not permitted to fully confront the man about the man’s bias toward defendant and potential need to exaggerate the man’s injuries after the man stated that the man did indeed intend to civilly sue defendant.

        R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-5-2 focuses on the conduct of a defendant and whether his or her assault upon another results in serious bodily injury, that is, results in a physical injury that creates a substantial risk of death under § 11-5-2(a) and 11-5-2(c)(1); the statute does not require that the victim of the assault be rendered objectively or clinically at risk of death but frames the issue as whether the conduct of a defendant, in assaulting the victim, creates a substantial risk of death under § 11-5-2(c)(1).

        Evidence that defendant committed an assault with a dangerous weapon was insufficient to support conviction, and motion for acquittal should have been granted, where the alleged victim’s identification of the object brandished by defendant as a gun was equivocal at best; this was an insufficient basis for drawing an inference that an alleged weapon was operable.

       <p>
        An automobile in and of itself is not considered a dangerous weapon, but it may become so if it is employed in such a manner to render it capable of inflicting death or serious bodily injury. State v. Mercier,
        <cite class="ocri">
         415 A.2d 465
        </cite>
        ,
        <cite class="ocri">
         1980 R.I. LEXIS 1677

        (R.I. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        There may be a conviction of assault with a dangerous weapon when the object used in the assault is not per se a dangerous weapon if it appears that the object was used in such a way that it had the capability of producing serious bodily harm. The test is not whether serious bodily harm results, rather it is whether the object was so used that serious bodily harm may have resulted. State v. Mercier,
        <cite class="ocri">
         415 A.2d 465
        </cite>
        ,
        <cite class="ocri">

        (R.I. 1980).

       <p>
        Defendant was properly convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon when defendant wrapped a boot cord around a paramour’s neck and tightened it because the cord, while not inherently dangerous, was capable of producing serious injury or death and whether the crime of assault with a dangerous weapon was committed did not turn on the nature and extent of the victim’s injuries, but whether the instrumentality was used in such a way that it could produce serious bodily injury.

        The Supreme Court of Rhode Island has defined “battery” as an act that is intended to cause, and does cause, an offensive contact with, an unconsented touching of, or trauma upon the body of another, thereby generally resulting in the consummation of an assault. Aside from the obvious higher standard of proof required to establish criminal battery, the law recognizes no distinction between criminal and civil battery. Fenwick v. Oberman,

        In a prosecution for domestic simple assault, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the prosecutor to impeach defendant with seven prior convictions, two of which involved assaultive behavior, because the similarity between the charged offense and the prior convictions did not preclude admission of those convictions.

        In a prosecution for domestic simple assault, the victim’s testimony that defendant had been drinking at the time of the incident did not obligate the trial court to pass the case, as the comment was not sufficiently prejudicial as to prevent the jury from dispassionately considering the evidence, and there was no indication that it failed to obey the trial court’s instruction to disregard the victim’s statement.

        In light of the reference to R.I. Gen.

        Defendant’s contention that he was placed twice in jeopardy by being prosecuted for extortion pursuant to § 11-42-2 subsequent to a conviction for assault and battery pursuant to this section was without merit, since assault and battery, which is the intentional and unlawful application of the slightest force to the person of another, and extortion, which consists of a verbal threat to place a victim in peril of actual bodily harm accompanied by an intent to compel that victim to do an act against his will, require proof of different elements and hence do not satisfy the “same evidence” test applied by the court.

        In a probation violation hearing relating to a charge that defendant committed assault or battery while he was on probation, the hearing justice did not err in deciding to credit the testimony of the State’s witnesses rather than the testimony of defendant’s witnesses, in that it was reasonable for the hearing justice to give a lesser weight to the testimony of an eyewitness, who admitted that he had poor eyesight and who denied ever seeing defendant, from his vantage point across the street, strike the complaining witness.

        In a domestic assault prosecution, defendant’s wife recanted her statements to police that he hit and kicked her son and tried to slap the phone out of her hand to prevent her from calling police.

        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of simple assault or battery because the lieutenant testified that defendant jumped out of his car and on top of him, which sufficed to satisfy the element of an offensive touching upon another’s body. State v. Edwards,

       <p>
        Because a witness’s testimony was bordering on farfetched and so inconsistent with testimony given by the other witnesses, the trial justice was not clearly wrong in his evaluation of the evidence; the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence was consistent with guilt because defendant held the victim to restrain her and prevent her from protecting her husband while he was being assaulted by defendant’s employees, at a location defendant selected, and made no effort to stop them. State v. Parrillo,

        Defendant was not entitled to a new trial on the assault with a dangerous weapon count, as he was the only person in the house to assault the victim, he was there when she woke up stabbed and bleeding, and there was evidence of defendant’s intent to murder the victim, including the severity of the victim’s wounds, which included a stab wound to her chest, ligature marks, a collapsed lung, and bleeding in her brain. State v. Grantley,
        <cite class="ocri">
         149 A.3d 124
        </cite>
        ,

       </p>
       <p>
        Although the victim did not identify defendant in an initial photo array, her identification of defendant was sufficient because a Facebook search by her of a name provided by the Attorney General’s office yielded profiles and photos that she scrolled through before seeing one with a familiar face that was defendant. Moreover, at trial, the victim emphasized that her in-court identification of defendant was based on his height, how big he was, and his eyes. State v. Johnson,
        <cite class="ocri">
         199 A.3d 1046
        </cite>
        ,

       </p>
       <p>
        Victim’s testimony as to the actions and statements of defendant and his accomplices led to a reasonable inference that the gun used in a robbery was operable; the victim testified that she was in fear—as demonstrated by her question to an accomplice about whether he thought the others involved in the robbery were going to kill her, defendant threatened to return if she called the police, and the gun was pointed at her for the duration of the incident.

        Crimes of criminal contempt and assault of a police officer, R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-5-5, constitute separate crimes with different elements for each because only contempt requires an attack on the dignity of the court, and a conviction under § 11-5-5 requires proof of an unlawful striking of a uniformed officer. Therefore, even where contempt and the assault charges arise out of the same incident, each offense requires proof of a fact that the other does not. State v. Grayhurst,

        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of felony assault of a police officer because a lieutenant testified that when he asked for a license, registration, and proof of insurance, defendant swore at him; defendant exited the vehicle, and jumped on top of the lieutenant; when the second officer walked around the car, a scuffle occurred, leading defendant to eventually bite the second officer in three different areas; and the trial justice reviewed hospital records and photographs evidencing those bite marks, which he referred to as showing unquestionable injury.

        In defendant’s trial for assault and battery upon a person over the age of sixty, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-5-10, for causing the victim to fall against a granite marker, defendant’s proffer of a model of the granite marker was properly denied because: (1) the model was made of a different substance than the marker, (2) the model was of a different shape than the marker, and (3) the trial justice properly considered the model’s physical appearance, compared the model to a photograph of the marker, and assessed the model’s prejudicial nature.

        When defendant was prosecuted for assault and battery upon a person over the age of sixty, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-5-10, defendant’s proffer of testimony about other incidents between defendant and the victim was properly rejected because such evidence attempted to do what

        It is elementary that the offense of burglary does not necessarily include stealing or theft either at common law or by the statutes. C. &amp; G. Mfg. Co. v. Columbia Ins. Co.,
        <cite class="ocri">
         89 R.I. 62

        The burglary statute incorporates the common-law definition of that crime which has been defined as “breaking and entering the dwelling house of another in the nighttime with the intent to commit a felony therein, whether the felony be actually committed or not”. State v. O'Rourke,
        <cite class="ocri">

        Where defendant in the nighttime broke into apartment which was used as a dwelling and from inside the apartment partially broke through a wall into an adjoining drugstore, there could be no conviction for burglary since there was no intent to commit a felony “therein” since the intent was to commit the felony in the drugstore. State v. O'Rourke,
        <cite class="ocri">
         121 R.I. 434

       </p>
       <p>
        For purposes of determining whether a burglary took place during the nighttime, the burglary is considered complete at the time the breaking and entering took place with felonious intent, and not at the later point in time when the defendant encountered the victim. State v. Lefebvre,
        <cite class="ocri">
         609 A.2d 957
        </cite>
        ,
        <cite class="ocri">
         1992 R.I. LEXIS 153
        </cite>
        (R.I. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The word “breaking” in the definition of burglary is used in a technical rather than popular sense, so that there is a breaking if the intruder, by the use of force no matter how slight, removes an obstacle which if left untouched would prevent entrance. Accordingly, the trial justice properly denied the defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal with respect to a burglary charge where the trier of fact may properly have concluded that the defendant had gained entrance to the victim’s apartment by the opening or removal of the screen to a bedroom window, which, if left as found, would have prevented the entering. State v. Simpson,
        <cite class="ocri">
         611 A.2d 1390
        </cite>
        ,
        <cite class="ocri">
         1992 R.I. LEXIS 135
        </cite>
        (R.I. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The defendant had to open the screen door before the defendant could knock either on the front door or attack the poor victim. That opening action was enough to constitute a breaking. State v. Charette,
        <cite class="ocri">
         688 A.2d 1286
        </cite>
        ,
        <cite class="ocri">
         1997 R.I. LEXIS 6
        </cite>
        (R.I. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        The victim’s bedroom was a “dwelling” within the meaning of the law of burglary since the room had a lock on the doorknob and an additional dead-bolt lock and thus was entitled to the same level of security and protection as that afforded a dormitory room or a private apartment within a bed-and-breakfast. State v. Contreras-Cruz,
        <cite class="ocri">
         765 A.2d 849
        </cite>
        ,

        There is nothing inconsistent with finding a defendant guilty of both assault with a dangerous weapon and burglary, and acquitting him of assault with intent to commit murder, where the jury finds an entry with the intent to commit a felony and assault with a dangerous weapon.

        Defendant was entitled to a new trial where defense counsel’s representation was so wanting in all respects as to amount to a complete absence of a defense in that she neglected to move for a judgment of acquittal on the offense of burglary in spite of the fact that the record was devoid of any evidence that the defendant entered a dwelling with the specific intent to commit a felony therein, and that she failed to request discovery from the prosecution, to submit a request to charge any lesser-included offenses, to present any defense based upon the defendant’s intoxication, and to file a motion for a new trial prior to the expiration of the appropriate limitation period.

        A conviction of burglary was upheld since there was no evidence that the defendant had asked permission to enter the victim’s bedroom, knocked on the door, or attempted to wake her, but rather the record reflected that the victim in no way gave her consent but instead woke to find the defendant having sexual intercourse with her.

        The distinguishing element between a criminal trespass and breaking and entering is the element of a “break”. State v. Turner,
        <cite class="ocri">
         655 A.2d 693
        </cite>
        ,

        (R.I. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because there was eyewitness testimony from the homeowner who saw three men removing items from his home and placing them in a car, the trial court was clearly justified in finding the State’s witnesses to be credible and in rejecting defendant’s motion for a new trial in regard to defendant’s convictions for breaking and entering a dwelling and conspiracy. State v. Becote,
        <cite class="ocri">
         864 A.2d 598

       </p>
       <p>
        State did not have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed breaking and entering in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-8-2 to show that defendant violated his probation where defendant was arrested on that charge while on probation for breaking and entering. Rather, the presiding judicial officer only had to be “reasonably satisfied” that defendant breached a condition of probation by failing to keep the peace or remain on good behavior, and that showing was made in defendant’s case. State v. Bouffard,
        <cite class="ocri">
         945 A.2d 305
        </cite>

       <p>
        State introduced sufficient evidence to revoke defendant’s probation, which had been granted to defendant on nine years of defendant’s 10-year sentence for breaking and entering in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-8-2. The evidence showed that defendant failed to remain on good behavior when, while on probation, defendant confronted a group, sought a fight, and threw rocks that struck a witness. Also, defendant could not challenge the original sentence as being illegal pursuant to R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35 because defendant did not challenge the original sentence within 120 days of that sentence being imposed. State v. Christodal,
        <cite class="ocri">
         946 A.2d 811
        </cite>

       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying a defendant’s motion to reduce sentence because the two and one-half year difference between his sentence for breaking and entering and his co-hort’s sentence was not disproportionate as they did not have to receive equal sentences and their were departure factors applicable to the defendant, which the trial justice justified in his findings such as the defendant being a career criminal, the crime turned into one of violence, he lacked remorse, and he had lied on the stand. Further, the trial court did not err by ordering the sentences for the breaking and entering, consipracy to commit breaking and entering, simple assault, and driving a motor vehicle without the permission of the owner to run consecutively rather than concurrently since the trial court justified its order by finding that it was not just a run-of-the-mill breaking and entering, the lives of the victims were changed forever, the defendant had no remorse for the crimes, and took no personal responsibility for his actions.

        An indictment which charged the defendant with entering an apartment intending to commit larceny was quashed for failure to charge an offense under former § 11-8-3 as the terms “apartment” and “dwelling house” were used with specificity by the legislature in originally drafting §§ 11-8-2 and 11-8-3 as a single statute, and the legislature thus distinguished the terms by using them in contrasting ways.

        Trial justice properly denied defendant’s motion for a new trial with respect to the breaking and entering count, as the three witnesses who lived at the house testified that defendant did not have permission to be there, defendant had his own apartment and did not have keys to the victim’s home, and the victim was deemed to be a credible witness.

        The defendant, who walked through an already open door to enter a dwelling, was entitled to a judgment of acquittal since the record was devoid of any evidence that the defendant exerted force to effectuate a break-in. State v. Beeley,

        Because the lack of a criminal intent requirement places the offense of unlawful breaking and entering of a dwelling house outside the realm of a violent felony, the defendant’s conviction under this section did not qualify as a burglary for purposes of federal career criminal sentencing laws.

        Although R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-8-3 was broader than a generic burglary statute, defendant’s violation of § 11-8-3 constituted a crime of violence under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual §§ 4B1.1(a) and 4B1.2(a)(2) because defendant’s admission during his plea colloquy that he entered a victim’s dwelling with intent to commit larceny and without the victim’s consent showed that defendant committed a burglary as defined in § 4B1.2(a)(2). Thus, defendant’s § 11-8-3 conviction was properly taken into account in classifying defendant as a career offender under § 4B1.1(a). United States v. Major,

        Although a jury found defendant guilty of entering a building with the intent to commit larceny, R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-8-3, but not guilty of larceny in excess of $ 500, R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-41-1, the verdicts were not inconsistent because even though an employee saw defendant carrying something out of a business, which was closed for a holiday, and two laptops were missing from the business, the jury could have found defendant not guilty on the actual physical possession or larceny of the item because defendant was not found with the laptops in his possession.

        Trial justice did not err in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial after a jury found defendant guilty of entering a building with the intent to commit larceny, in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-8-3, because there was sufficient circumstantial evidence that defendant entered a construction business with the requisite intent to commit some kind of larceny; an employee saw defendant carrying something out of the building, when the business was closed for a holiday, and the employee then discovered two laptops were missing from the business.

        There was no error in refusing to instruct the jury to acquit defendant if they found that at the time he broke and entered a cafe he was too intoxicated to form the necessary criminal intent, where the only evidence on such defense was that he had, prior to closing of the cafe, ordered one drink, most of which the proprietor had poured out because he had failed on demand to finish it before closing time.

        Where the possession-of-burglary-tools count of an indictment charged that the defendant possessed implements designed and adapted for entering a building “in order to commit the crime of burglary” the trial court erred when, in its instructions to the jury, it paraphrased the indictment and substituted for the statutory langauge “in order to commit a crime,” thus inserting in place of the specific intent element of burglary, a general-intent element.

        There was sufficient evidence to support a verdict of guilty on the charge of possession of burglary tools when the evidence showed that the defendant was sitting in the passenger seat of the car used by the burglars, that there were several burglary tools around the seat, and that the defendant severed the telephone wires of the burglarized home.

        As in the defense of self-defense, the plea of justification in defense of a third person, if raised by defendant must be negated by the state beyond a reasonable doubt, provided the defense is supported by sufficient evidence to raise a factual issue. State v. Caron,

        Due process requires that the jury must receive clear instructions that the prosecution must persuade them beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was not in self-defense once the defendant produces evidence of self-defense. State v. Caron,

        During defendant’s trial on a charge of second-degree murder, a trial court did not err by refusing defendant’s requested instruction for the presumption of reasonable means of self-defense under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-8-8 because the statute was triggered by evidence of a breaking and entering and the victim entered through an unblocked, open door; there was no evidence the victim struck defendant to enter the house by removing an obstruction.

        In a case in which defendant was convicted of possession of child pornography, probable cause did not exist for a warrant because the detective’s affidavit described a display of nudity in a public place, but it did not indicate that there was a lascivious exhibition of the depicted child’s genitals or pubic area; it did not aver that the genitals or pubic area were the focal points; the described setting (a beach) was not particularly sexually suggestive; there was no indication that the image suggested sexual coyness, a willingness to engage in sexual activity, or that the image was intended or designed to elicit a sexual response; and the title of the file was not on its face suggestive of child pornography.

        Evidence of the defendant’s prior shoplifting and breaking into apartments and the relation that this criminal activity bore to her compulsion to obtain cocaine was relevant to the issue of whether she possessed the requisite intent to commit the crime of wrongfully permitting her child to be a habitual sufferer and was therefore properly admitted. State v. Stewart,

        Evidence of the defendant’s attempt to return unused baby formula to a grocery store after the death of her child by dehydration, and her subsequently spending $20.00 given her by the store manager to purchase cocaine, tended to show the ruthless determination on her part to obtain cocaine in any circumstances and was probative of her intent to permit her son to be a habitual sufferer for want of the food and proper care that was essential for his survival, and was therefore admissible.

        The defendant’s repeated voluntary and intentional ingestion of crack cocaine while her seven-week-old son, who eventually died from dehydration, was in her care, in addition to her testimony that she knew that she was incapable of properly caring for her children during these extended periods of cocaine intoxication, supported a finding that she intentionally permitted her son to be a habitual sufferer for want of food and proper care. There is a distinction between “intentionally depriving” a child of food and proper care, and “intentionally permitting” a child to be a habitual sufferer for want of food or proper care. State v.

        By imposing criminal liability for wrongful conduct rather than for intentional conduct, the legislature expressed an intent that this section could be violated even absent a conscious purpose to cause or permit a child to be a habitual sufferer, as long as no legal justification or legal excuse existed. Thus, this section can be violated by an unintentional omission to act by one who has a duty to act, as well as by active conduct. State v. Stewart,

        In a prosecution for second-degree felony murder, rather than determine if the crime of wrongfully permitting a child to be a habitual sufferer, the predicate felony underlying the felony-murder charge, was inherently dangerous in the abstract, the state had the opportunity to prove at trial that the crime was inherently dangerous in the manner that it was committed.

        Trial justice committed clear error by sua sponte dismissing a criminal information against defendant as defendant did not file a motion to dismiss, and the trial court failed to follow the procedural rules applicable to dismissals. By prohibiting the Attorney General from fully prosecuting the felony information in violation of R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 9.1, the trial justice clearly erred and deprived the State of a fair proceeding. State v. Strom,

        New trial was required because there was nothing in the record demonstrating that the trial justice was assured by defendant that her waiver of a jury trial was made intelligently and with full knowledge of the consequences of her waiver; defendant was charged with cruelty to or neglect of a child, a felony offense, and therefore she was constitutionally guaranteed a jury trial, absent a determination by the trial justice that she knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived that right.

        Although a child abuse felony complaint under R.I. Gen.

Gen. Laws § 11-9-9 divested the family court of jurisdiction. State v. Jennings,

        Conviction for first-degree child abuse was supported by sufficient evidence where the child was walking, talking, and functioning when the child’s mother left the child with defendant and the evidence presented at trial permitted a reasonable juror to conclude that the child was in defendant’s exclusive care all day, that the injury occurred when defendant was caring for the child, and that it was defendant who caused the nonaccidental head trauma.

        R.I. Gen.

        In convicting defendant, the victim’s half-brother, of second-degree child abuse under subsection (b)(2) of this section (“any other physical injury”), the trial justice did not need to reach the question of a lesser-included offense (simple assault) because the trial justice determined that the elements of the statute had been met; the trial justice clearly articulated a basis for his finding that the injury requirement had been met, relying on credible witness testimony from the victim, her sister, and her mother, in addition to the medical records and photographs of the victim’s injury.

        Because a felony prosecution commences only after a charge by information, the prosecution for violating R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-9-5.3 was not pending as of the 2006 amendment of R.I. Gen.

       <p>
        Although a child abuse felony complaint under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-9-5.3(e) was filed against defendant in Family Court in June 2006, it was merely an initial bail-setting instrument, and since the information charging defendant and formally commencing the prosecution was not filed until November 2006, the July 2006 amendment to R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-9-9 divested the Family Court of jurisdiction. State v. Jennings,
        <cite class="ocri">
         944 A.2d 171

       </p>
       <p>
        Because a felony prosecution commences only after a charge by information, the prosecution for violating R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-9-5.3 was not pending as of the 2006 amendment of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-9-9 because the state had not filed the information until more than three months after the amendment removed jurisdiction to the Superior Court. The Family Court properly dismissed the prosecution for lack of jurisdiction. State v. Machado,

         944 A.2d 865

       Legislative intent — Purpose.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The use of tobacco by Rhode Island children is a health and substance abuse problem of the utmost severity. The legislature finds that tobacco product usage by children in Rhode Island is rampant and increasing with over thirty percent (30%) of high school students smoking. The present law prohibiting the sale of tobacco to children is being ignored by many retailers. Rhode Island tobacco retailers illegally sell four million eight hundred thousand (4,800,000) packs, over eleven million dollars ($11,000,000) in tobacco product sales, to children annually. Tobacco industry advertising targets children as the replacement smokers for the one thousand one hundred forty-five (1,145) adults who die daily from tobacco product usage. Approximately seventy percent (70%) of the Rhode Island high school seniors who are smoking today will be the addicted adult smokers of tomorrow. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), smoking-related direct medical costs in Rhode Island in 1990 climbed to one hundred eighty-six million dollars ($186,000,000). This is an ongoing, escalating financial burden borne by every business, large and small, and every person, smoker and nonsmoker, in Rhode Island. This is a health and economic drain created by each new generation of children who begin using tobacco products and become addicted to nicotine. It is the intent of this legislation to preserve and protect the health of children by: (1) stopping the illegal sale of tobacco to children, and (2) by severely punishing those who disregard the laws relating to the illegal sale of tobacco products to children.

        Court rejected defendant’s argument that he could not be constitutionally convicted under this section for fellatio because the statute is so vague and uncertain as to violate his due process rights, reasoning that since the judicial construction in State v. Milne,

        A decision of unmarried adults to engage in private consensual sexual activities is not of such a fundamental nature and is not so implicit in the concept of ordered liberty as to warrant its inclusion in the guarantee of personal privacy. Therefore, the prosecution of an unmarried person for a violation of this section was constitutional. State v. Lopes,

        The court was of the opinion that when the provisions of this section are read in the context of the entire title, the legislative intent becomes obvious that all unnatural sexual copulation was to be made unlawful along with normal extra-marital sexual intercourse. State v. Milne,
        <cite class="ocri">

       <p>
        The Legislature purposely chose the term “crime against nature” to achieve a degree of comprehensiveness that would not have been possible with an enumeration. State v. Santos,
        <cite class="ocri">

        Since the legislative purpose in enacting title 11 was to proscribe all natural copulation that takes place outside of the marriage status, this section in this light necessarily proscribes all unnatural sexual copulation. State v. Santos,

       <p>
        In enacting chapter 37 of title 11, it is clear that the legislature did not intend to pardon any of the activity that is covered under this section. Accordingly, this section retains viability notwithstanding the enactment of the sexual-assault statute in chapter 37 of title 11. State v. Souza,
        <cite class="ocri">
         456 A.2d 775

       <p>
        The offense of an abominable and detestable crime against nature is a lesser included offense of the offense of first-degree sexual assault, where the physical act required to consummate both offenses is identical and the only difference is a material factual dispute concerning whether the acts are consensual in nature or the result of force or coercion. State v. Yates,

        The trial justice did not err in determining that the preservation of abominable and detestable crime against nature charges against the defendant would have been inconsistent with the manifest intention of the legislature to decriminalize sodomy between consenting adults and that such preservation would be repugnant to the statute as amended.

       <p>
        Fellatio is criminal under the provisions of this section and therefore is an indecent act within the purview of the pertinent provisions of § 11-34-5. State v. Milne,

       <p>
        Although both fellatio and cunnilingus are crimes against nature, they are distinct in definition. Fellatio is “the offense committed with the male sexual organ and the mouth.” Cunnilingus is an act of sex perversion committed with the mouth and the female sex organ. State v. McParlin,

        The word sodomy when used in conjunction with the charge of “committing an abominable and detestable crime against nature” is nothing more than surplusage. State v. Castore,
        <cite class="ocri">
         435 A.2d 321

        ,

       <p>
        Where criminal information charged defendant with the commission of “the abominable and detestable crime against nature, sodomy” the term “sodomy” was nothing more than surplusage and need not have been established by the state to obtain a conviction under this section where another “abominable and detestable crime against nature” was proven during the course of the trial. State v. Castore,

        In proving the element of penetration, the state is not required to offer evidence corroborating that of the complainant and the testimony of the complainant was sufficient to sustain defendant’s conviction even though a physician who examined the complainant several weeks after the alleged assault testified he found no evidence of penetration.

       <p>
        Although this section is not by its terms limited to a situation in which the use of profanity rises to the level of fighting words, and is thus capable of an overbroad interpretation encompassing protected speech, the court construed this section to proscribe only fighting words to preserve its constitutional validity. State v. Authelet,
        <cite class="ocri">
         120 R.I. 42

        ,

        (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Profanity can only be constitutionally punished if the penal statute is restricted to the proscription of fighting words. State v. Authelet,
        <cite class="ocri">
         120 R.I. 42
        </cite>
        ,

        Given the commonly understood and established meaning of the word “profane” and its inclusion in criminal statutes by both state and federal legislatures, the use of the term in this section was a sufficient warning to protect defendant’s due process rights. State v. Authelet,

        The test to be applied in determining whether defendant’s profanity amounted to fighting words is whether defendant’s words, when directed to the average person, would cause that person to fight. State v. Authelet,
        <cite class="ocri">

        In a suit brought by plaintiffs alleging a fraudulent scheme involving annuity insurance investments, the federal district court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim as to plaintiffs’ counts alleging civil liability for crimes and offenses under Rhode Island law because under the pleading standard of Fed. R. Civ. P. 8, the court found that the catchall phrase “any writing whatsoever purporting to contain evidence of any debt, contract, or promise” in R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-17-1 arguably encompassed the annuity applications, which contained evidence of a promise. W. Reserve Life Assur. Co. v. Caramadre,

        Under the provisions of the forgery statute, the crime of forgery and the crime of uttering and publishing are separate offenses, since the forger need not be the utterer, the utterer need not be the forger, and neither are even required to be aware of the other. State v. Oliveira,

       <p>
        Where the defendant was charged in the state’s criminal information with only the crime of uttering and publishing four checks, and not with the forging of the checks, the trial justice’s supplemental instruction after a request for clarification from the jury, in which he instructed them that the defendant could be found guilty of forgery, constituted both clear and prejudicial error.

       <p>
        Defendant was not entitled to a new trial on the charge of uttering and publishing, where the trial justice conducted a proper review of the trial proceedings and explained that the trial justice did not believe defendant’s testimony and that the jury was within its domain as fact-finder to credit the state’s witness’ version of events, that defendant knew the check was a forgery when defendant asked the witness to deposit the check in the witness’ bank account.

        Neither this section nor § 11-18-6 relate to the protection of the same interest as does § 19-19-1 because the two misdemeanor statutes are designed to control external transmissions of false information whereas the felony statute is designed to protect the integrity of the internal records of a bank for the protection of its depositors; therefore, neither of the misdemeanors bears the necessary inherent relationship to the felony offense to make it a lesser included offense.

        There was no evidence that a physician reported any false information in preparing a death certificate, in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 11-18-1(a), 23-3-16(c), or 23-4-7, as plaintiff failed to establish that the decedent’s death was caused by any condition not listed on the death certificate and failed to present sufficient evidence showing any “suspicion of accident” or that the death occurred in an “unusual manner” or in any “unnatural manner, or as the apparent result of the negligence of another person.” Malinou v.

        By granting the right to conduct a raffle and/or “20-week club” to political parties whose gubernatorial candidates poll at least five percent of the vote (i.e., in practice and effect, limiting the grant to the Republican and Democratic parties), this section benefits those with popular views, seriously impugns the first amendment rights of minority organizations without necessarily serving the avowed purpose of the regulation — the control of gambling — in a rational way and, thus, does not pass constitutional muster.

        Where grocery association in celebrating its golden anniversary invited the general public and, as an added feature to enhance public interest, made arrangements for a drawing in the nature of a door prize, no consideration being required to participate in the drawing other than to attend as a spectator and fill out a card bearing name and address of individual participating and the association made arrangements to sponsor an air trip as such door prize via an airline paying for such air trip by assuming certain obligations to the airline, there was no consideration within the meaning of this section as far as the winning person was concerned and therefore there was no lottery.

        Evidence justified conviction of knowingly having in possession a slip or paper used in game of policy-lottery, where it was shown that slip in defendant’s possession was a record of drawing. State v. Gaines,
        <cite class="ocri">
         32 R.I. 462
        </cite>

       <p>
        Where defendant was convicted for possession of lottery slips, admission of a slip of paper with the notation “6 days” was sufficient to connect it with carrying on a lottery game on the basis of the testimony of the detective who participated in the raid even if other numbers on the slip were not policy lottery numbers and if there was error in admitting this slip, it was not prejudicial error. State v. Sangermano,
        <cite class="ocri">

         Indictment or Complaint.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The complaint does not need to allege that the possession of the lottery slips was for an unlawful purpose. The statute makes it a criminal offense, subject to the exception specifically provided, for any person knowingly to have lottery slips in his possession whatever the purpose of that possession may be. It is the possession without more which constitutes the offense, and not possession accompanied by an unlawful purpose. State v. Tutalo,
        <cite class="ocri">

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The word “possession” as used in the statute does not require that an accused be the owner of or have a qualified property right in the lottery slips as distinguished from having them in hand. The violation is not concerned with whether the violator was the possessor of a property right in the lottery slips or was the custodian of such slips. State v. Tutalo,
        <cite class="ocri">
         99 R.I. 14

       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that lottery slips found on defendant all related to bets placed on events that had already transpired was no defense to prosecution under this section. State v. Scotti,

       </p>
       <p>
        It is possession without more of a lottery slip which constitutes an offense under this section, and not possession accompanied by an unlawful purpose. State v. Scotti,
        <cite class="ocri">
         104 R.I. 683

       <p>
        In a conviction for possession of lottery slips, the testimony of the detective who participated in the raid was sufficient to establish identification and prove that slips were in substantially the same condition as at the time of the raid so that they could be admitted as evidence.

        Information from reliable informer that defendant was seen in possession of lottery tickets and that he would be at backstretch of the race track that afternoon because his companion, a bookie, carried on his business there did not justify a reasonable inference that at 5 p.m. of that afternoon defendant would have the tickets on his person; accordingly, there was no probable cause for his arrest at that time.

        Where defendant was arrested in a small variety store that he operated and charged with a violation of this section, the finding of a yellow slip of paper with a recorded bet thereon, the presence of a brown paper bag, and the information from an alleged reliable informer that defendant “carried the action and the money in a brown paper bag,” was sufficient to constitute probable cause for defendant’s arrest and to support a conviction for a violation of this section and there was no error in denying a motion for a directed verdict for violation of this section.

        It is a legitimate exercise of police power for the legislature to suppress lotteries and there is a legislative right to prescribe evidentiary rules. In the exercise of that right the legislature may, with limitations, and even in criminal cases, provide that when certain facts have been proved, they shall be prima facie or presumptive evidence of other facts; where the inference is not purely arbitrary and there is a rational relation between the two facts, and the accused is not deprived of a proper opportunity to submit all the facts bearing upon the issue, the statute does not violate the requirements of due process of law.

        Although the defendant owned and operated a cafe where police officers found betting slips, newspapers turned to the racing section, and received a telephone call on a pay telephone in which callers attempted to place a bet, the fact that the defendant’s cafe was a place open to the public did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knowingly kept the cafe as a place designed to be used by persons assembled therein for the purpose of gambling and such evidence was not sufficient for conviction under this section.

       The Rhode Island lottery is empowered to sell and regulate the sale of pull-tab lottery tickets to religious, fraternal, civic, educational, veterans’, or charitable organizations.

As part of such determination, the Rhode Island lottery shall require criminal background checks of the applicant and any individual the lottery deems appropriate and said individuals shall apply to the bureau of criminal investigation of the Rhode Island state police or the Rhode Island department of the attorney general for a national criminal records check with fingerprinting. The individual whose criminal records check is being conducted shall be responsible for the payment of the costs of said criminal records check. The Rhode Island state police or the Rhode Island department of attorney general, as applicable, shall send the results of such criminal check to the Rhode Island lottery. Once said results are sent to and received by the Rhode Island Lottery, the Rhode Island state police and the Rhode Island department of attorney general shall promptly destroy said fingerprint record(s). On or before February 1, 2011, the agency shall adopt rules and regulations establishing criteria to be used in determining whether based upon a criminal records check an application will be approved.

        R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-22-2(3), on its face, operates as an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech because it grants a local official unbridled discretion to approve or deny sign postings on even private property that overlaps with a public highway right of way. As currently constructed, § 11-22-2(3) is not sufficiently narrow and violates the First Amendment, and concomitantly, R.I. Const. art. I, § 21. Driver v. Town of Richmond,

        Where the Rhode Island Supreme Court received more than 40 nearly identical petitions for writ of certiorari seeking review of the superior court’s denial of the respective petitioner’s postconviction relief application, all the petitions for writ of certiorari were denied as the statutes for murder, first-degree sexual assault, second-degree sexual assault, third-degree sexual assault, first-degree child molestation sexual assault, and second-degree child molestation sexual assault were not unconstitutional for setting out the prohibited conduct in one section of a chapter in Rhode Island’s General Laws, and setting out the penalty in the subsequent section because that arrangement did not somehow render those statutes without legal force and effect.

        Where there is overwhelming evidence that the defendant did more than sit idly by while his codefendant committed a murder and that the defendant shared in his codefendant’s criminal intent, the trial justice is correct in allowing the jury to decide whether or not the defendant aided and abetted his codefendant’s criminal activity. State v. Tarvis,

        A jury instruction on aiding and abetting which omitted any reference to the “intent of the principal” and referred only to the “criminal intent” was not improper where, before giving the instruction, the trial justice instructed the jury on the charge of murder, including the element of intent. Then, following the aiding and abetting instruction, the trial justice explained the element of intent. State v. Leuthavone,

       <p>
        In a murder prosecution, the trial court’s aiding and abetting instruction accurately reflected the law with respect to intent because it explained that only if defendant knowingly and intentionally aided and abetted could he be held responsible for the natural or probable consequences of that act. Thus, his due process rights were not violated by a conclusive or burden-shifting presumption. State v. Delestre,

       <p>
        The year-and-a-day rule, which established a conclusive presumption that when death occurs more than a year and a day after the criminal act, the death was due to natural causes rather than a result of the criminal act, was in effect and hence accepted by our State Legislature as part of our jurisprudence, both before and after the enactment of our constitution in 1842, as being part of the body of common law that had not been specifically abrogated by the writers of the constitution. The rule, however, does not remain viable in light of the state of modern medical and forensic science and the structure of procedural protections afforded criminal defendants by various statutes, case law, and rules of practice and procedure and is therefore abrogated.

        Retroactive application of the abrogation of the year-and-a-day rule, would “aggravate” the crime of assault and battery, making it greater than it was when committed or greater than it could have been before the expiration of a year and a day, and, although the ex post facto prohibition applies to legislation only, the due-process clause prevents the accomplishment by judicial construction of that which is not permitted by statute, therefore, the abrogation of the rule will not be applied retroactively.

        In light of deference to the fact-finder, and because the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive material evidence, the trial justice did not commit reversible error in finding defendant failed to prove legal insanity by a preponderance of the evidence, and therefore defendant’s murder conviction was proper. The trial justice agreed that the deliberateness with which defendant had obtained the murder weapon, along with defendant’s clear recollection of the events and calm and cooperative demeanor following the murder, taken together, indicated defendant had not killed in a psychotic delusion.

         Double Jeopardy.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Double jeopardy does not bar the state from proceeding on all three available theories of murder in the second degree where a charge of second degree murder had been reinstated without limitation one day after the grant of a judgment of acquittal on the charge. State v. Iovino,
        <cite class="ocri">
         554 A.2d 1037

       </p>
       <p>
        Although first-degree murder and second-degree murder constitute the “same offense” under Rhode Island law, the defendant’s retrial for second-degree murder, the lesser-included offense, following his acquittal on the charge of first-degree murder, did not violate his constitutional rights against double jeopardy embodied in R.I. Const., art. 1, § 7, and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, since first-degree murder also requires proof of premeditation of more than a momentary duration and proof of deliberation, whereas second-degree murder does not, thus satisfying the applicable “same evidence” test. State v. Grabowski,

        Since the state relied only upon the robbery evidence to establish a violation of the defendant’s probationary status, the state is not collaterally estopped from prosecuting the defendant on two counts of murder pursuant to the indictment now pending. State v. Perry,

        Defendant waived an argument that convictions and separate sentences for second-degree murder and carrying a dangerous weapon in the commission of a crime of violence violated double jeopardy guarantees by failing to raise the issues in a pretrial motion; nonetheless, the court ruled on the merits and held in furtherance of Rodriguez, that the two crimes were separate for double jeopardy purposes as each required an element that the other did not, namely, commission of a murder and the carrying of a dangerous weapon.

        The defendant’s Fifth Amendment rights were not violated by allowing the jury to consider incriminating statements he made to police officers after having expressed a desire to consult an attorney. Lionberg v. Moran,

       <p>
        Trial court’s denial of the defendants’ attempts to cross-examine the state’s witness regarding a written statement given to the police was reversible error because the amount of corroborating evidence was not so extensive as to render the impeachment of the witness with prior-inconsistent-statement evidence unimportant. Although defense counsel did have the opportunity to cross-examine the witness regarding his prior criminal record and his ability to perceive the events on the night of the attack, the cross-examination was cut short and defense counsel could not probe the highly relevant area that the witness himself may have been firing a gun at the defendants during the attack. Evidence of gunfire coming from the victim’s car would have undermined the state’s first-degree-murder case because such evidence implied a question of self-defense or absence of premeditation. State v. Doctor,

        Although all the evidence adduced at trial may not have been credible, all of the elements of second degree murder were proven as the evidence presented by the state showed that the defendant shot the victim with no provocation after a chance encounter. State v. Banach,

        The trial testimony of the witness who placed the defendant at the scene with motive and with the handgun, whom the trial court found to be “extremely credible,” coupled with the additional probative evidence, both direct and circumstantial, from the police officers, the crime lab expert and the medical examiner was sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to conclude the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt.

        In a first-degree murder case, testimony by the State’s second expert that he agreed with the first expert’s DNA analysis was not impermissible bolstering, as the first expert’s methodology had been vigorously attacked during cross-examination, and the second expert did not testify about the first expert’s credibility or truthfulness, but testified that the basis for his opinion was the objective scientific data and observations in the first expert’s worksheets.

        In a Rhode Island murder case, the trial justice properly exercised his discretion when he admitted evidence of a Florida murder because the evidence showed that defendant had a motive to kill the victim as she might later expose defendant, or his girlfriend, to prosecution for the Florida murder, something defendant was determined to prevent from happening by killing the victim; the trial justice determined that the probative value of the evidence was not outweighed by the potential for prejudice as the State refrained from referring to the Florida incident as a murder; and the trial justice provided multiple limiting instructions to the jury throughout trial.

        In a second-degree murder case, although three-and-a-half-minutes of the “seven minute-plus video” focused on the deceased eight-year-old girl in her bed and was a disturbing sight, the video was not offered solely to inflame the passions of the jury, as would be required to prevent its admission, and it was admissible because it was probative. The video displayed the pathway of the struggle which presumably ensued between defendant and her child; and the video allowed the jury to see imagery of the floor next to the bed where the final struggle allegedly occurred and the bed in which defendant ultimately placed the child’s body.

        As a reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant possessed the weapon used in the murder and both rounds which hit the victim were fired from the same weapon and from the same direction and that defendant fired those rounds, defendant was not entitled to a judgment of acquittal as to the charges of second-degree murder, discharging a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence resulting in the death of another, and unlicensed possession of a firearm.

        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant for the second-degree murder of her new-born child because the State showed that she took affirmative steps to prevent the discovery of her child’s birth by refusing her sisters’ access to the bathroom where the birth occurred, by hiding the body of her infant immediately upon birth, by protesting when her family sought medical attention for her after the birth, by rebuffing physicians’ suspicions that she had given birth, by not seeking medical care while pregnant, and by not seeking medical attention for the child, and by exposing her to conditions that resulted in her death.

        The fact that the victim was an accomplice to the felony does not prevent the defendant from being convicted of felony murder, so long as an act of the felon foreseeably produced the fatal injury. In re Leon,

        Because the state must prove all the elements of arson as well as all of the elements of murder for a felony-murder conviction under this section and because only one of the offenses requires proof of a fact that the other does not, the underlying arson-felony necessarily merges with the murder. Accordingly, separate though concurrent sentences for the two offenses constitute double punishment for the same offense, thereby violating the double-jeopardy clauses of both the federal and state constitutions.

        First-degree felony murder convictions of defendants were reversed since the trial court erred by denying defendants’ motion for a judgment of acquittal; their proven attempt to acquire a large amount of a controlled substance ($43,000 worth), without some further act directed at delivery or distribution of the contraband, did not satisfy the substantial step required to constitute attempted distribution or delivery to support a conviction under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-1. R.I. Gen. Laws § 21-284.01(a)(1) criminalized possession with intent to manufacture or deliver, whereas R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-1 omitted any reference to possession with intent to deliver and instead incorporated the language referring to a sale or other distribution, which was not the offense defendants’ felony-murder charge was predicated upon.

        The limited nature of the prosecutor’s charge adequately informed the members of the grand jury with respect to the elements of murder so as to enable them to make a determination about the existence of probable cause, and the prosecutor’s omission of the specific elements of first-degree murder in his instruction to the grand jury is not an “extreme circumstance” that merits dismissal of the indictment.

        Defendants presented no evidence of malice as a basis for voluntary manslaughter, nor did they present evidence of involuntary manslaughter, thus there was no basis for a jury instruction on a lesser-included offense to murder. State v. DePina,

        Defendant testified he: (1) repeatedly struck the victim in the head with a board with protruding nails after the victim attacked him with the board; (2) repeatedly hit the victim with the board after the victim tried to grab him and pull him down after defendant started to walk away; and (3) hit him again with the board, when the victim was on the ground and was trying to get up; therefore the evidence supported instructions for second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter and self-defense, but not involuntary manslaughter since the victim’s death was not the product of an unintentional killing.

        Where the defendant presents evidence that the victim entered defendant’s apartment uninvited, ignored repeated warnings to leave, and then attempted to draw a weapon, the jury could conclude that the defendant’s decision to fire his weapon was the result of fear generated by the victim’s actions.

        In a prosecution for murder in violation of R.I. Gen.

        In a trial for first-degree murder, defendant was not entitled to an instruction on the lesser-included offense of voluntary manslaughter, because there was no evidence presented as to defendant’s level of intoxication following defendant’s alcohol consumption and defendant’s numerous voluntary and conscious actions on the night in questions illustrated that defendant’s intoxication was not of such a degree as to completely paralyze defendant’s will.

        In a trial for murder in the first degree it was not error for the trial justice to refuse to instruct the jury that it might return a verdict of murder in the second degree or manslaughter where there was no evidence in the case to support a finding of murder in the second degree or manslaughter.

        If trial counsel for the defendant believes that the evidence warrants a second degree murder instruction because the defendant acted in a wanton and reckless manner or in the course of an inherently dangerous felony, he should request a specific instruction regarding these theories of second degree murder. Trial counsel’s failure to make such a request precludes the Supreme Court from considering a challenge to the trial justice’s refusal to give a second-degree murder instruction. State v. Tarvis,

        Before the trial justice is required to give lesser included offense instruction on manslaughter, the evidence must show, however minimally, that the defendant acted without malice, either in the heat of passion with adequate provocation or in the commission of an unlawful nonfelonious act or in the performance of a lawful act with criminal negligence. State v. Kaner,

        Trial court’s failure to instruct the jury properly on the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter was reversible error, where the court did not explain to the jury that the absence of a specific intent to kill owing to a defendant’s diminished capacity resulting from the use of drugs and alcohol would reduce the crime of murder to the lesser included crime of voluntary manslaughter.

        Before a trial justice is required to give an instruction on manslaughter by reason of diminished capacity the evidence, however minimal, must permit a reasonable jury to find that the defendant, due to his or her diminished capacity, was incapable of forming a specific intent upon which malice could be predicated.

        A murder defendant is not entitled to a lesser-included-offense instruction on manslaughter, where the statute of limitations bars prosecution for the lesser offense and there is no risk of capital punishment. State v. Sullivan,

       <p>
        Trial court did not err in denying defendant’s request for an instruction on second degree murder. In order to be entitled to this jury charge, there must be minimal evidence tending to show either the defendant did not act with premeditation, or that he lacked capacity, or that he acted in the heat of passion. The defendant did not present a scintilla of evidence of these mediating circumstances, indeed there was ample evidence that defendant had threatened to harm the victim, had contemplated the killing of the victim for days before the murder, and additionally, his sole defense was mistaken identity, totally inconsistent with a defense of diminished capacity or heat of passion.

        The facts of this case clearly demonstrate that the defendant and his aider and abetter intended to kill the victim before they returned to the party armed with guns. Thus, no rational jury could have found the defendant guilty of merely murder in the second degree, and the trial court did not commit error by refusing to give a second-degree murder instruction.

        A second-degree murder instruction that encompassed both a momentary premeditation and a wanton, reckless theory of killing and set forth the elements of first- and second-degree murder and the factors distinguishing the two offenses was adequate. State v. Parkhurst,

        Defendant’s conviction for second-degree murder was affirmed where the court’s instructions to the jury on intent sufficiently covered the subject matter of defendant’s request for a mistake-of-fact instruction such that the court’s refusal to give the latter instruction did not constitute reversible error.

        Trial justice did not err in refusing to give a second-degree murder instruction as: (1) defendant’s decision to kill the victim was not instantaneous; and (2) demonstrated sustained determination to come within firing range of the victim, further supported the conclusion that defendant exhibited more than momentary resolve to commit the murder.

        With regard to defendant’s convictions for second-degree murder and for failing to report a death with the intention of concealing a crime, involving the strangulation death of his wife and concealing her in a padlocked closet in the apartment they had previously rented, the trial court did not err by instructing the jury that premeditation was not an element of second-degree murder and by instructing the jury on second-degree murder as a lesser included offense to first-degree murder.

        Rhode Island precedent recognizes three theories of second-degree murder, each based in a different aspect of malice aforethought: (1) killings in which defendant formed a momentary intent to kill contemporaneous with the homicide; (2) felony murder for inherently dangerous felonies that are not expressly listed within the statutory definition of first-degree murder; and (3) killings in which the defendant killed with wanton recklessness or conscious disregard for the possibility of death or of great bodily harm.

        If a defendant charged with a specific-intent crime presents sufficient evidence of his or her voluntary intoxication, the state is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not so intoxicated so as to be unable to harbor the requisite specific intent. But where the defendant failed to present sufficient evidence of intoxication to negate his intent to kill the victim, it was not necessary for the trial justice to charge the jury that the state had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not so intoxicated so as to be unable to form the intent to kill.

        Involuntary manslaughter occurs when, without malice aforethought, an unintentional death results from a voluntary act, one that a reasonable person, acting in a similar manner, would not expect to cause death or serious injury; voluntary manslaughter, on the other hand, occurs when an intentional death results from a voluntary act—that is, one that a reasonable person acting in a similar manner would expect to cause death or serious injury—that occurs without malice aforethought, in the heat of passion, and is the product of adequate legal provocation.

        The evidence was sufficient to support a finding of premeditation and intent since the evidence presented by the state demonstrated that in addition to a heinous attack with multiple blows by a heavy object and the discovery at the scene of gloves that had obviously been removed after the murder, the medical examiner testified that before the fatal blows were inflicted the victim was rendered unconscious by strangulation.

        Trial court properly denied defendant’s motion in limine to exclude three letters that he wrote to his girlfriend while they were both incarcerated pending charges against them from their criminal conduct, as the letters were relevant pursuant to

        and the probative value outweighed any prejudicial effect; two of the letters suggested defendant’s motives for killing the victim and were probative of premeditation for purposes of first-degree murder, in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-1, and the third letter was reflective of defendant’s guilty knowledge by indicating to the girlfriend that she should comply with a cover-up scheme. State v. Drew,

        Trial justice placed adequate weight on defendant’s actions prior to the victim’s death in determining that her murder was premeditated. The trial justice did not err when she determined that the evidence was adequate to support a conviction for first-degree murder. State v. Greenslit,

       <p>
        In a first-degree murder case, defendant’s motion for a new trial was properly denied as the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence because the circumstantial evidence supported a finding that defendant was the perpetrator—the evidence placed defendant at the victim’s home before and around the time of the murder and fire, showed the victim’s increasing anger at defendant in the hours leading up to the murder, and showed that the victim’s cell phone was eventually retrieved with defendant’s belongings; and the defensive wounds on the victim’s hand, together with the vicious, forceful nature of the throat slashing, supported a finding of a murder that was willful, deliberate, malicious, and premeditated.

        Trial court had not been required to charge the jury that it had to be unanimous as to the theory supporting a finding of guilt of second degree murder—i.e., whether defendant was guilty either as a principal, or as an aider and abettor, or as a coconspirator. The jury did not have to agree on the underlying facts, but only on the “bottom line” elements: whether there was an unlawful killing done with malice aforethought. State v. Delestre,

        In a prosecution for first-degree murder, the trial court properly charged the jury that it could infer malice from the disparity in size or strength between the victim and defendant, as defendant was 44 and weighed 163 pounds, and the victim was 66 and weighed 147 pounds, was in poor health, and had a blood alcohol level of 0.152 percent at the time of his death.

        In a case where defendant was found guilty of the second-degree murder of her eight-year-old daughter, the trial justice’s instructions adequately conveyed that the jury could not find defendant guilty of second-degree murder if the child’s death occurred by accident because, specifically, the instructions indicated that second-degree murder had to be committed willfully and that, if the death were accidental, then it could not be willful; and the instructions further described that, if defendant’s actions were accidental, then they could not be considered intentional acts of defendant for purposes of the jury’s determination of second-degree murder.

        Although the indictment did not expressly charge defendant with second-degree felony murder or with felony child abuse and the trial justice gave an instruction on second-degree felony murder using felony child abuse as the predicate felony, (1) defendant was not deprived of fair notice and an opportunity to present a meaningful defense; and (2) there was substantial evidence for the jury to determine that defendant committed an inherently dangerous felony when he hit the six-year-old victim in the stomach.

        A defendant who asserts the defense of self-defense is now entitled to adduce relevant evidence of specific acts of violence perpetrated by the victim against third parties, provided however that the defendant was aware of these acts at the time of his encounter with the victim.

        When a defendant asserts the defense of self-defense, he may introduce evidence of the victim’s reputation for violent behavior either for the purpose of showing the reasonableness of his fear of imminent bodily harm or for the purpose of showing that the victim was the aggressor.

        Before a trial justice can admit evidence of violent acts perpetrated by the victim against third parties, the defendant must show that he was aware of the specific act or acts of violence and that the act or acts sought to be introduced are not too remote in time and are of such a quality as to be capable of contributing to the defendant’s fear of the victim.

        Use of deadly force with an honest but mistaken belief that such conduct is required for self-defense is another name for the doctrine of imperfect self-defense and purports to reduce the crime of murder to voluntary manslaughter under the underlying theory that when a defendant uses deadly force with an honest but unreasonable belief that it is necessary to defend himself, the element of malice, necessary for a murder conviction, is lacking; Rhode Island does not recognize the doctrine of imperfect self-defense. State v. Ortiz,

       <p>
        Rhode Island rejects the doctrine of imperfect self-defense as a means to reduce a charge of murder to manslaughter; the theory of imperfect self-defense does not entitle defendant to an involuntary-manslaughter jury instruction because a killing committed in self-defense is, nevertheless, an intentional killing.

        Proof of probable cause to arrest does not require the same degree of proof needed to convict the defendant at trial; when considering the existence of probable cause, appeals courts deal in probabilities which are not technical and which are the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent people, not legal technicians, act.

        Where the issue is not the alleged diminished capacity of a defendant, but whether the circumstances of a killing amounted to self-defense, murder, or voluntary manslaughter, the victim’s impairment because of his consumption of alcohol is relevant in assessing the credibility of what the defendant tells the police about his encounter with the victim.

        During defendant’s trial on a charge of second-degree murder, a trial court did not err by refusing defendant’s requested instruction for the presumption of reasonable means of self-defense under R.I.

        Ample evidence supported the trial justice’s conclusion that the defendant should be subjected to the penalty of life imprisonment without parole since a murder was committed in a manner involving torture and aggravated battery to the victim,
        the record overwhelmingly supported a finding of premeditation, and there was only one isolated statement on the record concerning his having failed to take antipsychotic medication. State v. Smith,

        Defendant was not entitled to a correction of his sentence of life imprisonment because once defendant was found guilty of first-degree murder, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-2, the sentence of life imprisonment was not only authorized by law, it was mandatory. State v. Texieira,

        Evidence was legally sufficient to sustain the first defendant and second defendant’s convictions on the same nine offenses as to each defendant, arising out of their conduct in running into the street and firing a “fusillade of shots” into a departing vehicle with five occupants inside. As a result, the trial court was authorized to deny the first defendant and second defendant’s R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal, especially as to charges such as R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-1 first-degree murder, as the evidence supported a finding that the first defendant and second defendant had engaged in a premeditated act that involved the unlawful killing of another human being.

        Even though the penalty of execution has been determined to be constitutionally impermissible the intention of the legislature to create a specific and separate category of crime by the third sentence of this section is clear and phrase in indictment “while committed to confinement . . . in violation of . . . § 11-23-2” was not required to be stricken.

        In evaluating the Rhode Island sentencing procedures in regard to the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment without parole, the penalty cannot be equated with that of death, and cases involving the death penalty are of limited usefulness in assessing the constitutionality of a sentence of a term of life imprisonment without parole. State v. Lassor,

        There is no constitutional limitation upon the power of the legislature to define one of the aggravating circumstances as murder commited in the course of a robbery, even though such a definition would be applicable to felony murder. State v. Travis,

        Defendant’s constitutional rights were not violated because the Rhode Island Legislature, by enacting the mandatory sentencing scheme in R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-2, did not usurp the judicial power by depriving the trial justice of his or her sentencing discretion as it was for the Legislature, not the courts, to prescribe the scope of punishments.

        Since the penalties for murder listed in this provision are enumerated in the alternative, a jury’s finding that aggravated battery or torture was present under subsection (b)(4) is sufficient to authorize a judge to impose a sentence of life imprisonment without parole regardless of whether subsection (b)(3) is interpreted to apply to the person who arranged for a killing or only to the person who actually executed it.

        The state has the burden of proof regarding torture or aggravated battery for a sentence of life without parole. State v. Smith,
        <cite class="ocri">
         602 A.2d 931

        The trial justice was within her discretion in imposing the sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole where, confronted with a first-time offender found guilty of a particularly gruesome and heinous murder, she carefully considered the nature of the offense and the personal character and propensities of the offender and concluded that he would “never change from the completely evil person that he is.” State v. Tassone,
        <cite class="ocri">

       <p>
        The trial justice did not err in imposing sentences of life without parole upon the defendant for having participated in the murder of two children where the evidence demonstrated his knowledge of the potential presence of children in the house, where his actions in pouring and igniting gasoline in the dead of night represented conduct creating a great risk of death to more than one person, and where no evidence of any mitigating factors emerged at trial. State v. Garcia,
        <cite class="ocri">
         743 A.2d 1038

        The state met its burden of proof of demonstrating torture or aggravated battery sufficient to support a sentence of life without parole since the evidence showed that the victim fell to the ground after a blow to her head with a metal bar, and that she was hit again and then stabbed and cut repeatedly while she was still conscious. State v. Pacheco,
        <cite class="ocri">
         763 A.2d 971

        Where defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-1, and the evidence overwhelmingly supported the jury’s verdict, there was support for the imposition of a life sentence without the possibility of parole, pursuant to R.I. Gen.

        , the mitigating factors, the findings of the trial justice, and the personal character, record, and propensities of defendant did not outweigh the aggravating factors that were established. State v. Motyka,

         893 A.2d 267
        </cite>

       <p>
        First-degree murder defendant was properly sentenced to life imprisonment without parole as the victim’s slow, terrifying, and agonizing death justified the jury in finding the aggravating factors set forth in R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-2; defendant had 10 convictions in Rhode Island since 1995, including driving violations, drug offenses, and assaultive behavior; and defendant showed no remorse and took no responsibility for his actions. State v. Brown,
        <cite class="ocri">

        </cite>

        In a murder case, R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-2(1) permitted the trial justice to impose four consecutive life sentences as a result of defendant’s participation in a carjacking that resulted in the death of a young couple; the justice properly concluded that the brutality of the murders alone justified a life sentence without parole, even though acknowledging that defendant had had a troubled childhood, because the justice emphasized that defendant possessed a free will and a modicum of intelligence. State v. Day,
        <cite class="ocri">

       <p>
        Defendant’s sentence of life without parole for the first-degree murder of his wife was proper, as defendant repeatedly stabbed his wife as the she lay crouched in a fetal position on the floor, vulnerable and defenseless, and continued to stab her even after rendering her helpless. State v. McManus,
        <cite class="ocri">
         941 A.2d 222

       <p>
        Trial justice in determining whether to impose a life sentence without the possibility of parole, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-2(3), appropriately asked the jury to determine whether the killing of the victim was a murder for hire because ample evidence was presented at trial that defendant killed the victim at the request of the victim’s brother-in-law in exchange for money, and there was no requirement that defendant was to have been paid in advance for the murder.

        Where the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrated that the murder was committed in a manner involving torture or aggravated battery to the victim, a sentence of life in prison without the possibility for parole was appropriate. Page v. State,

        Sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole was appropriate, where the evidence showed, inter alia, that the murder was committed in a manner involving both torture and aggravated battery to the victim; the inmate’s actions served as signal to other potential informants they would not only be killed should they choose to inform, but that they would die in the torment that the victim did; and the inmate had a prior criminal history that included no fewer than 10 criminal charges.

        Defendant’s sentence of life imprisonment without parole, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-2, was appropriate because defendant brutally murdered a twenty-seven-year law enforcement veteran with the officer’s own firearm, abused drugs, had a history of violent crime, and any hope of defendant’s rehabilitation was far outweighed by his danger to the community.

       <p>
        Defendant’s sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole was appropriate considering defendant’s lack of remorse and the extreme brutality evident in the murder, where the victim was stabbed 40 times with a serrated knife. The brutal slaying undoubtedly fell within the definition of aggravated battery. State v. Lopez,

        Defendant, convicted of the first-degree murder of his girlfriend, was properly sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, because the evidence supported the jury’s finding that he committed the murder with aggravated battery and torture, as well as the trial court’s finding that his character and propensities made it unlikely that he would be rehabilitated.

        A defendant should be given the opportunity to present any reasonably relevant factors as mitigating circumstances to the trial justice. The trial justice may then determine whether such mitigating circumstances should result in his or her declining to impose the penalty of life imprisonment without parole. State v. Travis,

        Trial justice’s failure to define the terms “torture” and “aggravated battery” for the jury do not constitute error that invalidates the finding of that aggravating circumstance by the jury. State v. Travis,

        Murder was committed in a manner involving torture or aggravated battery to the victim, where the victim was subjected to twenty-three stab wounds, and the victim’s hands were bound behind her back so that at least a portion of the brutal stabbing could be inferred to have taken place after she had been rendered helpless to resist.

        Where defendant waived the right to a jury trial and was found guilty of domestic murder in the first degree, the trial judge had authority to impose a life imprisonment sentence without parole where she found an aggravating factor beyond a reasonable doubt; there was no requirement that R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-2 had to be included in the indictment because the Attorney General had given notice of his intent to seek such penalty within 20 days of the arraignment, pursuant to R.I. Gen.

        Where the imposition of a consecutive life sentence on a serial killer was otherwise legal, but the original sentencing court failed to allow an opportunity for allocution until after sentence had already been imposed, the sentencing court committed error in failing to vacate and resentence; the resulting sentence was only illegally imposed, however, rather than illegal, so that it could only be challenged within the 120-day time limit provided by rule.

        Defendant was not entitled to a correction of his sentence of life imprisonment because once defendant was found guilty of first-degree murder, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-2, the sentence of life imprisonment was not only authorized by law, it was mandatory. State v. Texieira,

        As the trial court heard the R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35 motion to reduce sentence and concluded that there were no mitigating circumstances warranting a sentence reduction of the defendant’s life sentence for second degree murder related to his inadvertent shooting of a bystander, instead, it focused on the impact of defendant’s actions had on the victim’s family, defendant failed to establish that the trial court improperly denied the motion and that his sentence was without justification.

        To find criminal liability for involuntary manslaughter under the criminal negligence theory, evidence of the defendant’s awareness of the victim’s peril and his failure to act are not sufficient to support a conviction. To find criminal liability for failing to act, there must first exist a legal duty to act, imposable by either the common law or by statutory mandate. State v. McLaughlin,

        Testimony that the defendant drank on the afternoon and evening of the murder and that the defendant drank frequently fell well short of demonstrating that the defendant’s will was so paralyzed that he was unable to withstand evil impulses or to form any sane design. Therefore, the trial court properly refused to instruct the jury on manslaughter by reason of diminished capacity. State v. Johnson,
        <cite class="ocri">

        Where the evidence did not show that defendant was acting under extreme provocation of fear of violence, and where defendant also had cooling down time between earlier altercations and a final confrontation with the victim, there was no reason to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter as a lesser included offense of second-degree murder.

        In a prosecution for murder in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-1, defendant was not entitled to an instruction on voluntary manslaughter, as her assertion that the victim assaulted her and tried to rob her was not supported by admissible evidence, and failed to establish that she acted in the heat of passion on sudden provocation.

        In a trial for first-degree murder, defendant was not entitled to an instruction on the lesser-included offense of voluntary manslaughter, because there was no evidence presented as to defendant’s level of intoxication following defendant’s alcohol consumption and defendant’s numerous voluntary and conscious actions on the night in question illustrated that defendant’s intoxication was not of such a degree as to completely paralyze defendant’s will.

       <p>
        The word “assault” as used in the statute should be accorded its ordinary meaning. State v. Camerlin,
        <cite class="ocri">
         116 R.I. 726
        </cite>
        ,

        (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        As a matter of statutory construction, an assault under this section perpetrated in the course of an escape under this section does not necessarily merge in the escape. State v. Robalewski,
        <cite class="ocri">
         418 A.2d 817
        </cite>
        ,

       <p>
        A prisoner who is serving a period of confinement in a correctional institution remains in the custody of the warden during the time that the prisoner is temporarily outside the confines of the institution. That someone other than the warden is responsible for transporting or guarding the prisoner while outside the confines of the adult correctional institutions in no way diminishes the fact that the warden is ultimately responsible for and in control of the prisoner, and an escape by a prisoner during such period of transportation, constitutes a violation of this section. State v. Tregaskis,

        The legislature clearly intended to insure the imposition of additional punishment for the crime of escape, independent of any other sentence under which a prisoner was serving or being held. State v. D'Amico,
        <cite class="ocri">

         Original Sentence.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The legislature used the words “original term” in this section to mean the aggregate term of consecutive sentences under which the prisoner was being held at the time of the escape and it was the legislative intent that the escape sentence was to begin at the expiration of the last of such consecutive sentences. State v. D'Amico,
        <cite class="ocri">

        (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where legislature enacted a statute setting out that escapee from maximum custodial unit be sentenced for not less than one nor more than twenty years “except where the original sentence was imprisonment for life,” said term to commence following the expiration of the original term of such prisoner, it did not intend to favor life termer by exempting him from judicial punishment, and thus such statute in order to avoid patently absurd result would be construed as if it read that escapee be sentenced not less than one nor more than twenty years, said term to commence from the expiration of the original term of such prisoner except where the original sentence was imprisonment for life.

        (1982), holding that in order to come within the reach of this section, any confinement or imprisonment must have some independent significance, and thus any movement of a victim during the course of a crime cannot be punished as kidnapping unless such movement exceeds that necessary to facilitate the crime at hand, shall apply prospectively to those cases tried 30 or more days after July 29, 1981, the date on which Innis was published.

        To fall within the kidnapping statute, the confinement or imprisonment must have some independent significance from other crimes committed, and cannot be merely that confinement necessary for the commission of other crimes. A confinement that is incidental to the commission of a crime is not punishable under this section. State v. Taylor,

       <p>
        The confinement and asportation of the victim has legal significance separate and apart from sexual assaults, where, for approximately four hours and at several locations, the defendant raped the victim repeatedly, and kept his leg hooked about the victim’s leg to prevent her escape from her car.

        (1982), is a judicially created rule designed to protect defendants against enhancement of offenses by the additional charge of kidnapping when the detention or asportation of the person is merely incidental to the commission of another crime. The implementation of this judicially treated rule is best entrusted to the trial justice and is therefore a question of law as opposed to a jury question. State v. Warner,

        The kidnapping of a minor statute, unlike the kidnapping statute, does not require that the act of confinement have “independent significance” from the act of child-molestation sexual assault and, in fact, expressly prohibits the confinement or seizure of a child under sixteen years of age “with the intent of sexually assaulting or molesting the child.” State v. Suero,

       <p>
        Evidence that the first victim was forced into a car, thrown against the vehicle’s backseat floor, and traveled in at least three cities before being taken to wooded area, pulled out of the car, and dragged into dark woods, far exceeding what was necessary to commit a sexual assault, provided “independent significance” sufficient to support a kidnapping conviction under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-26-1. State v. Pablo,

       <p>
        Evidence supported a kidnapping charge; confining the victims to a small closet after they had been physically assaulted and sprayed with Mace and then leaving them there after the robberies were completed exposed the victims to a greater harm than the robberies initially posed. The confinement clearly exceeded that necessary for the commission of the robberies, could not be classified as having been merely incidental to the robberies, and made it significantly more difficult for the victims to escape, thereby concealing defendant’s criminal activity for a time.

        “Inveiglement” means to persuade a person to do something bad or hurtful by deceptive acts or by flattery, to seduce, to lead astray by false representations or other deceitful means. There need be no physical force, but mental control such as an instillation of fear is sufficient to satisfy the element of inveiglement. State v. Collins,

        Allowing the State of Rhode Island, in reliance on R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-27-3, to withhold attorneys’ fees due the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) would have frustrated the articulated purposes of
        <cite class="ocri">

        </cite>
        §§ 1983 and 1988, which included, inter alia, attracting competent counsel to pursue civil rights litigation on behalf of indigent people. Consequently, to the extent that R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 11-27-3 and 11-27-6 operated to prevent the ACLU from collecting the attorneys’ fees in dispute, they were inconsistent with

        Title insurer and agents did not engage in the unauthorized practice of law by conducting real estate closings because no harm was shown, and this century-old statutorily authorized practice did not subvert the authority of the Rhode Island Supreme Court to determine what is, and is not, the practice of law.

       <p>
        To avoid engaging in the unauthorized practice of law, a non-attorney closing agent must: (1) communicate to the buyer and the seller that the closing agent is not an attorney, does not represent the buyer or the seller, cannot and will not give legal advice, and, if the buyer or seller has a legal question, the buyer or seller should suspend the closing and seek counsel from an attorney; (2) present a written notice to the buyer and seller containing these warnings, which shall be the first document presented and signed, and require the buyer and the seller to read the document, (3) require the buyer and seller to sign a copy of the notice; (4) sign the notice; and (5) retain a signed copy of the notice.

        Title insurer’s drafting of a durable power of attorney for the limited purpose of a real estate closing does not constitute unauthorized practice of law if the durable power of attorney is strictly limited.

Laws §§ 11-27-3 and 11-27-6 operated to prevent the ACLU from collecting the attorneys’ fees in dispute, they were inconsistent with

V, R. 5.4(a) and 7.2(c) posed a less formidable obstacle since they did not impede the payment of legal fees to non-profit organizations such as the ACLU. Inmates of the R.I. Training Sch. v.

        Title insurer and agents did not engage in the unauthorized practice of law by conducting real estate closings because no harm was shown, and this century-old statutorily authorized practice did not subvert the authority of the Rhode Island Supreme Court to determine what is, and is not, the practice of law.

        To avoid engaging in the unauthorized practice of law, a non-attorney closing agent must: (1) communicate to the buyer and the seller that the closing agent is not an attorney, does not represent the buyer or the seller, cannot and will not give legal advice, and, if the buyer or seller has a legal question, the buyer or seller should suspend the closing and seek counsel from an attorney; (2) present a written notice to the buyer and seller containing these warnings, which shall be the first document presented and signed, and require the buyer and the seller to read the document, (3) require the buyer and seller to sign a copy of the notice; (4) sign the notice; and (5) retain a signed copy of the notice.

        Probable cause to arrest for obstruction of justice may arise, in certain circumstances, from the spoken word rather than an actual physical interference with the police officer. De Fusco v. Brophy,

        Where officers responded to call concerning a disturbance, and in attempting to enforce city ordinance were met with shouting of obscenities at the officers for eight or nine minutes, evidence was sufficient for jury to find that officers had probable cause to arrest such persons for obstructing an officer. Johnson v. Palange,

        In the case of a complaint for a violation of an obstructing-justice statute, four elements must be averred for it not to be constitutionally defective. The complaint must state: (1) that the defendant acted knowingly, (2) that the defendant “resisted” or “obstructed” a peace officer, (3) that the defendant knew the peace officer was in fact a peace officer, and (4) that the peace officer was performing an authorized act within his official capacity.

        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of obstructing officers in executing their duty because the lieutenant testified that defendant defied the officers’ authority and used every effort to avoid handcuffs; and the lieutenant testified that the second officer came to his assistance and as a result of defendant’s actions, a scuffle occurred where punches were thrown and force was exchanged.

        The two witnesses rule for a conviction of perjury has been abrogated and circumstantial evidence without regard to the number of prosecution witnesses is sufficient to support a conviction in accordance with § 11-33-5. State v. Casala,

        One false statement given under oath can be sufficient to constitute the crime of perjury; thus, defendant’s conviction for providing a false alibi for a family member’s fiance was proper because defendant knowingly made the false material statement under oath. State v. Sivo,

        Although the clerk at the motion hearing testified that he did not specifically recall administering the oath to the defendant, he did testify that it was his usual practice to do so and the record shows that defendant was sworn prior to his testimony, the state’s evidence on pleading and proving that defendant swore an oath was sufficient to warrant a finding of fact.

Following the entry of an order declaring the property forfeited, the court may, upon application of the law enforcement agency, enter any appropriate orders, require the execution of satisfactory performance bonds, appoint receivers, conservators, appraisers, accountants, or trustees, or take any other action to protect the interest of the law enforcement agency in the motor vehicle ordered forfeited.

Any such motor vehicle that is subsequently transferred to any person may be the subject of a special verdict of forfeiture and thereafter shall be ordered forfeited to the state, unless the transferee establishes in a hearing that he or she is a bona fide purchaser for value of the motor vehicle who at the time of purchase was reasonably without cause to believe that the motor vehicle was subject for forfeiture.

      Every person who, with intent to injure or defraud any person, persons, association, or corporation generating, conducting, using, or supplying the electric current, either for the purposes of his, her, its or their own business or for the purpose of selling the electric current at a stipulated rate of payment, shall make or cause to be made any wire or other instrument or contrivance and connect it or cause it to be connected with any electric wire, appliance, apparatus or appurtenance used for or in connection with the wires or apparatus employed for generating, conducting, using, or supplying electric current, in any manner that is calculated either to waste and dissipate the electric current or to supply the electric current to any lamp, burner, heater, machine, motor or other apparatus or appliance whatsoever, without the electric current passing through a meter provided by the person, persons, association, or corporation and used for registering the quantity so passing through, or without the consent of the person, persons, association, or corporation to the connections, or who shall otherwise use any electric current with the intent to defraud the person, persons, association or corporation of payment, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be imprisoned not exceeding thirty (30) days or be fined not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500). In any prosecution under this section proof that any of the acts specified in this section was done on or about the premises occupied by the defendant, or proof of the presence on or about the premises of any wire or other instrument or contrivance which effects the waste or dissipation or the diversion of electric current without the electric current being measured or registered by a meter provided for it or without the consent of the person, persons, association, or corporation, shall be prima facie evidence that the defendant committed the acts, or aided or abetted in their commission, maliciously and with intent to injure or defraud.

        Supreme Court would not consider defendant’s claim that there was insufficient evidence produced at trial to prove that he was guilty of obstructing or damaging a telephone needed for an emergency call in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-35-14. Because defendant did not raise at trial the issue of whether an emergency existed, as contemplated by § 11-35-14(b)(2), application of the “raise-or-waive” rule precluded review. State v. Forand,

        The trial court’s failure to read to the jury the statutory definition of “intercept” and “intercepting device” was not reversible error since he read § 11-35-21(a) to the jury verbatim and he carefully instructed the jurors that the defendant could not be convicted of the offense charged unless there was an interception of an “oral communication.” State v. O'Brien,
        <cite class="ocri">
         774 A.2d 89

       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court’s refusal to give a “for the purpose of” instruction did not constitute reversible error since remarks by the court that the state had to show that the violation was “willful” injected into its instructions the correct reading of the law, since “willful” means “intentional” in the context of the state wiretapping statute, and since intentional in this context is functionally equivalent to “for the purpose of.” State v.

        The trial justice did not err in determining that the preservation of abominable and detestable crime against nature charges against the defendant would have been inconsistent with the manifest intention of the legislature to decriminalize sodomy between consenting adults and that such preservation would be repugnant to the statute as amended.

        Where the evidence tended to show that defendant, a uniformed police officer armed with handcuffs and a gun, used his position of authority to intimidate an alcoholic young woman into performing oral sex upon him, it was held that the defendant’s position of authority, in and of itself, carried with it an implied threat, and this appearance of authority, combined with the fact that defendant was armed, and the peculiar vulnerability of the victim, were sufficient to support a jury verdict that defendant coerced submission by impliedly threatening the victim within the meaning of subdivision (2)(C).

        There is an element of forcible compulsion, or the threat of forcible compulsion that would prevent resistance by a person of reasonable resolution, inherent in the situation in which an adult who is with a child who is younger, smaller, less psychologically and emotionally mature, and less sophisticated than the adult, instructs the child to submit to the performance of sexual acts. State v. St. Amant,
        <cite class="ocri">

        There is no requirement in paragraph (C) that the threat be made during the actual commission of the sexual act. State v. Maggs,

       <p>
        The trial justice properly denied defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal where the only disputed issue was the use of force or coercion. Although the defendant made no specific threats of bodily harm, a guilty verdict could still be reached based on defendant’s threats of impending anger, physical restrictions of the victim and demand for sexual acts. State v. Lamoureux,
        <cite class="ocri">

        A defendant who used his position of authority in the household to order his step-daughter into the bedroom and, after placing her in a position of vulnerability, engaged in sexual contact with her, made “implied threats” constituting the use of force or coercion within this meaning of this section.

        With regard to defendant’s conviction for sexual assault wherein a trial justice found that all of the ingredients were present and his conclusion that all of the relevant hallmarks of force or coercion, both physical and psychological, were part of defendant’s misconduct, the appellate court vacated the conviction and remanded the case for the trial justice to conduct an independent examination of the evidence to determine whether the State had established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant was guilty of the charged crimes based solely on physical force. Because the trial justice erroneously found force and coercion by implied threats, the appellate court was uncertain about whether defendant was convicted based on a finding of force and coercion by physical force beyond a reasonable doubt which was separate and apart from the error.

        The trial justice committed reversible error in refusing to instruct the jurors that they were required to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant’s contact with his niece was for the purpose of his sexual arousal, gratification, or assault, in order to convict under the second-degree sexual-assault statutes, i.e., this section and § 11-37-4.

        Where the Rhode Island Supreme Court received more than 40 nearly identical petitions for writ of certiorari seeking review of the superior court’s denial of the respective petitioner’s postconviction relief application, all the petitions for writ of certiorari were denied as the statutes for murder, first-degree sexual assault, second-degree sexual assault, third-degree sexual assault, first-degree child molestation sexual assault, and second-degree child molestation sexual assault were not unconstitutional for setting out the prohibited conduct in one section of a chapter in Rhode Island’s General Laws, and setting out the penalty in the subsequent section because that arrangement did not somehow render those statutes without legal force and effect.

        Where defendant was accused of first-degree sexual assault of a developmentally disabled woman under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37-2, the expert’s testimony was sufficient to establish that the victim was mentally disabled under R.I. Gen.

        Where the only issue was the voluntariness of intercourse, it was error to admit examining physician’s testimony of the victim’s case history consisting of her out-of-court statements about the alleged rape when such statements narrated details not connected with either diagnosis or treatment of the alleged sexual assault.

        (R.I. 1983), involving evidence of a defendant’s sexual conduct with a child not named in the indictment, is limited to situations in which the testimony of siblings of tender years is both necessary in order for the state to meet its burden of proof and relevant, material, and highly probative of the accused’s lecherous conduct toward the victims over whom the defendant exercised discipline, control, and supervision.

        It was proper for the trial justice to inform the jury during his charge that the state did not have to prove that the alleged sexual assault took place within the dates stated in the indictment and that the jury need only find that the alleged act occurred on some day. State v. McKenna,

        Where, in a trial for first degree sexual assault on a 14-year-old child, in the context of the evidence, asking defendant whether he had a sexual problem, though concededly improper, would not have had the effect of inflaming the jury in such manner as to deprive its members of their ability to pass upon the evidence in the case in accordance with the trial justice’s instructions, thus the trial justice did not err in denying the motion for mistrial on that ground. State v. Brown,

        Defendant’s conviction was affirmed where, although the only testimony relative to the sexual act came from the victim, the trial justice clearly believed her version of what happened and pointed out that defendant was less than truthful in his testimony at trial. State v. Jacques,

        In a prosecution under subsection (C), the judge properly admits into evidence photographs depicting the injuries to the victim’s face, lower back, buttocks, legs and thighs, and vaginal area. The pictures are probative of an element of the crime, namely, force and coercion, and they depict the brutality of the beating the victim underwent at the hands of the defendant, thereby calling the defendant’s credibility into question.

        Evidence sustained the defendant’s conviction, where, only minutes before declaring his desire to have sexual intercourse with her, defendant had hit the victim so violently that he fractured her cheekbone, and the victim then acquiesced to defendant’s request for sex rather than risk the consequences of screaming for help or running away.

        With regard to defendant’s conviction for sexual assault wherein a trial justice found that all of the ingredients were present and his conclusion that all of the relevant hallmarks of force or coercion, both physical and psychological, were part of defendant’s misconduct, the appellate court vacated the conviction and remanded the case for the trial justice to conduct an independent examination of the evidence to determine whether the State had established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant was guilty of the charged crimes based solely on physical force. Because the trial justice erroneously found force and coercion by implied threats, the appellate court was uncertain about whether defendant was convicted based on a finding of force and coercion by physical force beyond a reasonable doubt which was separate and apart from the error.

        In a criminal assault trial, the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in allowing the jury to hear an audio-tape recording of the assault and the victim’s commentary on the same. Because it is incumbent upon the state to prove that the accused used force or coercion, the use of the audio tape offered probative evidence of such force and coercion. In regard to the use of the audio tape during the state’s direct examination of the victim, the probative value offered by this narrative exercise was to determine where each of the parties was and what each was doing at the time the tape was paused.

        Motions for judgment of acquittal and a new trial were properly denied since the trial justice’s analysis made clear that the victim’s state of mind at the time of sexual intercourse was a question of fact on which the jury could find that she was asleep and thus physically helpless during the penetration.

        Jury instruction that was given in defendant’s case was not erroneous because, pursuant to established jurisprudence, there was no proper basis to apply the rule announced in a later case regarding the element of force and coercion to the final judgment in defendant’s case as the later ruling did not alter or shift the burden of proof or plow any new ground.

        Although defendant’s requested jury instruction on the “force or coercion” element of first-degree sexual assault under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37-2 was refused and the term “lack of consent” was not explicitly utilized, a trial court’s instruction did employ the verb “overcomes,” which, when the instructions were read in their entirety, meant that as a precondition of guilt, the jury had to find a lack of consent by a victim. State v. Adefusika,

       <p>
        Jury instructions adequately apprised the jury of the operative legal concepts that were in play because the instruction adequately conveyed to the jury that, to find defendant guilty of first-degree sexual assault, it also needed to conclude that the victim did not consent to the penetration, and the trial justice did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on a consent defense that was unsupported by the testimony.

        In a prosecution for domestic first-degree sexual assault, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to declare a mistrial when a police officer improperly bolstered the victim’s credibility by testifying that she seemed “sincere” when she accused defendant, her husband, of sexual assault, in view of the brevity of the remark, the jurors’ opportunity to judge the victim’s truthfulness before the remark was made, and the trial court’s instruction to disregard the remark.

        In a prosecution for domestic first-degree sexual assault, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to declare a mistrial when the victim, defendant’s wife, testified that the police had issued to her a no-contact order against him, because 1) the trial court gave a cautionary instruction that the jurors could not use this testimony to find that defendant engaged in any prior misconduct; 2) the testimony was not sufficiently prejudicial as to prevent the jury from dispassionately considering the evidence; and 3) there was abundant evidence of defendant’s guilt.

        It is not inconsistent for the jury to convict defendant on only one of three first degree sexual assault charges, where there are three separate counts of sexual assault, one alleging penetration by penis, another alleging penetration with a stick of pepperoni, and another alleging digital penetration; the jury could have found that penetration was not accomplished other than by the penis or that if it was, force or coercion was not proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

        Where the Rhode Island Supreme Court received more than 40 nearly identical petitions for writ of certiorari seeking review of the superior court’s denial of the respective petitioner’s postconviction relief application, all the petitions for writ of certiorari were denied as the statutes for murder, first-degree sexual assault, second-degree sexual assault, third-degree sexual assault, first-degree child molestation sexual assault, and second-degree child molestation sexual assault were not unconstitutional for setting out the prohibited conduct in one section of a chapter in Rhode Island’s General Laws, and setting out the penalty in the subsequent section because that arrangement did not somehow render those statutes without legal force and effect.

        Trial court properly denied defendant’s new trial motion, as the evidence was legally sufficient to support his convictions for first-degree and second-degree sexual assault, as well as simple assault, as the trial justice acted within his province in choosing to find the victims’ testimony more credible than that of defendant.

        In a sexual assault case, the trial justice properly denied defendant’s motion for a new trial because there was no indication that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence; although defendant contended that the jury’s acquittal on the counts of first-degree sexual assault and assault with intent to commit first-degree sexual assault established that the jury discounted the victim’s version of events, the trial justice found that the victim’s overall appearance, testimony, and recollection of the events were credible and worthy of belief in relation to the five counts of second-degree sexual assault defendant was convicted of.

        With regard to defendant’s conviction for sexual assault wherein a trial justice found that all of the ingredients were present and his conclusion that all of the relevant hallmarks of force or coercion, both physical and psychological, were part of defendant’s misconduct, the appellate court vacated the conviction and remanded the case for the trial justice to conduct an independent examination of the evidence to determine whether the State had established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant was guilty of the charged crimes based solely on physical force. Because the trial justice erroneously found force and coercion by implied threats, the appellate court was uncertain about whether defendant was convicted based on a finding of force and coercion by physical force beyond a reasonable doubt which was separate and apart from the error.

        Because statutory rape can encompass both violent and non-violent conduct, it was permissible for a district court to examine the indictment to learn of the circumstances of the crime, but it was error for the court to delve into the facts of the crime in order to determine whether his conviction was for a violent or non-violent crime.

        Because of the risk, seriousness and likelihood of injury and disease resulting from the defendant’s criminal actions, there was no error in the conclusion of the sentencing court that he had been convicted of a violent felony and that he should be sentenced as an “armed career criminal” under the federal statute governing such offenders. United States v. Sacko,

        Trial court properly denied defendant’s motion for a new trial in her first-degree child molestation and third-degree sexual assault case because, inter alia, the trial court clearly articulated sound reasons for denying the motion, noted that the prosecution had presented four witnesses, summarized the testimony, and dismissed defendant’s contention that if the events actually occurred, the victim would have reported it to his father, noting that their father-son relationship was not such that such disclosure likely would occur; the trial court explained that it was impressed with the manner by which the victim testified and had no concern or suspicion surrounding any of the witnesses. The trial court believed that the jury could have concluded that defendant’s remarks about the paternity of her son were an admission of having engaged in sexual relationships with the victim.

        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the victim’s testimony that defendant sexually assaulted her over 100 times over the course of three years because the testimony was highly probative of defendant’s lewd disposition toward the victim and was indicative of a common opportunity, intent, and plan with the offense for which defendant was being tried, child molestation.

        Where the Rhode Island Supreme Court received more than 40 nearly identical petitions for writ of certiorari seeking review of the superior court’s denial of the respective petitioner’s postconviction relief application, all the petitions for writ of certiorari were denied as the statutes for murder, first-degree sexual assault, second-degree sexual assault, third-degree sexual assault, first-degree child molestation sexual assault, and second-degree child molestation sexual assault were not unconstitutional for setting out the prohibited conduct in one section of a chapter in Rhode Island’s General Laws, and setting out the penalty in the subsequent section because that arrangement did not somehow render those statutes without legal force and effect.

       <p>
        The first-degree child-molestation sexual-assault statute, like its second-degree sexual-assault counterpart, has an implied mens rea requirement requiring that the state must prove that a defendant must act with the intent of sexual arousal or gratification in order to be found guilty of the offense. It is true that the Legislature can enact strict liability statutes devoid of any mens rea; however, first-degree child-molestation sexual assault, which carries a minimum twenty-year sentence, is not a strict liability offense. Therefore, since the trial court failed to give an instruction requiring the jury to find that the defendant’s act of penetration was for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification, the defendant’s conviction must be vacated and the case must be remanded for a new trial. State v. Griffith,
        <cite class="ocri">
         660 A.2d 704
        </cite>
        ,

        (R.I. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Griffith doctrine, which holds that a trial court’s failure to charge a jury in a prosecution under this section that the defendant’s act was for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification is error, is not applicable to purposeful penile penetration (as opposed to digital penetration), which as a matter of law precludes innocent touching. In re Odell,

        Under the terms of this section the state need not offer proof that the act was committed against the wishes of the victim. The state is required merely to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) the defendant in fact engaged in the sexual penetration of the victim and (2) the victim was 13 (now 14) years of age or under.

        Trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal because the evidence was not duplicitous; the allegations for count one specifed one incident of child molestation, and the bill of particulars narrowed that incident to “the first time” penetration occurred. The victim testified about the first incident and her testimony about the more than 100 acts of uncharged conduct was vague and simply acknowledged that “the same thing happened every time.” State v.

        The victim’s testimony that she was unable to recall dates of sexual abuse because they “blurred together” went directly to the question of whether intercourse had occurred prior to the victim’s fourteenth birthday. Thus, the dates were crucial to the determination of defendant’s guilt or innocence and the trial judge should have reread all of the victim’s direct and cross-examination testimony about the timing rather than merely portions which the judge deemed relevant.

        Trial court was well within its discretion to deny defendant’s motion for new trial; although the victim’s testimony did contain disparities, the disparities reflected no more than minor details.

        Testimony by the victim of a first degree sexual assault of describing sexual acts committed by the defendant commencing some seven years before the acts with which the defendant was charged, clearly fit the exception to the rule regarding proof of uncharged sexual misconduct to show “lustful disposition or sexual propensity” pertinent to proof of prior incestuous relations; therefore, admission of the testimony was not error.

        In a prosecution under this section, it was error to preclude the defendant from informing the jury that the victim was five months pregnant at the time of the trial, as it was highly relevant that at the time she testified concerning incidents of sexual abuse, she had a source of sexual knowledge, independent of any of these acts, from which she could have learned the details of the sexual acts that she described.

        Testimony that the defendant and his daughter shared the same bed was not evidence of “other crimes” under Rule 404(b), R.I. Rules of Evidence. Rather, the testimony provided a good description of the defendant’s relationship with the minor child and the trial court correctly admitted such evidence, which was wholly relevant to the charge of first-degree child molestation.

        The mere fact that a minor victim closed her lips, made a pouting motion, and exhaled during her demonstration on the stand did not necessarily indicate a lack of the requisite oral contact with the respondent’s penis for fellatio to have occurred, and the trial justice was not clearly wrong in concluding that the evidence was both legally competent and sufficient to establish the act of fellatio.

        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in deciding, on relevance grounds, not to allow defendant to testify regarding his freedom from sexually transmitted diseases where the charges involved statutory rape, not infecting a sexual partner; defendant’s failure to make an offer of proof made it nearly impossible for the high court to second-guess the trial court.

        Where a victim’s credibility was buttressed by an earlier handwritten note, as well as by the defendant’s sister, who testified about a subsequent violent reaction that the victim had when confronted with the possibility of being alone with her father, the finding of a probation violation under R.I.

        Evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction of first-degree child molestation sexual assault; the trial justice did not err in denying a motion for a new trial where despite certain weaknesses in the child victim’s identification testimony, defendant’s own testimony bolstered the identification of defendant as the molester.

        In a prosecution for first-degree child molestation sexual assault, the State properly asked the 11-year-old victim leading questions, as she had difficulty grasping the legal significance of penetration and she was reluctant to recount the events of her molestation. Further, as the leading questions were asked to clarify the already existing record, defendant was not substantially prejudiced. State v. Merced,

        Where a child’s father caught defendant molesting the child, defendant’s first-degree child molestation conviction was upheld because: (1) the recording of the father’s 911 call was properly admitted as an excited utterance and a present sense impression; (2) the father’s statement to a police officer was properly admitted as an excited utterance; and (3) defendant’s new trial motion was properly denied.

        Trial court properly denied defendant’s motion for a new trial in her first-degree child molestation and third-degree sexual assault case because, inter alia, the trial court clearly articulated sound reasons for denying the motion, noted that the prosecution had presented four witnesses, summarized the testimony, and dismissed defendant’s contention that if the events actually occurred, the victim would have reported it to his father, noting that their father-son relationship was not such that such disclosure likely would occur; the trial court explained that it was impressed with the manner by which the victim testified and had no concern or suspicion surrounding any of the witnesses. The trial court believed that the jury could have concluded that defendant’s remarks about the paternity of her son were an admission of having engaged in sexual relationships with the victim.

        Where defendant was tried for committing offenses which, if committed by an adult, would constitute first-degree child molestation sexual assault, his claim that his due process right to present a defense was violated because the charges lacked specificity as to time and place was meritless.

        In a prosecution under this section, although an expert witness’ testimony that she had been counseling the victim for “sex abuse recovery” was not a literal statement of her belief in the victim’s truthfulness, it had the same substantive impact and would have been perceived by the jury as a conclusive opinion that the victim had testified truthfully.

        In a prosecution for child molestation, instructing the jury that evidence of the defendant’s criminal acts with persons other than the victim was to be received “solely on the issue of credibility” was tantamount to saying that the jury could receive and apply such evidence on the issue of guilt or innocence. Relying on this instruction, the jury could have found the defendant guilty if it believed that he had engaged in anal intercourse with his wife, a crime under § 11-10-1. The instruction, therefore, was both erroneous and highly prejudicial. State v. Haslam,

        Trial court did not err in admitting evidence of defendant’s touching a child victim’s sister because the evidence was non-remote and sufficiently similar to the charged offenses, was relevant to show defendant’s specific intent to sexually gratify, was reasonably necessary to support the victim’s credibility, and defendant waived the adequacy of the trial court’s cautionary instruction by not raising an objection prior to the jury’s deliberations.

        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the victim’s testimony that defendant sexually assaulted her over 100 times over the course of three years because the testimony was highly probative of defendant’s lewd disposition towards the victim and was indicative of a common opportunity, intent, and plan with the offense for which defendant was being tried, child molestation.

        Trial justice did not abuse her discretion in denying defendant’s motion for new trial, because the trial justice assessed the complainant’s credibility and found the complainant to be a witness worthy of belief, found that defendant offered no compelling reason for overturning the trial justice’s credibility determination, and the trial justice agreed with the jury’s finding and clearly articulated a reason for doing so.

        Trial justice did not err in failing to grant defendant’s motion for a new trial on the charges of first-degree sexual assault, where the trial justice thoroughly reviewed and summarized the testimony of all witnesses while also noting that there were some inconsistencies, and it was clear from the trial justice’s bench ruling that the trial justice concluded that reasonable minds could differ but was satisfied that the complainant and her sister were believable and credible.

        In a prosecution for first- and second-degree child molestation, the trial court properly denied defendant’s motion for a new trial, as it independently assessed the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, explicitly found that the complaining witness was credible and honest, and then determined that it would have reached the same result as the jury.

        Trial court properly denied defendant’s motion for a new trial after he was convicted of multiple counts of first- and second-degree child molestation, because its determination that the testimony of the victim and other State witnesses was credible while defendant’s testimony was not was entitled to deference and was not clearly wrong. State v. Lapierre,

       <p>
        Defendant was not entitled to a new trial as to convictions for first-degree child molestation and second-degree child molestation because (1) the victim’s testimony was found sufficient, without corroborating testimony and defendant’s confession, to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt, (2) the prosecutor was admonished for comments about defendant looking at counsel while testifying, and (3) defendant’s limiting instruction on the issue was given.

       <p>
        Trial justice conducted the proper three-step analysis in passing on defendant’s motion for a new trial and properly denied it, in connection with defendant’s conviction of first and second-degree child molestation; the minor victim’s younger brother’s testimony corroborated the victim’s testimony, the trial justice concluded that there was no way they fabricated the accusations, and defendant’s various arguments essentially amounted to nothing more than a disagreement with the trial justice’s assessment of witness credibility and the weight of the evidence. State v. Muralles,

        Trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal because the victim’s clarification was “precise” and “specific” as to vaginal penetration, and, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, it was adequate to prove penetration beyond a reasonable doubt.

        On the basis of the victim’s testimony, it was not inconsistent for the jury to find defendant guilty of first degree child molestation sexual assault for fellatio and not guilty of second degree child molestation sexual assault for vaginal contact. State v. Frye,

        Even though the state lacks authority to charge child sexual assault as a continuing course of conduct crime, this will not impede the conviction, upon a properly constituted indictment or bill of particulars, of a defendant who has repeatedly sexually abused a child; it is only necessary that each count should charge a single offense.

        Discrepancy between a judgment of conviction and a sentencing transcript did not require correction of defendant’s sentence for first-degree child molestation sexual assault under R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35 as: (1) defense counsel admitted twice that sentence for first-degree child molestation sexual assault was 50 years’ concurrent; (2) a five-year sentence would have been illegal under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37-8.2; and (3) the trial justice stated during sentencing that the convictions were just as egregious as the first first-degree child molestation sexual assault count, for which defendant was sentenced to life in prison.

        The trial justice acted within his discretion in imposing a sentence significantly longer than the sentence imposed at the defendant’s first trial where he appropriately considered factors subsequent to the first trial, such as the defendant’s flight, that shed light on the defendant’s propensities, and where he affirmatively placed his reasons on the record.

        Defendant’s challenge to the legality of his sentence for first-degree child molestation sexual assault in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37-8.1 was not properly before the court on direct appeal because defendant did not demonstrate the extraordinary circumstances necessary to circumvent the procedures set forth in R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35, since the imposed sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment, with six years to serve, fell within the bounds of defendant’s plea agreement, and was also within the statutory parameters of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37-8.2 and was consistent with the superior court sentencing benchmarks. State v. Pallister,

        Where the Rhode Island Supreme Court received more than 40 nearly identical petitions for writ of certiorari seeking review of the superior court’s denial of the respective petitioner’s postconviction relief application, all the petitions for writ of certiorari were denied as the statutes for murder, first-degree sexual assault, second-degree sexual assault, third-degree sexual assault, first-degree child molestation sexual assault, and second-degree child molestation sexual assault were not unconstitutional for setting out the prohibited conduct in one section of a chapter in Rhode Island’s General Laws, and setting out the penalty in the subsequent section because that arrangement did not somehow render those statutes without legal force and effect.

        Evidence showing that defendant removed the victim’s clothes, exposed his penis and with it made contact with the child’s vaginal area was sufficient to sustain his conviction, notwithstanding his contention that the sole purpose of any contact he might have had with the victim was to set up a sexual assault charge against his landlord with the aid of false testimony from the victim.

        Evidence of a defendant’s prior sexual assault on a child not known by the victims of the alleged offenses is relevant, where the theory of defense is that the victims have fabricated the evidence against defendant and have colluded in planning their testimony. State v. Messa,

       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction, where the victim testified that defendant touched her private parts and put his penis between her legs, the victim’s testimony was corroborated by testimony given by her sister, and the testimony was buttressed by sexually explicit photographs of defendant and the victim. State v. Shatney,

        Defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal should have been granted, where the evidence presented at trial showed, at the most, an ambiguous touch from which a jury would have to speculate to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that its purpose was for sexual arousal or gratification. State v. Brown,

        Testimony by the victim about uncharged acts that were committed against her by the defendant was held admissible. State v. Gomes,

       <p>
        The evidence was more than sufficient for a jury to convict the defendant of second-degree molestation while acquitting him on first-degree molestation charges, since the victim provided vivid descriptions of the acts constituting second-degree molestation but could not remember specific events relating to the first-degree molestation counts. State v. Allessio,

        Trial court properly denied defendant’s motions for a judgment of acquittal, R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 29, and for a new trial, R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 33, following defendant’s conviction of second-degree child molestation pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37-8.3.
        Defendant’s deliberate act of fondling his 10 year old stepdaughter could not be characterized as accidental and could reasonably be construed as intended by defendant for the purposes of sexual arousal or gratification, and therefore constituted sexual conduct as defined by R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37-1(7). State v. Tracy,

        Family court did not err in finding defendant juvenile guilty of second-degree child molestation sexual assault. The family court’s finding that the victim was a credible witness was rationally supported by competent evidence; the victim was able to testify about three different events, and the inconsistencies in her testimony were insufficient to raise a reasonable doubt with respect to the State’s case.

        Where the victim’s birth date clearly made the victim 14 years of age or younger at the time of the alleged offense and two witnesses credibly testified that defendant intentionally touched the victim’s naked buttocks with his penis, contact that could reasonably be construed as intended to be for the purposes of sexual arousal, gratification, or assault, the trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial.

P. 16(a)(8) by not turning the evidence over until the second day of trial; the supplemental answer to discovery presented to defendant on the second day of trial indicated the State intended to produce evidence of alleged sexual contact in a shower between defendant and the victim, defendant’s teenage daughter, despite the original information package containing no mention of any alleged contact.

        Trial justice did not abuse her discretion in denying defendant’s motion for new trial, because the trial justice assessed the complainant’s credibility and found the complainant to be a witness worthy of belief, found that defendant offered no compelling reason for overturning the trial justice’s credibility determination, and the trial justice agreed with the jury’s finding and clearly articulated a reason for doing so.

        Where evidence from other accusers was admitted at a prisoner’s child molestation trial, the prisoner’s federal habeas petition was properly denied because the prisoner failed to exhaust the claim that the admission of prior bad acts evidence violated the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments, and the claim failed on the merits since the state court’s approval of the introduction of the prior bad acts evidence was well within the universe of plausible evidentiary rulings.

        In view of a child’s multiple identifications of defendant as the man who had entered her bedroom and touched her vagina, his fingerprints being found on package of gum she said he left in her room, and his admissions that he was familiar with the location of her home and that he had purchased the same brand of gum, the evidence was sufficient to establish that he violated his probation.

        In a prosecution for first- and second-degree child molestation, the trial court properly denied defendant’s motion for a new trial, as it independently assessed the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, explicitly found that the complaining witness was credible and honest, and then determined that it would have reached the same result as the jury.

        Trial court properly denied defendant’s motion for a new trial after he was convicted of multiple counts of first- and second-degree child molestation, because its determination that the testimony of the victim and other State witnesses was credible while defendant’s testimony was not was entitled to deference and was not clearly wrong.

        Trial court did not err in admitting evidence of defendant’s touching a child victim’s sister because the evidence was non-remote and sufficiently similar to the charged offenses, was relevant to show defendant’s specific intent to sexually gratify, was reasonably necessary to support the victim’s credibility, and defendant waived the adequacy of the trial court’s cautionary instruction by not raising an objection prior to the jury’s deliberations.

        Defendant was not entitled to a new trial as to convictions for first-degree child molestation and second-degree child molestation because (1) the victim’s testimony was found sufficient, without corroborating testimony and defendant’s confession, to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt, (2) the prosecutor was admonished for comments about defendant looking at counsel while testifying, and (3) defendant’s limiting instruction on the issue was given.

        Trial court did not err by denying defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal because the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction of second-degree child molestation where the six-year-old victim testified that on the night of the incident she woke up, felt something on her vagina, and saw defendant standing at her bed. Her mother’s testimony corroborated the victim’s statements and defendant told a detective that he touched the victim’s vagina. State v. Armour,

        Juvenile was properly adjudicated as a delinquent for engaging in second-degree child molestation sexual assault because the evidence showed that the juvenile entered the room where the victim was sleeping on two occasions and touched the victim on the second occasion by placing the juvenile’s fingers over the victim’s vagina and underwear for the purpose of the juvenile’s sexual gratification.

        Each count of the petition charging defendant minor with first-degree child molestation necessarily included a charge on the lesser-included offense of second-degree child molestation. There was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the contact between defendant and his victims could be reasonably construed as intended by defendant to be for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or assault.

        Trial justice conducted the proper three-step analysis in passing on defendant’s motion for a new trial and properly denied it, in connection with defendant’s conviction of first and second-degree child molestation; the minor victim’s younger brother’s testimony corroborated the victim’s testimony, the trial justice concluded that there was no way they fabricated the accusations, and defendant’s various arguments essentially amounted to nothing more than a disagreement with the trial justice’s assessment of witness credibility and the weight of the evidence.

        Although the minor victim did not explicitly offer testimony that defendant’s hand touched her vagina in describing every occasion of sexual assault, the victim’s testimony on certain counts sufficiently referred back to an earlier assault in that defendant was “doing the same thing as the other times” and created a nexus between her testimony and the body part delineated in the statute, her genital area.

        In a case in which defendant was convicted of one count of first-degree sexual assault and three counts of second-degree child molestation, defendant’s motion for a new trial was properly denied because the trial justice stated that reasonable minds could differ as to what the verdict should be; the trial justice did not overlook the evidence of the victim’s potential motive for testifying as she did or the evidence that her poor relationship with defendant started only after he allegedly violated her confidence; and the trial justice did not overlook the lack of independent evidence as there was no requirement of independent corroboration for sex offense cases.

        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the victim’s testimony that defendant sexually assaulted her over 100 times over the course of three years because the testimony was highly probative of defendant’s lewd disposition toward the victim and was indicative of a common opportunity, intent, and plan with the offense for which defendant was being tried, child molestation.

        The trial court did not improperly consider in a motion to reduce sentence the defendant’s exercise of his right to stand trial or his corollary right to hold the state to its burden of proving his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt through the presentation of testimony from the child victim, since the defendant forced the child to testify about the molestation in open court by exercising his right to stand trial and by presenting false testimony to the court in the hopes of escaping conviction and punishment, and had indicated his intention to appeal while knowing full well that what the little girl said from the stand was absolutely true.

        Defendant’s appeal from the denial of his R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35 motion to correct an illegal sentence was denied and dismissed where, on each count of second-degree child molestation sexual assault, defendant was sentenced to concurrent terms of 15 years, six of which were to be served with the remaining nine years being suspended; defendant’s sentences were clearly permitted and authorized by R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37-8.4. State v. Murray,

        Because defendant’s sentence for second-degree child molestation was clearly within the limits of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37-8.4, it was not illegal; therefore, because defendant’s second motion to reduce the sentence was filed many months after the expiration of the statutory 120-day time limit in R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35(a), it was untimely. State v. Elliott,

        Defendant’s sentence for second-degree child molestation of 20 years, with 15 years to be served at the Adult Correctional Institutions and the other five years suspended, did not constituted cruel and unusual punishment under U.S. Const. amend. VIII or R.I. Const. art. 1, § 8 because the sentence fell within the range set out in R.I. Gen.

        An interpretation of this section which would allow access to redacted copies of all court documents or records in child molestation sexual assault cases assumes incorrectly that a child victim possesses a legitimate privacy interest only in his or her name or other identifying information, and an interpretation which would bar inspection of any record that contains a reference to the victim’s name or identity impermissibly restricts the right of access to information on criminal prosecutions.

        In a case in which defendant was convicted of one count of first-degree sexual assault and three counts of second-degree child molestation, defendant’s motion for a new trial was properly denied because the trial justice stated that reasonable minds could differ as to what the verdict should be; the trial justice did not overlook the evidence of the victim’s potential motive for testifying as she did or the evidence that her poor relationship with defendant started only after he allegedly violated her confidence; and the trial justice did not overlook the lack of independent evidence as there was no requirement of independent corroboration for sex offense cases.

      In any action under this chapter involving a child victim age fourteen (14) years or under or a victim sixty-five (65) years or older, the court and the attorney general’s office shall take appropriate action to ensure a speedy trial to minimize the length of time the victim must endure the stress of involvement in the proceeding. In ruling on any motion or request for a delay or continuance of proceedings, the court shall consider any adverse impact the delay or continuance may have on the well-being of the victim or witness. This provision establishes a right to a speedy trial to the victim and shall not be construed as creating any additional rights to the defendant.

      If a defendant who is charged with the crime of sexual assault intends to introduce proof that the complaining witness has engaged in sexual activities with other persons, he or she shall give notice of that intention to the court and the attorney for the state. The notice shall be given prior to the introduction of any evidence of that fact; it shall be given orally out of the hearing of spectators and, if the action is being tried by a jury, out of the hearing of the jurors. Upon receiving the notice, the court shall order the defendant to make a specific offer of the proof that he or she intends to introduce in support of this issue. The offer of proof, and all arguments relating to it, shall take place outside the hearing of spectators and jurors. The court shall then rule upon the admissibility of the evidence offered.

        Even if a United States Supreme Court decision stating the findings necessary to allow the victim to testify outside of the defendant’s presence stated a new rule, that rule did not apply retroactively to defendant’s trial because that decision did not prohibit the criminalization of, or punishment for, the acts of which defendant was convicted, nor did it alter the understanding of bedrock procedural elements essential to the fairness of a proceeding. Taylor v. Wall,

        When the testimony of defendant’s victim was presented by videotape, the trial court’s findings that the victim unequivocally would suffer unreasonable and unnecessary mental and emotional harm if required to testify in defendant’s presence satisfied the requirements of a United States Supreme Court decision issued subsequent to the denial of defendant’s direct appeal.

        State had no basis whatsoever to point to R.I.Gen. Laws § 11-37-13.2(a), in seeking an order to close the courtroom in a child sexual assault prosecution; the statute provided for alternate means for relieving child rape victims from the trauma associated with facing their alleged abusers in a courtroom, however, closing the courtroom was not among them. The statute did not apply because the child testified at trial, not outside the courtroom, as provided for by § 11-37-13.2(a). State v. Barkmeyer,

        Although R.I. Gen.

        Even if they had been properly preserved, a registrant’s constitutional challenges to the registrant’s sex offender risk-level classification would fail, because the registrant was afforded a meaningful hearing and failed to demonstrate that his right to procedural due process was violated. Furthermore, the registrant’s constitutional rights to the presumption of innocence and against double jeopardy were not violated because sex-offender registration did not constitute criminal punishment. DiCarlo v. State,

        Registrant’s challenge to the registrant’s sex offender risk-level classification failed as the Rhode Island Sex Offender Board of Review’s decision was not based solely on underlying facts of the first-degree child molestation charges of which the registrant was acquitted. Looking at the full extent of the material the board set forth as having reviewed—including the registrant’s failure to participate in sex-offender treatment programs and denial of the underlying offense—the board considered numerous factors in making its determination.

        Defendant juvenile, who was adjudicated delinquent for committing second-degree child molestation sexual assault, was properly required to register under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37.1-3(a); the Registration Act is constitutional as applied to juveniles. The confidentiality generally afforded to a juvenile is not absolute; sometimes confidentiality has to give way to other legitimate societal priorities. In re Richard A.,

        Where defendant was convicted in 1994 for a 1993 child molestation sexual assault offense, and the statutes were subsequently amended in 1996, 1997, and 2003 extending the duration of a defendant’s duty to register as a sex offender and increasing the penalty for registration violations, defendant’s failure-to-notify convictions in 2007, 2009, and 2010 did not run afoul of the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions. The duration of defendant’s duty to register was merely a condition attached to a civil, nonpunitive regulatory measure, not the imposition of retroactive punishment. State v. Gibson,

        Trial justice appropriately applied the plain language of this section in determining that she had no discretion and that defendant, a juvenile, was required to register as a sex offender based on the trial justice’s determination that this was not a case of willing sexual exploration between curious adolescents but there was coercion, manipulation, and an abuse of trust making the conduct criminal apart from the victims’ ages. In re B.H.,

        Defendant’s statutory duty to register as a sex offender ran for 10 years from the expiration of defendant’s sentence, rather than for life; while the registration statute in place at the time of defendant’s conviction governed defendant’s duty to register, the current statute, § 11-37.1-4, controlled that duty’s duration (case remanded for further factfinding).

        Superior court magistrate did not err when ruling that external factors warranted a deviation between the risk level indicated by the objective tests and the ultimate finding of the Sex Offender Board of Review because the Board thoroughly considered many of the Sex Offender Risk of Re-Offense Assessment Factors in combination with the validated risk assessment tools, and although the Board did make some rather conclusory findings, it nevertheless properly relied upon a range of materials to formulate its decision; the Board is entitled to utilize additional materials and documentation to conduct its risk assessment in order to adequately determine an individual’s risk to the community.

        Language of the Sexual Offender Registration and Community Notification Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37.1-6, paired with the Sexual Offender Community Notification Guidelines, suggests that a sexual offender assessment should not take place in a vacuum or solely rest on the results of the risk assessment tools; the classification of an individual’s future risk of sexual recidivism is not a one-size-fits-all application. State v. Dennis,

        Registrant’s challenge to the registrant’s sex offender risk-level classification failed as the Rhode Island Sex Offender Board of Review’s decision was not based solely on underlying facts of the first-degree child molestation charges of which the registrant was acquitted. Looking at the full extent of the material the board set forth as having reviewed—including the registrant’s failure to participate in sex-offender treatment programs and denial of the underlying offense—the board considered numerous factors in making its determination. DiCarlo v. State,
        <cite class="ocri">
         212 A.3d 1191
        </cite>

       <p>
        Even if they had been properly preserved, a registrant’s constitutional challenges to the registrant’s sex offender risk-level classification would fail, because the registrant was afforded a meaningful hearing and failed to demonstrate that his right to procedural due process was violated. Furthermore, the registrant’s constitutional rights to the presumption of innocence and against double jeopardy were not violated because sex-offender registration did not constitute criminal punishment.

        Even if they had been properly preserved, a registrant’s due process challenges to the registrant’s sex offender risk-level classification would fail, because the registrant was afforded a meaningful hearing and failed to demonstrate a violation. DiCarlo v. State,

        Registrant’s challenge to the registrant’s sex offender risk-level classification failed as the Rhode Island Sex Offender Board of Review’s decision was not based solely on underlying facts of first-degree child molestation charges of which the registrant was acquitted. Looking at the full extent of the material the board set forth as having reviewed—including the registrant’s failure to participate in sex-offender treatment programs and denial of the underlying offense—the board considered numerous factors in making its determination.

        While R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37.1-15(a)(2) could be considered unconstitutional in some circumstances, insofar as it granted the Superior Court discretion to deny a sexual offender the right to a meaningful hearing as a part of judicial review of any risk level classification, there was no constitutional violation in the instant action, because defendant was granted a meaningful hearing. State v. Germane,
        <cite class="ocri">
         971 A.2d 555
        </cite>
        ,
        <cite class="ocri">

        (R.I. 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37.1-15(a)(2), as applied to defendant’s case, did not violate defendant’s right to substantive due process, because the Sex Offender Board of Review did, at a basic level, consider all the factors required by the guidelines in assessing appellant’s risk of re-offense. State v. Germane,
        <cite class="ocri">
         971 A.2d 555
        </cite>
        ,
        <cite class="ocri">
         2009 R.I. LEXIS 68

       </p>
       <p>
        R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37.1-15 did not violate the prohibition against ex post facto laws, because the sex offender registration process was a civil regulatory process. State v. Germane,
        <cite class="ocri">
         971 A.2d 555
        </cite>
        ,

        </cite>
        (R.I. 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the question of whether or not the risk of reoffense of an individual sex offender was left open to judicial determination on the basis of the proof offered by the alleged offender and/or the state, the legislatively mandated presumption was not permissibly “conclusive,” but was rebuttable, and R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37.1-15 did not violate the separation of powers clause. State v. Germane,
        <cite class="ocri">

        Defendant was afforded a meaningful hearing to review his classification as a Level III, high risk sexual offender under the Sexual Offender Registration and Community Notification Act, and he failed to show that his right to procedural due process was violated because the superior court magistrate considered all written memoranda and exhibits submitted prior to the hearing, and both attorneys were granted the opportunity to develop their arguments and present further evidence at the hearing; defendant agreed to proceed on the basis of written memoranda and oral argument, and his attorney raised no objection to the scope of the hearing, nor did she inform the magistrate that she intended to call any witnesses to the stand. State v. Dennis,
        <cite class="ocri">

       <p>
        Even if they had been properly preserved, a registrant’s due process challenges to the registrant’s sex offender risk-level classification would fail, because the registrant was afforded a meaningful hearing and failed to demonstrate a violation. DiCarlo v. State,
        <cite class="ocri">

       </p>
       <p>
        Registrant’s challenge to the registrant’s sex offender risk-level classification failed as the Rhode Island Sex Offender Board of Review’s decision was not based solely on underlying facts of first-degree child molestation charges of which the registrant was acquitted. Looking at the full extent of the material the board set forth as having reviewed—including the registrant’s failure to participate in sex-offender treatment programs and denial of the underlying offense—the board considered numerous factors in making its determination.

The increased penalty was already in effect before defendant’s failures to notify occurred, and the failures to notify were offenses separate and apart from the second-degree child molestation sexual assault of 1993, rendering them insufficiently annexed to that crime as to trigger an ex post facto violation.

        For a defendant who was convicted before the passage of § 11-37.1 et seq., language in R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37.1-18 preserves defendant’s duty to register as a sex offender under the former law, not its duration. The duration of the duty to register as a sex offender is governed by § 11-37.1-4.

        Under this section, a person who was charged with child molestation while former § 11-37-16 was in effect, but who was not convicted until after passage of the new act in 1996, was required to register as a sex offender pursuant to the requirements in effect at the time he was charged.

        Defendant, a person convicted of sexual assault and incarcerated before July 1, 1992, but released after that date, was not required to register as a sexual offender pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-37-16, because he was not in the pool of individuals upon whom the duty in § 11-37-16(a) was imposed and because § 11-37-16(b) could not be read as broadening the pool of those upon whom duty was imposed, as it instructed officials to inform those offenders to whom § 11-37-16(a) applied of their duty to register.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The word “robbery” when used in statutes has a technical meaning which incorporates all the elements of the common law crime. State v. Domanski,
        <cite class="ocri">
         57 R.I. 500
        </cite>
        ,
        <cite class="ocri">

        ,
        <cite class="ocri">
         1937 R.I. LEXIS 128
        </cite>
        (1937); State v. Robalewski,
        <cite class="ocri">
         418 A.2d 817
        </cite>
        ,
        <cite class="ocri">
         1980 R.I. LEXIS 1717
        </cite>
        (R.I. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although robbery is a statutory offense in Rhode Island, the statute merely incorporates the common law elements of the offense. State v. Innis,
        <cite class="ocri">
         433 A.2d 646
        </cite>
        ,
        <cite class="ocri">

         1982 U.S. LEXIS 1754
        </cite>
        (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the statute establishing the penalties for robbery fails to set forth the elements of the crime, the common law definition of “the felonious taking of money or goods of any value from the person of another, or in his presence, against his will, by violence, or putting him in fear,” is applicable. State v. Rodriquez,
        <cite class="ocri">
         731 A.2d 726
        </cite>
        ,
        <cite class="ocri">
         1999 R.I. LEXIS 141
        </cite>
        (R.I. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the statute does not define robbery, it has been held to incorporate the common-law definition. State v. Robertson,
        <cite class="ocri">
         740 A.2d 330
        </cite>
        ,
        <cite class="ocri">
         1999 R.I. LEXIS 182
        </cite>
        (R.I. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a first-degree robbery case, the trial court’s instruction defining “permanent deprivation of property” to include deprivation for an unreasonable length of time, or the intent to use the property in such a way that the owner would probably be deprived of it, was proper because it was consistent with the definitions of felonious intent to steal used by other common-law jurisdictions. State v. McWilliams,
        <cite class="ocri">
         47 A.3d 251
        </cite>
        ,
        <cite class="ocri">
         2012 R.I. LEXIS 111

        Dual convictions for carrying a dangerous weapon when committing a crime of violence and first-degree robbery did not constitute a double jeopardy violation because each offense included an additional element of proof that was not contained in the other; the jury could have returned a verdict of guilty on the robbery charge based on either defendant’s use of a dangerous weapon or the injury inflicted upon the victim, while the conviction for committing a crime of violence while armed or having available a firearm did not require that the weapon be used or that there be an injury to the victim.

        The admission into evidence of a photograph of the victim grimacing in pain was not prejudical error, since it was introduced to prove that the victim was injured during the robbery, a requirement under this section. In light of the extensive injuries sustained by the victim, it was unlikely that his facial expression evoked the jurors’ passions and resulted in undue prejudice to the defendant. State v.

        Evidence that $100 bill was found in the area where the struggle between defendant and the victim occurred, in the vicinity of other material belonging to defendant, including defendant’s backpack, was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction for first-degree robbery because it permitted the jury to infer that defendant took the money defendant had previously given the victim, a cab driver, after defendant shot the victim.

        Because defendant participated in a coordinated attack on a defenseless man that began with an ambush of the victim’s vehicle and ended with a robbery and severe beating, based on the totality of the evidence, the jury reasonably could conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant entered into an agreement with others to commit the crime of robbery.

        In an armed robbery case, as a detective did not give his opinion on the ability of another witness to describe defendant accurately, but was asked to compare independently the physical description given in dispatches with defendant’s actual appearance, a task that was common to his responsibilities as a police officer, his testimony was not impermissible bolstering; therefore, the trial court properly denied defendant’s motion for a new trial.

        Where defendant argued that the victims’ identifications of him at trial as the man who robbed them at gunpoint were unreliable and not substantial enough to prove his guilt, as the trial court reviewed all the testimony, including cross-examination designed to weaken the credibility of the victims’ identifications, and agreed with the jury that there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant beyond a reasonable doubt, its decision to deny his motion for a new trial was deferred to on appeal.

        Trial court properly convicted defendant of second-degree robbery and denied his motion for a new trial because an eyewitness testified that he got a good look at defendant when he stopped at a driveway where defendant was standing under a light, identified defendant within one or two days when the photo array was shown to him, and made an unequivocal in-court identification of defendant.

        Juvenile was properly adjudicated delinquent for first-degree robbery because (1) the State produced sufficient evidence of the crime’s corpus delicti to permit admission of the juvenile’s confession, and (2) other circumstantial evidence also demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the juvenile perpetrated the crime.

        Although the victim did not identify defendant in an initial photo array, her identification of defendant was sufficient because a Facebook search by her of a name provided by the Attorney General’s office yielded profiles and photos that she scrolled through before seeing one with a familiar face that was defendant. Moreover, at trial, the victim emphasized that her in-court identification of defendant was based on his height, how big he was, and his eyes. State v. Johnson,

        Victim’s testimony as to the actions and statements of defendant and his accomplices led to a reasonable inference that the gun used in a robbery was operable; the victim testified that she was in fear—as demonstrated by her question to an accomplice about whether he thought the others involved in the robbery were going to kill her, defendant threatened to return if she called the police, and the gun was pointed at her for the duration of the incident.

        Because the risk of bodily injury that underlies the more severe treatment of robbery is present when the item that is being snatched is attached to the body or clothing of the victim, the snatching of two chains from the neck of the victim constituted sufficient force to satisfy the denial of defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal.

        Defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal was properly denied as sufficient evidence of force supported defendant’s robbery conviction under R.I. Gen.

       Every person who shall unlawfully seize a motor vehicle from its lawful owner, lessor, or occupant by use or threat of use of a dangerous weapon against the owner, lessor, or occupant resulting in serious bodily injury, as defined in § 11-5-10.2, shall be guilty of first degree robbery and shall be imprisoned for not less than ten (10) years and may be imprisoned for life, or fined not more than fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000), or both. In all such cases, the justice imposing sentence shall impose a minimum sentence of ten (10) years imprisonment and may only impose a sentence less than the minimum if he or she finds that substantial and compelling circumstances exist which justify imposition of the alternative sentence. That finding may be based upon the character and background of the defendant, the cooperation of the defendant with law enforcement authorities, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and/or the nature and quality of the evidence presented at trial. If a sentence which is less than imprisonment for a term of ten (10) years is imposed, the trial justice shall set forth on the record the circumstances which he or she found as justification for imposition of the lesser sentence. A person sentenced to prison for violation of this subsection shall not be eligible for parole until at least one-half (1/2) of the sentence has been served in prison.

        Although a jury found defendant guilty of entering a building with the intent to commit larceny, R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-8-3, but not guilty of larceny in excess of $ 500, R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-41-1, the verdicts were not inconsistent because even though an employee saw defendant carrying something out of a business, which was closed for a holiday, and two laptops were missing from the business, the jury could have found defendant not guilty on the actual physical possession or larceny of the item because defendant was not found with the laptops in his possession.

        There was sufficient evidence to show that defendant intended to steal $7,200 mistakenly given to him by a credit union teller who misread a check the defendant presented for cashing, where there was evidence that defendant knew an extra $7,200 was being given to him and he silently accepted and walked out of the credit union with the overpayment.

        Creditor’s larceny claim failed because the creditor failed to prove that at the time of the sale the debtor intended to “wrongfully and permanently deprive” the creditor of the $4,000 he paid for the motorcycle when, despite the misrepresentation he made to the creditor about having to pay off a loan to obtain the title, the debtor did make some post-sale efforts in this regard, albeit unsuccessfully.

        Shoplifting is defined in the same manner as the word “steal,” i.e., “to wrongfully and with the intent of committing a felony or crime thereby, take and carry away the property of another,” with the additional element that the goods must be taken from a retail establishment.

        The elements to be proven in order to establish the offense of embezzlement are (1) that defendant was entrusted with the property for a specific use, (2) that he came into possession of the property in a lawful manner, often as a result of his employment, and (3) that defendant intended to appropriate and convert the property to his own use and permanently deprive that person of the use. State v. Oliveira,

        Proof of the employer’s ownership of the property is not an essential element of the crime of embezzlement. State v. Oliveira,

        Even though indictment alleged that the money embezzled was “the property of the city of Providence,” the issue of ownership was not an essential element of the crime to be proven in order to sustain a conviction for embezzlement. State v. Oliveira,

        Defendant, a police officer, who offered to take an allegedly stolen minibike to the police station for storage but who instead discarded the minibike behind a dumpster, thinking that it would never be claimed, was properly convicted of embezzlement and fraudulent conversion under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-41-3. When the officer discarded the property, he had treated it as his own; it did not matter that he did not benefit or gain personally from his actions. State v. Lough,

        State did not make out a prima facie case of embezzlement against the defendant, who was employed as director of maintenance for city, and who ordered delivery of carpeting, ceiling tiles, and two steel fire-door units valued at approximately $1,200 to an environmental testing company which in turn rendered services to the city. Although the items were ordered by the defendant and charged to the school department, the defendant secured from the testing company training services for his employees in the removal of hazardous substances and four steel doors, valued at significantly more than $1,200. There was nothing contained in the information package which indicated that the defendant converted the property to his own use. State v. Powers,

        Evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction of obtaining property by false pretenses because it showed that defendant’s promise to build the leadership building, the construction of which was never completed, constituted a false pretense, through which defendant obtained almost $550,000 from the victim.

       <p>
        In a prosecution for obtaining money by false pretenses, the defendant’s motion for acquittal was denied since the defendant was found to have intentionally utilized token or “straw” borrowers in an effort to circumvent the lending limits at certain credit unions, which he had exceeded or nearly exceeded, and since his deceptive actions resulted in the transfer by them of their money. The defendant’s exculpatory testimony, explaining his motives and denying any intent to defraud, were not relevant at the time of his motion under the judgment-of-acquittal standard. State v.

        Defendant’s conviction under R.I. Gen.

Immediately upon stopping the person the library employee shall identify himself or herself and state the reason for stopping the person.

In no case shall the detention be for a period of more than one-half (1/2) hour. The detention must be accomplished in a reasonable manner without unreasonable restraints or excessive force, and may take place only on the premises of the library where the alleged crime occurred. Library premises includes the interior of a building, structure, or other enclosure in which a library facility is located, the exterior appurtenances to any building, structure, or enclosure, and the land on which the building, structure, or other enclosure is located. Any person so stopped by an employee or agent of a library shall promptly identify himself or herself by name and address. Once placed under detention, no other information shall be required of the person and no written and/or signed statement shall be elicited from him or her until a police officer has taken him or her into custody.

Should the person detained refuse to surrender the item for examination, a limited and reasonable search may be conducted.

        Conviction of shoplifting, R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-41-20, was supported by sufficient evidence because a supervisor testified that defendant took a retention wire from one box of wheel covers, put it in a second box, and paid for the box with the extra retention wire; if defendant had wanted to legally obtain a fifth retention wire, he would have had to purchase another box at the full price of $ 11.66. Clearly a box containing only three retention wires lost some, if not all, of its value. State v. Cardin,

        Trial court erroneously instructed the jury on the common law rule, rather than Rhode Island law, relating to the shopkeeper’s privilege to temporarily detain a shopper; the shopper did not have to be charged with shoplifting for the store to be protected by R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-41-21(c), but, under § 11-41-21(c), to have the privilege, the store or its agent had to be actually observe the shopper shoplifting and not just have reasonable suspicion. Cruz v.

        Rhode Island Supreme Court does not require that a plaintiff need be charged with shoplifting for a merchant to be protected under the R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-41-21 privilege. Cruz v. Johnson,

        Privilege to detain suspected shoplifters exists only if, as R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-41-21 indicates, a merchant or its agent observes any person concealing or attempting to conceal merchandise on his person or amongst his or her belongings or amongst the person or belongings of another R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-41-21(b). Cruz v. Johnson,

        Merchant’s belief about the plaintiff’s shoplifting involvement is irrelevant to assert the R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-41-21 privilege because § 11-41-21 first requires an observation. Cruz v. Johnson,

        Judgment in favor of alleged shoplifter who was forced to sign a waiver form by a supermarket prior to being allowed to leave the store, which form contained the statement that she admitted to the wrongful conduct of misappropriating the merchandise, went beyond the allowable language of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-41-21 and accordingly, there was no waiver of the shoplifter’s right to sue for false imprisonment and coercion.
        The supermarket’s objections to instructions by the trial court as to the unlawfulness of the waiver form could not be raised on appeal where no objection was made on the trial level, pursuant to R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 51(b). Bourque v. Stop &amp; Shop Cos.,

That restitution shall include, but not be limited to, the value of the historic stone wall or portions of it, the reasonable value of any labor and other materials necessary to repair and/or return the wall to the condition it was in prior to the theft, and any other reasonable expenses that, in the discretion of the sentencing judge, are necessary to do justice in disposing of the case. This section is in addition to any other sanctions a sentencing judge may impose in his or her discretion.

        Trial court abused its discretion in precluding an expert’s testimony on the subject of historic stone walls because there was sufficient evidence to allow a reasonable juror to find the expert’s methods were grounded in valid and reliable science and any lack of formalism in the peer review of the expert’s theories was for the jury to weigh; the dispute concerned a neighbor’s claim that an abutting landowner destroyed a stone wall on the neighbor’s property.

        An instruction concerning the offense of extortion as explained to the grand jury by the prosecutor, who told the grand jury that “no proof of threat or force or duress” was required, was arguably a viable interpretation of this section and, absent any egregious, flagrant, or overbearing conduct on behalf of the prosecutor, the indictment returned by the grand jury should not have been dismissed.

        In determining whether the natural purport and effect of words was to convey a threat, it would be proper to receive evidence of any circumstance, even if criminal in nature, provided it was connected with the offense charged in such a way that it tends either to establish an intent, motive, plan, design of scheme.

        Defendant’s letters to his ex-wife included statements that clearly evinced defendant’s subjective intent both to harm his ex-wife and to compel her to pay him money or reconcile against her will; as such, they constituted genuine threats in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-42-2 and were unprotected by the First Amendment. Thus, there was sufficient evidence about the credibility of defendant’s threats to support defendant’s convictions for extortion and blackmail. State v. Grayhurst,

        Defendant’s contention that he was placed twice in jeopardy by being prosecuted for extortion pursuant to this section subsequent to a conviction for assault and battery pursuant to § 11-5-3 was without merit, since assault and battery, which is the intentional and unlawful application of the slightest force to the person of another, and extortion, which consists of a verbal threat to place a victim in peril of actual bodily harm accompanied by an intent to compel that victim to do an act against his will, require proof of different elements and hence do not satisfy the “same evidence” test applied by the court. State v. Davis,

        Double jeopardy was found in a particular case where, in order to prove both extortion and assault with intent to rob, the state had to demonstrate the identical elements of an intentional threat to the victim that placed him in fear of actual bodily harm, the purpose of which was to force him to give the defendant money, and proof of no additional fact was required to establish both crimes.

       <p>
        Conviction for extortion and blackmail under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-42-2 requires proof of both a threat and of intent to force someone to act against his or her will, and unique to a conviction for violating a no-contact order is the requirement that a no-contact order be in place; thus, the two crimes require proof of separate and additional facts that the other does not.

        Irrespective of how the crime of extortion may be defined in other states, the only requirement for establishment of the crime under the statute is that the specified threat be made with intent to extort. State v. Mancini,
        <cite class="ocri">

       <p>
        In applying this section, the focus should be on the defendant and his or her subjective intent as demonstrated by his or her conduct and by the words he or she used; how the incident would be perceived by a reasonable person is not an element of the crime of extortion. State v. Price,
        <cite class="ocri">

        The requirement of a threat of injury to the person is ambiguous and being penal in nature requires narrow construction and does not include danger to reputation. State v. Simmons,

       <p>
        The crime of extortion consists of two basic elements: a verbal threat to place a victim in peril of bodily harm or of harm to his property, accompanied by an intent to compel the victim to do an act against his will. State v. Sabitoni,

        R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-42-4 sets out a single offense, that of threatening a public official, which can take the form of either a threat to that official’s life, or of a threat to that official’s bodily safety; the plain language of § 11-42-4 indicates, therefore, that the General Assembly intended to create only one offense under that statute. Thus, a State’s charge that defendant threatened public officials with death was charge of violating § 11-42-4, and the trial justice was not obligated to instruct the jurors that they could convict defendant only if they found he had threatened public officials with death.

        Trial court properly convicted defendant of willful trespass as a lesser-included offense of breaking and entering a dwelling because defendant’s arguments were not properly before the Supreme Court of Rhode Island where defense counsel explicitly suggested that the trial justice look at the facts before him through the lens of the willful trespass statute rather than the breaking and entering statute, which the State had initially invoked, and the trial justice never ultimately ruled on the defendant’s motion to dismiss the breaking and entering charge.

       “This act revises chapter 11-45 of the general laws by repealing sections 11-45-1 through 11-45-11 and replacing them with section 11-45-1 entitled, ‘Disorderly conduct.’ The provisions originally contained in chapter 11-45 covered vagrancy, drunkards, disorderly conduct and a plethora of minor offenses and status crimes many of which have their origins in English legislation of the feudal era when vagrancy laws served both to deter serfs from leaving their lords as well as to control scarce labor in the aftermath of the plagues that swept England in the fourteenth century. Subsequently these statutes were expanded and used to control wandering bands of robbers as well as beggars. For a fuller description, see text to accompany Tent. Draft No. 13, Model Penal Code 60-65 (1961). Similar provisions were adopted in some form or other by most of the American states. The provisions contained in sections 11-45-1 through 11-45-11 are fairly typical. In a series of relatively recent decisions, the United States supreme court has held restrictions similar to those contained in chapter 11-45 to be unconstitutionally vague as well as to infringe rights of free speech and assembly.

       (1960). As a result, Rhode Island has not for some time had an enforceable law dealing with a variety of activities which are generally classified as disorderly conduct.
      </p>
      <p>
       “This act is designed to fill that gap in Rhode Island law by prohibiting six specific types of conduct, which, if carefully delineated, can be regulated by the state. The statute has been drafted so as to explicitly define the prohibited conduct while not intruding upon constitutionally protected activities. Essentially, the act prescribes types of conduct which are breaches of the peace or create serious nuisances. For example, subsections (a) and (c) are intended to prevent or to punish violent behavior which the state has an interest in controlling under its obligations to maintain the public peace. See e.g., Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire,
       <cite class="ocri">
        315 U.S. 568
       </cite>
       ,
       <cite class="ocri">
        62 S. Ct. 766
       </cite>
       ,
       <cite class="ocri">
        86 L. Ed. 1031
       </cite>
       (1942). In addition, the statute seeks to control conduct which is essentially a nuisance, although not leading to an imminent breach of peace. Examples of these are found in subdivisions (b) and (f).
      </p>
      <p>
       “With the exception of verbal expressions ‘which by this very utterance . . . tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace,’ the act does not attempt to regulate or punish other varieties of, so-called, ‘offensive language’. Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, supra at 572. The commission deliberated at length over the question of whether in the light of recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court it is reasonably possible to draft a constitutionally valid statute dealing with this problem. After a review of the various authorities, it was the commission’s considered judgment that, other than the prohibition contained in subdivision (c) against ‘fighting word’, it is not feasible to draft legislation dealing with other types of offensive utterance.

       “By repealing chapter 11-45 of the general laws, section 11-45-2 was also repealed. Contained in that section were certain procedural guidelines for the prosecution of nonsupport cases. Those provisions were transferred to chapter 11-2 and the vague provisions of ‘habitual drunkard’ was deleted from section 11-2-1.”

        Since defendant could appreciate that throwing furniture around his residence during a violent disagreement with his wife, in which he threatened to destroy the home if he did not get his way, was prohibited conduct that would subject him to arrest, prosecution and, potentially, a domestic abuse restraining order, this section was not unconstitutionally vague.

        Disorderly conduct statute was not void for vagueness and did not prohibit arrest and prosecution where defendant’s alleged disorderly conduct occurred inside his home; the statute put him on notice that he violated that statute if he intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly engaged in fighting, threatening, violent, or tumultuous behavior without regard to the location where that happened, and, thus, defendant could appreciate that throwing furniture around his residence during a violent argument with his wife, in which he threatened to destroy the home if he did not get his way, was prohibited conduct.

        State did not have to prove that defendant’s behavior occurred in a public place or disturbed another member of the public to prove disorderly conduct under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-45-1(a)(1). State v. Hesford,

        Where the trial justice found the State’s witnesses credible, and that defendant struck the victim and engaged in other tumultuous behavior, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction for disorderly conduct. State v. Hesford,

        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of domestic simple assault and domestic disorderly conduct because neither the purported inconsistencies in the victim’s testimony nor any contradictory evidence undermined defendant’s convictions as the victim told the responding officer that defendant had beat her and kicked her, punched her, and stomped on her; the officer observed bruises on her forehead, face, and chin area; defendant admitted to the officer that he had hit and punched the victim after she had slapped him; and an emergency room physician testified that the victim presented with an ear contusion and lacerations, hand contusion, ankle abrasion, and a blow to the head, and that she was discharged after receiving 10 sutures.

        Where defendant, convicted under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-45-1, contended that his speech constituted protected speech under the First Amendment and not “fighting words”, the trial court did not err in denying his motion for a new trial after finding that the troopers’ testimony was credible, defendant directed his speech at the two troopers, the troopers were concerned and alarmed by defendant’s words, and defendant was not a mere bystander or uninvolved in the troopers’ immediate purpose in coming to the scene.

      It is hereby declared to be the policy of the state to prohibit unreasonable, excessive and annoying noise levels from all sources subject to its police power. At certain levels, low frequency sound (between 100-20 cps) when substantially amplified, often referred to as sub-woofer frequency, can be extremely penetrating, disturbing and poses a danger to the health and safety of the individual using equipment creating the sound, and to other individuals in the immediate area from which the sound is being generated. The noise being generated may originate from radios, CD players, DVD players, tape players, televisions and other audio-producing equipment.

        Since it was the Rhode Island General Assembly’s clear and unambiguous intent, manifested just as lucidly in R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-5 and R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-2(4), that Rhode Island law governed whether a foreign conviction qualified as a predicate “crime of violence” under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-5, the use of defendant’s Arizona arson conviction under Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 13-1703 as a predicate offense under R.I. § 11-47-5 was proper as the mens rea requirement in Arizona exceeded the
        <i>
         mens rea

        requirement in R.I. Gen. Laws 11-4-3 and thus was merely superfluous. State v. Menard,

        Defendant violated the conditions of probation after a conviction for a crime of violence by possession of a replica of an antique revolver with a damaged cylinder, which was a firearm since the cylinder on the revolver could be replaced in a matter of minutes without difficulty and the revolver was thus readily convertible to expel a projectile.

        Defendant’s convictions satisfied the Blockburger different-crimes test (separate elements of murder and using a firearm), and even if the test was not satisfied, the legislature clearly intended consecutive sentences under R.I.

        Where two crimes of violence — robbery and assault with a dangerous weapon — were committed at the same time as part of the same criminal transaction, the state could not single out the robbery as the underlying crime of violence for a charge of committing a crime of violence while armed and thereby evade the double-jeopardy violation that would result from using the assault charge as the underlying crime of violence.

        Defendant waived an argument that convictions and separate sentences for second-degree murder and carrying a dangerous weapon in the commission of a crime of violence violated double jeopardy guarantees by failing to raise it in a pretrial motion; nonetheless, the court ruled on the merits and held in furtherance of Rodriguez, that the two crimes were separate for double jeopardy purposes as each required an element that the other did not, namely, commission of a murder and the carrying of a dangerous weapon.

       <p>
        Dual convictions for carrying a dangerous weapon when committing a crime of violence and first-degree robbery did not constitute a double jeopardy violation because each offense included an additional element of proof that was not contained in the other; the jury could have returned a verdict of guilty on the robbery charge based on either defendant’s use of a dangerous weapon or the injury inflicted upon the victim, while the conviction for committing a crime of violence while armed or having available a firearm did not require that the weapon be used or that there be an injury to the victim.

        Imposition of two consecutive terms of life imprisonment for first-degree murder and using a firearm while committing a crime of violence resulting in death did not violate Eighth Amendment or R.I. Const. art. I, § 8; the sentence imposed was mandatory and the crime was precisely that type the Legislature intended to address when it provided for a mandatory consecutive life sentence for using a firearm while committing murder. State v. Monteiro,

        R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-3.2(b)(3) and (c), imposing a mandatory consecutive sentence for discharging a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence with death resulting, did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Killers who used firearms during a robbery were not a suspect class, and the legislature could rationally conclude that making penalties harsher for people using a firearm during a robbery which resulted in death would act as a deterrence that would save lives.

        Defendant’s convictions and sentences for using a firearm to commit second-degree murder and second degree murder did not violate double jeopardy because (1) each crime required proof of a fact the other did not, and (2) the legislature intended consecutive sentences under the circumstances.

        Defendant’s consecutive life sentence for using a firearm to commit second-degree murder did not violate the Eighth Amendment or R.I. Const. art. I, § 8 because (1) no violation had been found in the context of first-degree murder, and that holding did not depend on the classification of murder, and (2) the legislature intended the sentence to apply to crimes such as defendant’s.

        Defendant’s convictions satisfied the Blockburger different-crimes test (separate elements of murder and using a firearm), and even if the test was not satisfied, the legislature clearly intended consecutive sentences under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-3.2(c) such that defendant’s sentences did not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy in R.I. Const. art. 1, § 7. State v. Rodriguez,

        Constitutional challenges to the imposition of a mandatory life sentence of imprisonment upon defendant’s conviction for discharge of a firearm while committing a crime of violence resulting in death, in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-3.2, which was to run consecutive to a sentence imposed for his conviction of second-degree murder, were not improper in a R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35 motion, as the sentence was not illegal; the trial court had no discretion but to impose the mandatory, consecutive life sentence in the circumstances. State v. Linde,

        First defendant and second defendant’s contention, that the singular-person language of R.I. Gen.

        In a prosecution for using a firearm while committing a crime of violence, the trial court properly admitted a statement the victim made to police, soon after defendant shot him, to tell his father he loved him, as it tended to establish that he was injured by the discharge of the firearm, and any prejudice to defendant paled in comparison to the impact of seeing the victim testify from a wheelchair about the incidents leading to his permanent paralysis.

        Superior court properly denied defendant’s application for postconviction relief because, inter alia, defendant’s contention that the trial justice erred by sentencing him to life without parole for first-degree murder followed by a consecutive life sentence under § 11-47-3.2—was barred by the doctrine of res judicata in § 10-9.1-8; further, defendant did not file a motion to reduce his sentence under R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 35, and § 11-47-3.2 mandated that his sentence under that statute was to run consecutively to any other sentence imposed. Graham v. State,

        As a reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant possessed the weapon used in the murder and both rounds which hit the victim were fired from the same weapon and from the same direction and that defendant fired those rounds, defendant was not entitled to a judgment of acquittal as to the charges of second-degree murder, discharging a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence resulting in the death of another, and unlicensed possession of a firearm.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The evidence was sufficient to establish the defendant’s constructive possession of a firearm since it was clearly established that the gun was seized from the defendant’s apartment over which he exercised dominion and control. State v. Mastracchio,
        <cite class="ocri">

        </cite>
        (R.I. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since defendant was also convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon in addition to possessing it as a convicted felon, a jury instruction regarding constructive possession was superfluous and harmless. State v. Fisher,
        <cite class="ocri">
         844 A.2d 112

       <p>
        Trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial because there was ample evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that defendant was in constructive possession of a gun found in his girlfriend’s apartment; the testimony reflected that defendant spent considerable time at the apartment, his name was on the mailbox, and the girlfriend testified that she had no experience with or understanding of firearms.

        When the state introduced evidence that the defendant had previously been convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon in order to establish the pending charge of possession of a firearm after conviction of a crime of violence, the trial court was under no obligation to, sua sponte, give an immediate limiting instruction, but properly addressed the matter in his final charge to the jury.

        Since it was the Rhode Island General Assembly’s clear and unambiguous intent, manifested just as lucidly in R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-5 and R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-2(4), that Rhode Island law governed whether a foreign conviction qualified as a predicate “crime of violence” under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-5, the use of defendant’s Arizona arson conviction under Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 13-1703 as a predicate offense under R.I. § 11-47-5 was proper as the mens rea requirement in Arizona exceeded the
        <i>

        Where defendant is charged with carrying a pistol without a license the defendant has the burden of raising the issue of license or justification in the first instance and once the issue has been raised the burden would be upon the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt each and every element of the offense charged. State v. Neary,

        Although § 11-47-27 creates an implication that possession of a handgun in violation of § 11-47-8 constitutes evidence that such possession was unlawful, such a statutory inference does not relieve the state of its constitutional burden to prove that defendant’s possession of the weapon was unlawful. Section 11-47-27 does nothing more than shift the evidentiary burden of production to the defendant, and once the defendant has raised the issue of justification and has satisfied the burden of production, the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant’s possession was unlawful shifts back to the state.

        “Carry” and “possession” involve largely the same legal ramifications. State v. Benevides,
        <cite class="ocri">
         425 A.2d 77
        </cite>
        ,

       <p>
        The essential element of “carry” in this section means an intentional control of the designated object with the knowledge of its nature. State v. Benevides,
        <cite class="ocri">
         425 A.2d 77

       <p>
        The element of possession or carrying is not conditioned on the time that a person has an item under control: knowing or conscious contact with an item, albeit fleeting and momentary, is sufficient to constitute possession or carrying. State v. Benevides,
        <cite class="ocri">

        Evidence sufficiently supported the inference that a discarded gun had been carried by the defendant and discarded by him, and that it was operable until damaged in being discarded. State v. Benevides,

        Evidence was sufficient for a conviction under subsection (c) since the defendant, while a passenger in a van, had in his possession heroin that he later transferred to an informant and, en route to the delivery, he was aware of a gun which was loaded and strategically positioned toward the passenger side of the van. Constructive possession can occur when an individual exercises dominion and control over an object even though it is not within his physical possession. State v. Reyes,

       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-8(a) to establish that defendant had constructive possession of the firearm that was found in a vehicle that was registered to defendant’s girlfriend, because defendant was the only driver of the vehicle who was aware of the gun’s presence, as defendant had admitted to knowledge of the gun’s presence, and defendant’s girlfriend, the only other driver of the vehicle, denied knowledge of the gun’s presence.

        Defendant’s convictions satisfied the Blockburger different-crimes test (separate elements of murder and using a firearm), and even if the test was not satisfied, the legislature clearly intended consecutive sentences under R.I.

        Charge of malicious killing of an animal was properly not severed from a charge of possession of a sawed-off shotgun, when defendant argued the denial of defendant’s motion to sever denied defendant the ability to testify in defense of the first charge due to a risk defendant would be cross-examined to fill a gap in the State’s evidence as to the second charge because defendant did not sufficiently show prejudice, as defendant’s testimony was not required to prove the State’s case as to the second charge, since the State had overwhelming evidence supporting that charge.

        Trial court properly refused to instruct the jury that defendant was not guilty, under R.I. Gen Laws § 11-47-8(a), if he honestly and reasonably believed that he had unloaded the gun before transporting it; defendant’s proposed instruction was legally incorrect, because even if the unloaded requirement was met by defendant’s mistaken belief that such was the case, he could have been convicted of a violation of § 11-47-8(a) on the ground that the gun was not securely wrapped, as was required by R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-9. State v. Keiser,

        As defendant was not under arrest when a police officer handcuffed him and placed him in her cruiser for her own safety, she did not need probable cause to do so; and as he was detained only long enough for her to search his car for weapons, the trial court properly denied his motion to suppress a revolver and ammunition she found in his car.

        Trial court properly denied defendant’s motion to suppress a gun and ammunition seized from his car, as a police officer had a reasonable belief that he might be armed and dangerous based on her observation of loose bullets in his car; his furtive movements and avoidance of eye contact; his positioning of his hands so she could not see them; and her discovery of a knife during a cursory pat-down of his clothing.

        As a reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant possessed the weapon used in the murder and both rounds which hit the victim were fired from the same weapon and from the same direction and that defendant fired those rounds, defendant was not entitled to a judgment of acquittal as to the charges of second-degree murder, discharging a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence resulting in the death of another, and unlicensed possession of a firearm. State v. Reyes,

       <p>
        As an officer found a revolver within reaching distance of defendant, in a vehicle he was operating, and as he had moved toward the area where the gun was later found, the evidence was sufficient to convict him of violating R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-8(a); therefore, the trial court properly denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal. State v. Santos,

Gen Laws § 11-47-8(a), if he honestly and reasonably believed that he had unloaded the gun before transporting it; defendant’s proposed instruction was legally incorrect, because even if the unloaded requirement was met by defendant’s mistaken belief that such was the case, he could have been convicted of a violation of § 11-47-8(a) on the ground that the gun was not securely wrapped, as was required by R.I.

        When viewed in its entirety, the statutory framework of the Firearms Act, R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 11, ch. 47, serves to vindicate an individual’s right to keep and bear arms and the licensing scheme set forth in the Firearms Act, R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 11-47-11(a) and 11-47-18, is reasonable legislative regulation of weapons that falls squarely within the State’s police power. Mosby v. Devine,

        Decision denying an application for a license to carry a concealed weapon was quashed where the chief of police incorrectly required a proper showing of need, a showing of need was not a component under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-11, and there was no evidence to show that the individual was untruthful as to the reasons for his application. Gadomski v. Tavares,

        In an applicant’s action seeking review of a police chief’s decision to deny his application for a permit or license to carry a concealed weapon, a remand was the appropriate remedy because a determination as to the applicant’s suitability required findings of fact best left to the licensing authority and not the Supreme Court; the documents the police chief submitted revealed a troubling history of events that called into question the applicant’s suitability to carry a concealed weapon.

     <p>
      Except as provided in § 11-47-15.3, all law enforcement officers of this state and its political subdivisions whose permanent appointment shall take place after June 17, 1959, will be required to qualify with the pistol or revolver with which they are armed prior to their permanent appointment, that qualification to be the same as that required in § 11-47-15. Town constables or police constables, special officers, and all law enforcement officers, who by law are authorized to carry side arms and whose appointments are made on a recurring basis, will be required to qualify not later than one year following the date of enactment of this section and their commissions or warrants will be plainly marked or stamped “QUALIFIED WITH PISTOL OR REVOLVER” and will be signed and dated by the certifying authority attesting to that fact. The failure of any law enforcement officer to qualify under the provisions of this section revokes his or her privilege of carrying a pistol or revolver, whether concealed or not, on or about his or her person. All law enforcement officers of this state and its political subdivisions will repeat this qualification at periods of not more than one year, except for correctional officers who must repeat this qualification every two (2) years.

        Trial court properly confirmed an arbitration award for a union in dispute over weapons training for correctional officers (COs) and refused to vacate the award where: (1) the director of the Rhode Island Department of Corrections’ (DOC) duty and authority under R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-56-10(14) to establish training programs for correctional officers (COs) was not exclusive; (2) the union was entitled to negotiate over matters that directly affected its members’ work and welfare; (3) § 42-56-10(14) did not prevent the DOC director from exercising his power in consultation with the union; (4) the dispute was arbitrable; and (5) the arbitrator’s reading of R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-17 as meaning that COs had to undergo weapons qualification at least every two years, and prescribing a maximum time period, rather than a minimum or fixed time period, within which COs had to complete weapons qualification was passably plausible.

       All law enforcement officers of this state and its political subdivisions, whose permanent appointment shall take place later than June 6, 1970, shall be required to qualify with the pistol or revolver with which they are armed prior to their permanent appointment, that qualification to be as required in §§ 11-47-15.1 and 11-47-15.3. All permanent appointed law enforcement officers of this state and its political subdivisions who are required to qualify under § 11-47-17 may, at the discretion of the officer, qualify under either § 11-47-15, 11-47-15.1 or 11-47-15.3. The failure of any law enforcement officer to qualify under the provisions of this section revokes his or her privilege of carrying a pistol or revolver, whether concealed or not, on or about his or her person. Qualification under this section will be required at periods of not more than one year, except for correctional officers who must repeat this qualification every two (2) years.

        R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-18 does not impose an express limitation on the Rhode Island Department of the Attorney General’s decision-making authority. Thus, § 11-47-18 does not implicitly require a hearing, and filing an application to carry a concealed weapon under that statute does not create a “contested case” under the Administrative Procedure Act, R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 42, ch. 35. Mosby v. Devine,

        Rhode Island Attorney General must adhere to minimum procedural requirements when rejecting an application filed under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-18; a rejected applicant is entitled to know the evidence upon which the Rhode Island Department of the Attorney General based its decision and the rationale for the denial. Armed with this information, an aggrieved applicant can petition the Supreme Court of Rhode Island for a writ of certiorari so that it may review the department’s decision for error of law, and, in conducting such a review, the court will not weigh the evidence nor substitute its judgment for that of the fact finder, but, rather, it will inspect the record to determine whether the department’s findings are supported by any legally competent evidence.

        Trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act, R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 42, ch. 35, to review the denial of an applicant’s request to carry a concealed weapon under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-18 by the Rhode Island Department of the Attorney General because: (1) the application did not have an impact on the right of the people to keep and bear arms under R.I. Const. art. I, § 2; and (2) R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-18 did not require a hearing on an individual’s application for a gun permit; thus, the decision was not a contested case. The only method to obtain judicial review of a denial of an application filed under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-47-18 is to seek a writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court of Rhode Island. Mosby v. Devine,

      <li id="t11c47s11-47-22ol1a">
       No property right shall exist in any firearm unlawfully possessed, carried, or used, and all unlawful firearms are hereby declared to be nuisances and forfeited to the state.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c47s11-47-22ol1b">
       When a firearm is lawfully seized, confiscated from or turned in by any person, it shall be placed in the custody of the superintendent of state police or the chief of police in the city or town in which it was seized, confiscated or turned in to. The officer who takes custody of the firearm shall promptly ascertain, using available record keeping systems, including, but not limited to, the National Crime Information Center, whether the firearm has been reported stolen and if stolen shall notify the reporting law enforcement agency of the recovery of said firearm. If the police department in the city or town in which the firearm was seized or confiscated has not been notified by a justice of the superior court or the attorney general that the firearm is necessary as evidence in a criminal or civil matter, it shall be returned to the lawful owner. However, any owner of a firearm who shall knowingly fail to report the loss or theft of the firearm to the proper law enforcement authorities shall not be entitled to its return.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c47s11-47-22ol1c">
       If a firearm is found not to be stolen and the owner cannot be readily ascertained within ninety (90) days subsequent to the seizure or confiscation of said firearm and the firearm is no longer necessary as evidence in a criminal or civil matter, the police department having custody of the firearm shall have the option of either: (1) destroying said firearm by rendering it permanently and irretrievably inoperable; (2) transferring custody of said firearms to the state crime laboratory for the purpose of criminal investigation; or (3) holding an auction of those firearms seized, confiscated or turned in to said police department; provided, however, any firearms to be transferred at auction shall be limited to antique firearms or curios or relics. For purposes of this section, “an antique firearm” shall be defined as any firearm (including any firearm with a matchlock, flintlock, percussion cap, or similar type of ignition system) manufactured on or before 1899, and any replica of such firearm if such replica is not designed or redesigned for using rim-fire or conventional center fire fixed ammunition, or uses rim-fire or conventional center fire fixed ammunition which is no longer manufactured in the United States and which is not readily available in the ordinary channels of commercial trade. “Curios or relics” shall be defined as firearms which are of special interest to collectors by reason of some quality other than is associated with firearms intended for sporting use or as offensive or defensive weapons. To be recognized as curios or relics, firearms must be manufactured at least fifty (50) years prior to the current date, but not including replicas thereof, and firearms which derive a substantial part of their monetary value from the fact that they are novel, rare, bizarre, or because of their association with some historical figure, period, or event.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c47s11-47-22ol1d">
       In the event that an auction is held, bidders shall be limited to bona fide holders of a valid Federal Firearms License for Retail Sale or a Federal Firearms Collector License. Any auction shall be advertised at least once a week for a period of three (3) weeks preceding the date of the auction in a newspaper of general circulation, said notice clearly stating the time, location and terms of said auction. All funds realized shall be used to purchase and provide necessary safety equipment, including, but not limited to, bulletproof vests, for the police department holding the auction and shall not revert to any general fund of the state, city or town, as the case may be.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c47s11-47-22ol1e">
       All firearms received by any police department in any manner shall be entered in the department’s permanent records and listed by make, model, caliber and serial number and the manner in which said firearm was disposed of and, if by auction, the name and federal license number of the buyer. A copy of said record shall be forwarded to the office of the Rhode Island Attorney General and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms of the United States Treasury Department on at least an annual basis.

        Although this section creates an implication that the possession of a handgun in violation of § 11-47-8 constitutes evidence that such possession was unlawful, such a statutory inference does not relieve the state of its constitutional burden to prove that the defendant’s possession of the weapon was unlawful. This section does nothing more than shift the evidentiary burden of production to the defendant, and once the defendant has raised the issue of justification and has satisfied the burden of production, the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant’s possession was unlawful shifts back to the state.

      Every officer authorized to make an arrest may, without complaint and warrant, arrest any person who has in his or her possession any firearm whenever the officer has reasonable ground to suspect that the person possesses or is using or is carrying the firearm contrary to law. Any person so arrested may be detained a reasonable time, not exceeding twenty-four (24) hours, for the purpose of making an investigation concerning the person, but no person so arrested shall be detained longer than twenty-four (24) hours without complaint being made against him or her before some proper court or justice. If the officer making the arrest shall at any time within the twenty-four (24) hours satisfy himself or herself that there is no ground for making a criminal complaint against the person, he or she shall be discharged from custody.

      Every officer authorized to make an arrest for any criminal offense may arrest without complaint and warrant any person who has in his or her possession any instrument or weapon described in § 11-47-42 whenever the officer has reasonable ground to suspect that the person possesses, or is using, wearing or carrying the instrument or weapon contrary to law. Any person so arrested may be detained a reasonable time, not exceeding twenty-four (24) hours, for the purpose of making an investigation concerning the person, but no person so arrested shall be detained longer than twenty-four (24) hours without complaint being made against him or her before some proper court or justice. If the officer making the arrest shall at any time within the twenty-four (24) hours satisfy himself or herself that there is no ground for making a criminal complaint against the person, he or she shall be discharged from custody.

       No person shall use any live human fetus, whether before or after expulsion from its mother’s womb, for scientific, laboratory research, or other kind of experimentation. This section shall not prohibit procedures incident to the study of a human fetus while it is in its mother’s womb, provided that in the best medical judgment of the physician, made at the time of the study, the procedures do not substantially jeopardize the life or health of the fetus, and provided the fetus is not the subject of a planned abortion. In any criminal proceeding the fetus shall be conclusively presumed not to be the subject of a planned abortion if the mother signed a written statement at the time of the study that she was not planning an abortion.

       A fetus is a live fetus for purposes of this section when, in the best medical judgment of a physician, it shows evidence of life as determined by the same medical standards as are used in determining evidence of life in a spontaneously aborted fetus at approximately the same stage of gestational development.

       No experimentation may knowingly be performed upon a dead fetus unless the consent of its mother has first been obtained, provided, that such consent shall not be required in the case of a routine pathological study. In any criminal proceeding, consent shall be conclusively presumed to have been granted for the purposes of this section by a written statement, signed by the mother, who is at least eighteen (18) years of age, to the effect that she consents to the use of her fetus for scientific, laboratory, research, or other kind of experimentation or study; that written consent shall constitute lawful authorization for the transfer of the dead fetus.

        Since the language defining harassment is phrased in the alternative, the fact that a victim may not have been in fear of bodily injury is irrelevant if the defendant’s conduct would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress. State v. Breen,

        An envelope, which was sent by defendant to his ex-wife, and its contents, which were materials related to the prevention of domestic violence, were properly admitted in defendant’s trial for violation of a no-contact order and stalking because although the contents of the envelope did not make it any more or less probable that defendant intentionally contacted his ex-wife in violation of the no-contact order, they were relevant to the charges of stalking under R.I. Gen. Law § 11-59-1(2) to show that defendant intended to “seriously alarm, annoy, or bother” her, in contravention of R.I. Gen. Law § 11-59-2.

        Defendant’s conviction of misdemeanor stalking, R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-59-2 was affirmed; under the version of the law in effect at the time the crime was committed, the trial court properly denied defendant’s motion to dismiss the action, as the State presented conclusive evidence that defendant was aware that his advances toward the victim were unwelcome, which satisfied the definition of harassment under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-59-1. State v. Stierhoff,

        The language of this section prior to the 1995 amendment gave adequate warning to potential offenders of the conduct that was prohibited; it defies logic to conclude that a defendant would have to commit more than one series of harassing acts in order to be found guilty of stalking. Thus, this section as originally enacted passed constitutional muster and was not so ambiguously worded as to have been unconstitutionally vague. State v. Fonseca,
        <cite class="ocri">
         670 A.2d 1237
        </cite>
        ,

       <p>
        Defendant’s conviction of misdemeanor stalking, R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-59-2 was affirmed; the version of the statute in effect at the time the crime was committed was unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. XIV, as the evidence established that defendant’s unsolicited contact with the victim was unwelcome. State v. Stierhoff,
        <cite class="ocri">
         879 A.2d 425

        Once an earlier episode of stalking had been recounted to the jury for the purpose of reflecting on the victim’s state of mind, the timing and circumstances of four new communications, unthreatening though they may have been in isolation, became clear, and the evidence was sufficient for a finding of harassment beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Breen,
        <cite class="ocri">

        Defendant’s conviction of misdemeanor stalking, R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-59-2 was affirmed; under the version of the law in effect at the time the crime was committed, the trial court properly denied defendant’s motion to dismiss the action, as the State presented conclusive evidence that defendant was aware that his advances toward the victim were unwelcome, which satisfied the definition of harassment under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-59-1. State v. Stierhoff,
        <cite class="ocri">

       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not entitled to dismissal of stalking charges because defendant was not entitled to prior notice that defendant’s acts were disturbing or unwanted, as this section barred willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly following another to put that person in reasonable fear of bodily injury, and required no direct victim contact. State v. Kolsoi,
        <cite class="ocri">
         126 A.3d 487

       </p>
       <p>
        Three of five victims’ testimony was not required to show the victims’ reasonable fear of bodily injury because (1) the victims traveled together and the State said their testimony would have been the same as those who testified, so the testimony would have been cumulative, (2) this section required only proof of defendant’s intent to put another in reasonable fear of bodily injury, and (3) testifying victims and surveillance footage sufficiently showed defendant directed defendant’s acts toward all five victims.

        The absence of a precise statutory definition of “legitimate purpose” was not fatal to the state’s case against a defendant accused of stalking in light of the substantial evidence that the defendant was amply aware that his continued communications were unwelcome. State v. Breen,

        In a prosecution for video voyeurism, as a reasonable inference could be drawn from the facts alleged in a detective’s affidavit that defendant would take home the easily transportable digital camera he used to take photos beneath a child’s skirt, a warrant to search defendant’s home for cameras was supported by probable cause under U.S. Const. amend. IV and R.I. Const. art. I, § 6. Therefore, photographic images of the child found on a camera seized pursuant to the warrant were admissible. State v. Byrne,

Immediately upon stopping the person, the theater owner, an employee or agent of a theater owner shall identify himself or herself and state his or her reason for stopping the person. If after his or her initial confrontation with the person under suspicion, the theater owner or lessee, or employee or agent of a theater owner or lessee, has reasonable grounds to believe that at the time stopped, the person was committing or attempting to commit the crime of unlawful operation of a recording device on the premises, the theater owner or lessee, or employee or agent of a theater owner or lessee, may detain the person for a reasonable time sufficient to summon a police officer to the premises. In no case shall the detention be for a period exceeding one hour. Detention must be accomplished in a reasonable manner without unreasonable restraint or excessive force, and may take place only on the premises of the “motion picture theater” establishment where the alleged crime occurred. Any person so stopped by a theater owner or lessee, or employee or agent of an owner or lessee pursuant to this section shall promptly identify himself or herself by name and address. Once placed under detention, no other information shall be required of the person and no written and/or signed statement shall be elicited from the person until a police officer has taken him or her into custody.
