       <p>
        The issue of whether § 30-3-13 provided “officers of the staff corps and departments” with a property right, of which they could not be deprived without due process, to retain their Army National Guard commissions until the age of sixty, turns on the meaning of the phrase “staff corps and departments”, and that interpretation is better left to the Rhode Island state courts. Wigginton v. Centracchio,
        <cite class="ocri">
         205 F.3d 504

       </p>
       <p>
        Rhode Island’s national guard organization was required to mirror that of the United States Army, the term “staff corps and departments” was a vestigial one, carried over into current statutes from the past organization of the United States Army, and it has no modern meaning and no meaning in the context of a retired officer’s wrongful dismissal action. Wigginton v. Centracchio,
        <cite class="ocri">
         787 A.2d 1151

       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme Court of Rhode Island has found that the term “staff corps and departments” is a vestigial term that cannot fairly be construed to have any meaning in modern military organization or application to presently commissioned officers. Wigginton v. Centracchio,

Such assistance shall be available for courses creditable to associate, bachelor’s, or master’s degrees. Failure to satisfactorily fulfill the service obligation incurred in return for tuition assistance will require the participant to repay a pro-rata share of said assistance. This obligation shall be considered to be a debt owed to the state and may be satisfied by offset against any state transfer payments or state income tax refunds. The participating member shall reimburse the Rhode Island national guard when any of the following occur: the soldier fails to participate satisfactorily as a member of the Rhode Island national guard; the soldier withdraws from, or fails to complete, a course for personal reasons; the soldier fails to make up an incomplete grade within time limits stipulated by the institution or one hundred twenty (120) days after the completion of the class, whichever occurs first; or the soldier fails to provide the adjutant general a copy of the grade report within thirty (30) days of course completion and may be subject to punishment under the Rhode Island military code.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The position of director is a job position in the unclassified service and the director serves at the pleasure of the governor. Therefore, the job of director falls within an exception of the First Amendment general prohibition of termination for political affiliation. Cotugno v. Sundlun,

       </p>
       <p>
        Party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the effective performance of the directorship; a former director’s First Amendment rights were not violated when he was discharged after a new governor took office. Cotugno v. Sundlun,

       A state of emergency shall be declared by executive order or proclamation of the governor if he or she finds a disaster has occurred or that this occurrence, or the threat thereof, is imminent. The state of disaster emergency shall continue until the governor finds that the threat or danger has passed or the disaster has been dealt with to the extent that emergency conditions no longer exist and terminates the state of disaster emergency by executive order or proclamation, but no state of disaster emergency may continue for longer than thirty (30) days unless renewed by the governor. The general assembly, by concurrent resolution, may terminate a state of disaster emergency at any time. Thereupon, the governor shall issue an executive order or proclamation ending the state of disaster emergency and what actions are being taken to control the emergency and what action the public should take to protect themselves. All executive orders or proclamations issued under this subsection shall indicate the nature of the disaster, the area or areas threatened, and the conditions that have brought it about or that make possible termination of the state of disaster emergency. An executive order or proclamation shall be disseminated promptly by means calculated to bring its contents to the attention of the general public and, unless the circumstances attendant upon the disaster prevent or impede, promptly filed with the agency, the secretary of state, and the city and town clerks in the area to which it applies.

       During the continuance of any state of disaster emergency the governor is commander-in-chief of the organized and unorganized militia and of all other forces available for emergency duty. To the greatest extent practicable, the governor shall delegate or assign command authority by prior arrangement embodied in appropriate executive orders or regulations, but nothing herein restricts the governor’s authority to do so by orders issued at the time of the disaster emergency.

         Suspend the provisions of any regulatory statute prescribing the procedures for conduct of state business, or the orders, rules, or regulations of any state agency, if strict compliance with the provisions of any statute, order, rule, or regulation would in any way prevent, hinder, or delay necessary action in coping with the emergency, provided that the suspension of any statute, order, rule or regulation will be limited in duration and scope to the emergency action requiring said suspension;

When assigned, detailed, or made available as aforesaid, the city or town in which the police or firefighters shall perform outside duties shall provide them with subsistence or pay them a reasonable allowance therefor, and shall also be liable for any damage to the apparatus or equipment incurred while being so used; provided, however, that a city or town shall be reimbursed by the state out of the general fund of the state for all expenses incurred under the foregoing provisions of this subsection;

It is the duty of state health authorities and the local code enforcement officials to make and enforce rules and regulations designed to prevent the introduction of any contagious or infectious disease and to safeguard the public health within the area.

       There is hereby created an emergency claims commission, consisting of three (3) qualified electors of this state, who shall, if deemed necessary, within ten (10) days after the governor proclaims an emergency, be appointed by the presiding justice of the superior court. Any vacancy in the membership of the commission shall be filled immediately by the presiding justice. The presiding justice shall fix the per diem compensation of the members of the commission. The commission shall determine what sum will justly compensate the claimant for the property taken, and that determination shall be made in accordance with the procedure established by the majority of the justices of the superior court, which procedure shall be designed to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of claims for compensation. The commission may hire, and the state shall pay for, the services of any skilled and disinterested appraisers that the commission shall deem necessary to assist it in the performance of its duties. The clerk of the superior court for Providence county shall detail one of the assistant clerks and any clerical assistance that may be necessary to assist the commission in performing its duties, and when and if the commission so requests, the clerks of the superior courts for the other counties of the state shall furnish the commission any clerical assistance that it may require. The proper authorities shall provide the commission with suitable and convenient quarters in the courthouses of the state.

       Whenever the governor takes possession of, or title to, any real or personal property pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, he or she shall immediately cause the owner and/or possessor of the property, referred to as the “claimant”, to be notified in any manner that the commission provides, and shall also cause a copy of the notice to be filed with the commission. If the claimant or the attorney general representing the state is not satisfied with the award made by the commission, he or she may appeal within thirty (30) days after the award to the superior court and the proceedings shall thereafter be conducted in the superior court in accordance with the guaranties of the constitution and any rules of procedure that a majority of the justices of the court may adopt. Review by the supreme court shall be available to the state and to the claimant in accordance with any rules that a majority of the justices of the supreme court may adopt provided a petition for review is filed in the office of the clerk of the supreme court within thirty (30) days after entry of the decision of the superior court. These proceedings shall have precedence on the calendars of the courts. All unappealed awards and final judgments entered against the state in all proceedings and the fees and expenses of the commission shall be paid by the general treasurer out of any money in the treasury appropriated for this purpose and/or any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated, and this direction shall constitute an appropriation for the payment of the awards, judgments, fees, and expenses.

       This compact also provides for the process of planning mechanisms among the agencies responsible and for mutual cooperation, including, if need be, emergency-related exercises, testing, or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party jurisdictions or subdivisions of party jurisdictions during emergencies, with such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of emergency forces by mutual agreement among party jurisdictions.

      </h3>
      <p>
       General Implementation —  Each party jurisdiction entering into this compact recognizes that many emergencies may exceed the capabilities of a party jurisdiction and that intergovernmental cooperation is essential in such circumstances. Each jurisdiction further recognizes that there will be emergencies that may require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency because few, if any, individual jurisdictions have all the resources they need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       The prompt, full and effective utilization of resources of the participating jurisdictions, including any resources on hand or available from any other source that are essential to the safety, care and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster, shall be the underlying principle on which all articles of this compact are understood.
      </p>
      <p>
       On behalf of the party jurisdictions participating in the compact, the legally designated official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management is responsible for formulation of the appropriate inter-jurisdictional mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact, and for recommendations to the jurisdiction concerned with respect to the amendment of any statutes, regulations or ordinances required for that purpose.

       Limitation —  Any party jurisdiction requested to render mutual aid or conduct exercises and training for mutual aid shall undertake to respond as soon as possible, except that it is understood that the jurisdiction rendering aid may withhold or recall resources to the extent necessary to provide reasonable protection for that jurisdiction. Each party jurisdiction shall afford to the personnel of the emergency forces of any party jurisdiction, while operating within its jurisdictional limits under the terms and conditions of this compact and under the operational control of an officer of the requesting party, the same powers, duties, rights, privileges and immunities as are afforded similar or like forces of the jurisdiction in which they are performing emergency services. Emergency forces continue under the command and control of their regular leaders, but the organizational units come under the operational control of the emergency services authorities of the jurisdiction receiving assistance. These conditions may be activated, as needed, by the jurisdiction that is to receive assistance or upon commencement of exercises or training for mutual aid and continue as long as the exercises or training for mutual aid are in progress, the emergency or disaster remains in effect or loaned resources remain in the receiving jurisdiction or jurisdictions, whichever is longer. The receiving jurisdiction is responsible for informing the assisting jurisdictions of the specific moment when services will no longer be required.

     <p>
      This compact is made and entered into by and between the participating member states which enact this compact, hereinafter called party states. For the purposes of this agreement, the term “states” is taken to mean the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and all United States territorial possessions.
     </p>
     <p>
      The purpose of this compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the states entering into this compact in managing any emergency or disaster that is duly declared by the governor of the affected state(s), whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, civil emergency aspects of resources shortages, community disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack.
     </p>
     <p>
      This compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency-related exercises, testing or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of party states during emergencies, such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods. Mutual assistance in this company may include the use of the states’ National Guard forces, either in accordance with the National Guard Mutual Assistance Company or by mutual agreement between states.

     <p>
      Each party state entering into this compact recognizes many emergencies transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact. Each state further recognizes that there will be emergencies which require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency. This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources they may need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist.
     </p>
     <p>
      The prompt, full, and effective utilization of resources of the participating states, including any resources on hand or available from the Federal Government or any other source, that are essential to the safety, care and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster declared by a party state, shall be the underlying principle on which all provisions of this compact shall be understood.
     </p>
     <p>
      On behalf of the governor of each state participating in the compact, the legally designated state official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management will be responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact.

Emergency forces will continue under the command and control of their regular leaders, but the organizational units will come under the operational control of the emergency services authorities of the state receiving assistance. These conditions may be activated, as needed, only subsequent to a declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor of the party state that is to receive assistance or commencement of exercises or training for mutual aid and shall continue so long as the exercises or training for mutual aid are in progress, the state of emergency or disaster remains in effect or loaned resources remain in the receiving state(s) whichever is longer.

       Purpose of chapter.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      By order of the President of the United States on February 24, 1944, there was established in the Office of War Mobilization a retraining and reemployment administration to have general supervision and direction of activities relating to the retraining and reemployment of persons discharged or released from the armed services and to develop programs for that purpose and for the adequate care of those veterans, including physical and occupational therapy for the wounded and disabled and the resumption of education interrupted by the war. By its order issued May 17, 1944, the retraining and reemployment administration outlined a plan for the establishment and maintenance of veterans’ information service centers in local communities by which it sought to provide a way to merge the interest of all organizations, federal, state, local, and civic, in the rehabilitation and assistance of veterans. To aid in the carrying out of this plan, the retraining and reemployment administration established in each state a veterans’ service committee consisting of a representative of the Selective Service System, the War Manpower Commission, and the Veterans Administration with power to enlarge its membership to include representation from local organizations or to represent the federal government on state committees of the same nature. The purpose of this chapter is to authorize the establishment of local veterans’ retraining and reemployment committees and the establishment and maintenance of veterans’ information service centers by the several cities and towns in this state to the end that all veterans may be furnished in their own communities with full information with respect to their various rights and privileges under federal and state laws and with adequate advice and assistance in securing the benefits thereof and in solving the problems of readjusting their lives from war to peacetime activities.

     <p>
      The director of the department of human services is hereby authorized and empowered to establish and maintain a domiciliary care program for homeless veterans (veterans transitional supportive program, V.T.S.P.) at the Rhode Island veterans’ home. Any veteran admitted to the Rhode Island veterans’ home pursuant to this section shall be exempt from the maintenance fee assessment established pursuant to § 30-24-10; provided, however, that the director shall assess against each veteran admitted under this program a monthly maintenance fee equal to ten percent (10%) of the veteran’s monthly gross income, from whatever source derived and whether taxable or non-taxable. In addition there will also be additional beds called extended, V.T.S.P. beds to which a monthly maintenance fee of thirty percent (30%) will be charged. Extended V.T.S.P. will be available to eligible veterans in the V.T.S.P. program, but occupancy will not exceed four (4) months. The maintenance fee shall be paid monthly to the veterans’ home and shall be deposited in the veterans’ home fund. Any failure to make payment when due shall be cause for dismissal from the facility. Prior to any dismissal for non-payment of fees, the veteran shall be afforded administrative due process. The director is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations to effectuate the intent and provisions of this section, and this grant of authority to promulgate rules and regulations shall be liberally construed.

      The general assembly shall annually appropriate such a sum as may be necessary, out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated, for the purpose of creating and maintaining a “dependents’ education fund” from which shall be paid in whole or in part the charges for the tuition and books of such of the sons, daughters, and surviving spouses of veterans who died as the result of hostile action or a service-connected disability arising out of active service in the armed forces, or who died from any cause while such a disability was in existence, or of those who are serving in the far east and had a legal residence in this state at the time they were commissioned, warranted, enlisted, or inducted into the military or naval service of the United States and were either missing in action or are prisoners of war, provided that the next of kin has not been advised by the armed forces that the serviceperson has been released or is no longer classified as missing in action. The benefits shall be extended to dependents who are attending, or may attend, the university of Rhode Island, Rhode Island college, or any institution of higher education or technical/professional learning. The maximum aid granted shall not exceed the in-state tuition cost plus average cost of books of attending the university of Rhode Island in that year, the costs to be yearly certified by the Board of Education to the administering agency; provided, any child dependent shall enter the institution while between the ages of sixteen (16) and twenty-six (26); and provided, further, that the aid herein granted shall be available to that child for such period of time as shall equal the normal time for completing the courses regularly offered by the institution, but in no case more than four (4) years; and provided, further, that this chapter shall apply also to the children of those who are serving in the far east, but did not have legal residence in this state at the time those persons were commissioned, warranted, enlisted, or inducted into the military or naval service of the United States; provided that those children have resided in this state continuously for five (5) years and are otherwise eligible, upon the presentation to the proper administering authority of sufficient evidence that the parent qualifies the child to receive the benefits under this section; and provided, further, that, as to surviving spouses, the benefits must be utilized within a period of ten (10) years from the date eligibility is found or from the date of death of the spouse from whom eligibility is derived.
