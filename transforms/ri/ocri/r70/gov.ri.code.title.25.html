        The Rhode Island Supreme Court has not had occasion to render any explication of the interplay between RCP, Rule 6 and this section. Historically, however, the Rhode Island courts have, in rendering such analyses, looked to federal court interpretations of rules of civil procedure in cases where the state procedures are modeled upon, or are analogous or similar to, the federal rules, such as Fed.

      The fourth day of May in each and every year is established, in this state, as a day for celebration of Rhode Island independence, being a just tribute to the memory of the members of our general assembly, who, on the fourth day of May, 1776, in the State House at Providence, passed an act renouncing allegiance of the colony to the British crown and by the provisions of that act declared Rhode Island sovereign and independent, the first official act of its kind by any of the thirteen (13) American colonies.
