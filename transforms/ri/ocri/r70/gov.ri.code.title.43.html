      Whenever the governor returns to either house any measure, which he or she does not approve, he or she shall, if the house is in session, transmit the measure to the presiding officer. But if the house to which the measure is required by law to be returned has adjourned for the day, but not for the session, at the time the governor desires to make the return, then he or she shall deliver the measure, in the case of the senate, to the secretary or clerk, and, in the case of the house of representatives, to the reading or recording clerk. Delivery of the measure to any one of the officers shall constitute a delivery to the house of which he or she is an officer. Any officer receiving any measure shall certify thereon the day and hour of its receipt and shall, at the opening of the next daily session of the house of which he or she is an officer, deliver the measure to the presiding officer.

      When an act of a general and permanent nature passed by the general assembly becomes a law and is filed with the secretary of state, the law revision director of the joint committee on legislative services shall examine the act and, if as enacted it has not been assigned to sections of the general laws or if section numbers of the general laws have been improperly assigned, the law revision director of the joint committee on legislative services shall assign each section of the act, which is proper for incorporation in the general laws, an official section number of the general laws. Where necessary, sections may be combined or divided in the assignment of the numbers. The assigned official section numbers shall be entered upon the original bill, as enacted. Sections of the general laws shall be cited and referred to by the assigned official numbers and may be amended by reference thereto. The official section numbers of the general laws as assigned by the law revision director of the joint committee on legislative services shall be used in the publication of the public laws, and internal section references in any act shall be changed to correspond to the assigned official numbers.

        The act of 4 George II, ch. 26, prohibiting the use of Latin in pleadings is not among the English statutes referred to in this section. Nevertheless, the use of Latin terms is impermissible unless they have become so anglicized as to have been adopted as a part of the English language and are so clearly intelligible as not to require resort to a law dictionary by one whose education did not include a study of the ancient language. Their use so clouds a pleading with vagueness and indefiniteness as not sufficiently to inform the adverse party of what he may be called upon to meet. Williamson v. General Fin. Corp.,

        In the event that a real or seeming ambiguity is perceived in reading the language of a statute, the Supreme Court will attempt to ascertain the intention of a legislative body from a consideration of the entire statute, keeping in mind its nature, object, language and arrangement, and this doctrine is applicable to the ascertainment of the intent of the framers of a municipal charter.

        The savings statute, § 43-3-23, which would have operated to impose a harsher sentence under prior law, was held inapplicable since there was a manifest legislative intent to mitigate the penalty. State v. Macarelli,

        Legislature intended the minimum-damages provision of the Wrongful Death Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-7-2, to apply on a per-claim—rather than per-defendant—basis; because application of the rule that words importing the singular number may be extended or applied to several persons or things would not lead to a construction inconsistent with the manifest intent of the General Assembly, or be repugnant to some other part of the statute, the minimum-damages provision of § 10-7-2 applies to multiple actors.

        Acts which constituted rape under former § 11-37-1 could be prosecuted even though the prosecution was commenced after the repeal of that section due to the simultaneous-repeal-and-reenactment exception to the abatement doctrine. State v. Babbitt,

        Where, in a prosecution for indecent assault pursuant to former § 11-37-6, the information was not filed until June 24, 1980, there was no prosecution pending when the legislature repealed the indecent-assault section on May 9, 1979. Therefore, the general savings clause of this section did not apply, and defendant’s conviction for indecent assault was reversed. State v. Souza,

        The common-law rule of abatement holds that in the absence of a savings provision a defendant may not be convicted under a statute that has been repealed. State v. Souza,

       <p>
        Criminal actions that have not yet commenced when the statute outlining the crime charged is repealed abated pursuant to the common-law rule and are not saved by this section. State v. Souza,

       <p>
        The simultaneous-repeal-and-reenactment exception to the abatement doctrine holds that a new act should be considered a continuation of the old in situations in which no substantial changes have been made in the legislation. Under such circumstances, there is no abatement of any of the legal consequences of acts committed under the old statute. State v. Babbitt,
        <cite class="ocri">

        Supreme Court of Rhode Island held that the trial justice was correct in determining that the general savings clause, R.I. Gen. Laws § 43-3-23, was applicable and that the 2012 amendment to R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-41-5 should not have been applied retroactively. State v. Whiting,

       <p>
        Defendant’s conviction under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-41-5 was affirmed where the 2012 amendment to the statute concerned a mere increase in the monetary threshold, the amendment was not a qualitative shift altering the fundamental essence of larceny prosecutions, and defendant’s conduct had remained illegal at all times.

        Where criminal statute is repealed and repealing statute contains no saving clause, this section has the effect of saving criminal proceedings pending at the time of the repeal unless such construction would be clearly repugnant to the express provisions of the repealing statute. State v. Lewis,
        <cite class="ocri">

        The trial justice did not err in determining that the preservation of abominable and detestable crime against nature charges against the defendant would have been inconsistent with the manifest intention of the legislature to decriminalize sodomy between consenting adults and that such preservation would be repugnant to the statute as amended.

        Director of the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation, acting as an insurance rehabilitator, acted within the broad grant of statutory authority under R.I. Gen. Laws § 27-14.3-18(d) in crafting a sale plan for an insurer and its subsidiary in order for the insurer to become a stock company for purposes of revitalization and avoidance of possible insolvency. The plan included deferral of payments to two state Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plans; as there was no conflict with R.I. Gen. Laws § 27-33-6, which did not prohibit such payment deferral, statutory principles under R.I. Gen. Laws § 43-3-26 were not applicable, and the sale plan was properly approved by the trial court.

        There is an apparent conflict between the Responsibility of Owners of Rental Vehicles Act (chapter 34 of title 31) and the Motor Vehicle Reparations Act (chapter 47 of title 31), as the former does not require an out-of-state rental vehicle agency to give proof of financial responsibility for vehicles not registered in this state, whereas the latter statute does appear to require such a showing. The former statute, being the more specific, prevails, pursuant to this section (conflicting general and special provisions). Lopes v. Phillips,

        Protecting the “full status” under § 36-5-7 of the plaintiff, a sheriff denied reappointment by the governor, conflicted with the express language of § 42-29-1, which limits the sheriff ’s term of office to ten years. Since under this section, a special statute prevails over a conflicting general provision, the governor’s right to appoint his own sheriff under § 42-29-1 prevailed over the plaintiff ’s interest in continued employment under § 36-5-7.
