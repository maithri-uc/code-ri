       Preserve, enhance, and allow for any necessary regeneration of the fisheries of the state, for the benefit of the people of the state, as an ecological asset and as a source of food and recreation;

      <li id="t20c2.1s20-2.1-2ol13">
       Allow residents who have fished commercially to sell their vessels and gear in a manner that first, facilitates up-grading license levels among residents already in the fishery; that second, provides lateral movement among residents who are holders of commercial fishing licenses to other types of fishing; and that third, enables new entrants into new commercial fishing;
      </li>
      <li id="t20c2.1s20-2.1-2ol14">
       Respect the interests of residents who fish under licenses issued by the state and wish to continue to fish commercially in a manner that is economically viable; provided, it is specifically not a purpose of this chapter to establish licensing procedures that eliminate the ability to fish commercially of any resident as of the date of enactment who validly holds commercial fishing license and who meets the application renewal requirements set forth herein;

        Lobstermen’s challenge brought in state court challenging lobster-trap allocation regulations as a violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 20-2.1-9 required them to show (i) that the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management director mandated retroactive control dates, notwithstanding (ii) that retroactive control dates were not compulsory under federal law. Thus, it was not logically possible for them to prevail without affirmatively answering the embedded question of whether federal law, in the form of a fishery management plan promulgated under the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Compact, expressly required the use of retroactive control dates and therefore, the federal court had jurisdiction under

        Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management was entitled to summary judgment on the fishermen’s argument that R.I. Marine Fisheries Regulation 6.7-8(a) violated R.I. Gen. Laws § 20-2.1-9 because Rhode Island law did not grant the Director of DEM the power to create and/or transfer rights of access to the public marine resource; it was undisputed that no final regulation had been promulgated by DEM providing for the transferability of lobster trap allocations, and thus, the fishermen’s argument on that point was clearly premature.

        Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management was entitled to summary judgment on the fishermen’s argument that the department acted contrary to R.I. Gen. Laws § 20-2.1-9(4)(ii) by adopting a regulatory scheme that used retroactive control dates to determine the allocation of lobster traps; since Rhode Island did not submit an alternative plan and the fishermen had not presented any evidence identifying a particular alternative plan, the fishermen failed to show that the hypothetical plan would have met the same fishing mortality target of Amendment 3 to the Interstate Fishery Management Plan for American Lobster as required as a result of Rhode Island’s membership in the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Compact.

      </li>
      <li id="t20c2.2s20-2.2-1ol13">
       The federal government and regional entities have established and continue to establish regulatory programs, management measures, quotas, and other restrictions that affect persons engaged in marine recreational fisheries in Rhode Island, and Rhode Island functions in whole or in part in the context of federal and regional programs, depending on the fishery;
      </li>
      <li id="t20c2.2s20-2.2-1ol14">
       The regulatory programs, management measures, quotas, and other restrictions governing marine recreational fisheries are based primarily on catch and effort statistics from recreational fisherman, and on fishery resource assessments, that gauge the biological status of fish stocks;
      </li>
      <li id="t20c2.2s20-2.2-1ol15">
       Since 1979, recreational fishing assessments have been derived from the Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey (MRFSS), administered by the federal government in partnership with the states;
      </li>
      <li id="t20c2.2s20-2.2-1ol16">
       In 2006, Congress acknowledged major flaws in the accuracy of the assessments provided by MRFSS and called upon the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to undertake programmatic reforms, including the establishment of a universal registry of all saltwater anglers to provide a more accurate and efficient means for acquiring recreational catch and effort data;
      </li>
      <li id="t20c2.2s20-2.2-1ol17">
       In 2008, NMFS initiated a new Marine Recreational Information Program (MRIP) to replace MRFSS and enacted rules requiring marine recreational fisherman to either register under a new national program, or be registered or licensed by a state program that meets federal requirements;
      </li>

      <li id="t20c2.2s20-2.2-1ol19">
       The interests of recreational saltwater anglers in Rhode Island can best be met by establishing a state program that meets federal requirements, contributes to improved state-based recreational fishing assessments and stock assessments, and supports fair and effective regulatory programs and quota allocations for Rhode Island’s marine recreational fisheries;
      </li>
      <li id="t20c2.2s20-2.2-1ol110">

     <p>
      The department, with the advice and involvement of the council, the University of Rhode Island Coastal Institute, and commercial and recreational fishing interests, shall undertake the following studies and analyses that shall evaluate the full reasonable range of options for improving fisheries management in Rhode Island. The process for undertaking these studies and analyses and developing legislative options for consideration by the general assembly shall be open, inclusive, and participatory and shall fairly and appropriately involve the range of fishing interests and give fair and balanced consideration to the interests of year-round, seasonal, and recreational fishers, full and part-time fishers, aquaculturists, and persons who may wish to participate in fishing in the future:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t20c3.1s20-3.1-7ol11">
       Principles for fisheries management.  The department shall, by October 1, 2001, recommend goals and principles to guide the development and implementation of a restructured marine fisheries management system.
      </li>
      <li id="t20c3.1s20-3.1-7ol12">
       Commercial fisheries.  The department shall, by January 1, 2002, recommend options for commercial fishing licenses that address license eligibility; provide for new entrants into fisheries in the state; and establish an analytic basis for and a method to manage fisheries by effort, as well as by quota for catch by species.
      </li>
      <li id="t20c3.1s20-3.1-7ol13">
       Recreational fisheries.  The department is authorized to propose a licensing system for recreational fisheries for the purposes of: (i) Obtaining reliable data about the level and effects of recreational fishing in the state; (ii) Improving the quality and extent of recreational fishing opportunities in Rhode Island; and (iii) Providing revenue to be used solely and exclusively for the purposes of managing recreational fisheries and enhancing recreational fishing opportunities. The licensing system shall not be effective either before April 1, 2003, or without general assembly approval, and shall be put into effect by rule, after a finding by the director, following the general assembly approval, that the system is fair, enforceable, and accomplishes the purposes of this chapter.
      </li>
      <li id="t20c3.1s20-3.1-7ol14">
       Commercial aquaculture.  The department shall, by January 1, 2002, develop proposed rules and recommend statutory changes for the purposes of fostering the expansion and competitiveness of commercial aquaculture, which rules shall treat commercial aquaculture as a separate and distinct activity from commercial fishing.
      </li>
      <li id="t20c3.1s20-3.1-7ol15">
       Comprehensive.  The department shall develop a plan, by January 1, 2002, to coordinate Rhode Island licensing requirements with federal licensing requirements and licensing requirements in other states that minimizes conflicts and confusion in licensing and reporting; provides for consistent data collection and analysis; and supports regional management efforts that maintain or enhance the stewardship and productivity of fisheries resources.

      No person shall engage in the taking for sale, by any manner, method, or contrivance, of any marine finfish, shellfish, crustacean, or other invertebrate; and no vessel, boat, trap, seine, or other fishing gear shall be used in the taking for sale or landing of any marine finfish, shellfish, crustacean, or other invertebrate unless a license or permit has been obtained as provided in this title. Provided, however, that for all commercial fisheries except shellfish, any number of unlicensed crews may assist in direct commercial harvest operations regardless of the manner, method, or contrivance employed, as long as said crew is/are located onboard a commercially declared vessel that is operated by an individual who possesses a valid and proper commercial fishing license and is/are under the direct supervision and responsibility of said properly licensed commercial fisher. With respect to commercial shellfish operations, unlicensed crews may only assist with culling activities and other indirect harvest operations, as the director may determine by regulations adopted pursuant to this title, while said crew is/are located onboard a commercially declared vessel that is operated by an individual who possesses a valid and proper commercial fishing license and is/are under the direct supervision and responsibility of said properly licensed commercial fisher.

      Except as hereinafter provided and unless otherwise specified by regulation of the marine fisheries council, no person shall take any oysters, bay quahaugs, or soft-shell clams from the waters of this state by dredges, rakes, or other apparatus operated by mechanical power or hauled by power boats. No licensed person shall cast, haul, or have overboard any dredges while fishing for oysters, bay quahaugs, or soft-shell clams from the free and common fisheries of this state, nor shall any licensed boat be used for fishing oysters, soft-shell clams, or bay quahaugs with dredges, except as provided in this section; provided, that any person having a license issued under this title for the taking of scallops may use a dredge or dredges, not exceeding six (6) in number nor exceeding twenty-eight inches (28") each in width, for that purpose; provided further, that the licensee shall immediately return all oysters, soft-shell clams, or bay quahaugs caught by the licensee to the waters from which they were taken. Any licensed boat may be used in dredging for mussels by the licensee of that boat, the licensee having first obtained a permit from the director of environmental management allowing the licensee so to do; provided, the licensee, while dredging for mussels under the permit granted the licensee by the director, shall immediately return all oysters, scallops, or bay quahaugs caught by him or her to the waters from which they were taken. The fact of any licensed person being found with oysters, scallops, or bay quahaugs in his or her possession while dredging for mussels shall be prima facie evidence that person was fishing in violation of the provisions of this chapter and shall be subject to the penalties and fines imposed by this chapter. Any resident dredging for surf clams or skimmers shall not be in violation of this section if that dredging is done southerly of the coastline of Little Compton, southerly of a line extending from Church point, in the town of Little Compton, to Flint point on Aquidneck Island, southerly of the coastline of Aquidneck Island, southerly of a line extending from Castle Hill point on Aquidneck Island, to southwest point of Conanicut Island to Bonnet point, Narragansett, easterly of the coastline of the town of Narragansett, southerly of the coastline of the towns of Narragansett, South Kingstown, and Charlestown, and westerly to the Connecticut line. For the purpose of this section, “coastline” refers to the land facing the open sea.

      In making a determination that an area is polluted, the director shall ensure consistency with the requirements of the National Shellfish Sanitation Program. When necessary, for consistency with National Shellfish Sanitation Program requirements, the director may declare an area to be polluted in the absence of monitoring data if the director has evidence that the area may become polluted. A review of the status of all the areas in the state shall be made by the director on at least an annual basis.

       Taking or selling shellfish from polluted areas.

     </h3>
     <p>
      No person shall take shellfish from the waters of polluted areas, or knowingly sell shellfish taken from the waters of polluted areas, except pursuant to a transplant program specifically authorized by and conducted under the direct supervision of the director. In granting permission, the department of environmental management shall first obtain the written approval of the director of the department of health as to the suitability and safety for the purposes intended. The possession by any person of shellfish while in a vessel upon the waters of polluted areas between the hours of two (2) hours after sunset and sunrise shall be prima facie evidence that those shellfish were taken by that person in violation of this section.

      Whereas, R.I. Const., Art. I, Sec. 17, guarantees to the people the right to enjoy and freely exercise all rights of fishery, and imposes on the general assembly the responsibility to provide for the conservation of water, plant, and animal resources of the state; and
     </p>

      Whereas, the process of aquaculture is a proper and effective method to cultivate plant and animal life; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Whereas, the process of aquaculture should only be conducted within the waters of the state in a manner consistent with the best public interest, with particular consideration given to the effect of aquaculture on other uses of the free and common fishery and navigation, and the compatibility of aquaculture with the environment of the waters of the state; therefore,
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the public policy of this state to preserve the waters of this state as free and common fishery. The health, welfare, environment, and general wellbeing of the people of the state require that the state restrict the uses of its waters and the land thereunder for aquaculture and, in the exercise of the police power, the waters of the state and land thereunder are to be regulated under this chapter.

The CRMC shall immediately order all permittees affected by that notice to show cause why their aquaculture activities should not be terminated, and any aquaculture species or paraphernalia removed from the waters of the state. The CRMC shall proceed to hold a public hearing and issue its order with respect to the hearing, within a reasonable period. In its order following the hearing, the CRMC may direct the temporary or permanent suspension of aquaculture activities in the affected area, removal of equipment or animals, or any other measures as shall be deemed necessary for the protection of the marine life and environment of the waters of the state, including the forfeiture to, and destruction by, the state of any plant or animal species.

Any resident or nonresident holder of a hunting license or combination license may obtain a shotgun, muzzle-loading rifle, or crossbow, or archery deer tag from the director. The deer permit shall be carried at all times by the person to whom it is issued while hunting for deer. Any person who takes a deer in this state shall immediately affix his or her tag portion of his or her deer permit to the carcass of the taken deer, and, within twenty-four (24) hours of the taking, convey the deer to an environmental police officer or other designee of the department, or to a deer-check station, if one is in operation at the time, for checking. Any dead deer found not having a tag attached to it identifying the owner shall be the property of the state and shall be seized by any environmental police officer who finds or locates the carcass, to be disposed of by direction of the director.

       Any person owning or occupying any property, and any employee of that person, while on that person’s premises, may kill any deer found destroying any crops, vegetables, or fruit trees, or otherwise causing damage to that property; provided, however, that this person shall not kill any deer unless he or she has obtained a permit from the director to do so. The director, on application, may issue the permit to any responsible owner, or the owner’s employee, provided that no such permit shall be issued until the director has determined that actual damage has been done to crops, vegetables, fruit trees, or other property by any deer, and that no practical alternative to the shooting of the deer is available. This permit shall be issued on an annual basis at a fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00). Any person taking or wounding a deer under the permit shall report the taking or wounding to a conservation officer or other designee of the director within twenty-four (24) hours of the taking or wounding.

A night hunting permit may be issued by the director to any responsible owner, or the owner’s employee, provided that no such permit shall be issued until the director has determined that actual damage has been done to crops, vegetables, fruit trees, or other property by any deer, and that no practical alternative to the shooting of the deer is available.

      Whereas the state of Rhode Island recognizes that a diversified, stable, clean, and aesthetically satisfying natural environment is essential to the health, safety, and welfare of the people of Rhode Island; and

     <p>
      Whereas such an environment contributes significantly to economic and social development and progress and is also of high value for educational, scientific, recreational, and other purposes; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Whereas it is further recognized that the continued existence of this natural environment within Rhode Island is dependent upon the maintenance of a high order of diversity of life forms within that environment and is equally dependent upon the maintenance of sufficient and suitable natural habitat in which a diverse fauna and flora can reproduce, find food, shelter, and clean soil, water, and air and carry out those functions essential to sustain their existences; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Whereas it is recognized that in addition to appropriate habitat, diversity and numbers of species and individuals in native faunal and floral populations is the key to maintaining a healthy, stable, and productive natural environment within which the citizens of Rhode Island can function; and
     </p>
     <p>
      Whereas it is acknowledged that Rhode Island has a distinctive natural community of living things worthy of protection for its own sake and for the use and benefits of its people; and

      It is hereby declared to be the intent of the state of Rhode Island, to provide a means by which “nongame wildlife” research and management may be financed through a voluntary checkoff of a portion of an income tax refund owed to a taxpayer by the state. It is also intended that funds generated by the checkoff be supplemental to any funds that would otherwise be available for the above purposes, and that the funds be used only for “nongame wildlife” research and management.

      No person shall buy, sell, offer for sale, store, transport, import, export, or otherwise traffic in any animal or plant, or any part of any animal or plant, whether living, dead, processed, manufactured, preserved, or raw if the animal or plant has been declared to be an endangered species by either the United States Secretaries of the Interior or Commerce or the director of the Rhode Island department of environmental management. The only exception to these prohibitions shall be for purposes of scientific research or educational display either of which must be done by or under the formal supervision of a legitimate college or university and then only upon the issuance of a special permit for each individual excepted species. The permit may be issued by the director of environmental management. The permit will be denied by the director if, in his or her opinion, issuance of the permit would not be entirely justified or entirely in the best interests of preservation and protection of the species involved. Under no circumstances will a permit be granted for exception if commercial considerations are involved in any way.

         <li id="t20c39s20-39-1aIol1a2">
          The protection of the wildlife resources of a state is materially affected by the degree of compliance with state statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances, and administrative rules relating to the management of such resources.
         </li>
         <li id="t20c39s20-39-1aIol1a3">
          The preservation, protection, management, and restoration of wildlife contributes immeasurably to the aesthetic, recreational, and economic aspects of such natural resources.
         </li>
         <li id="t20c39s20-39-1aIol1a4">
          Wildlife resources are valuable without regard to political boundaries; therefore, every person should be required to comply with wildlife preservation, protection, management, and restoration laws, ordinances, and administrative rules and regulations of the participating states as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license to hunt, fish, trap, or possess wildlife.
         </li>
         <li id="t20c39s20-39-1aIol1a5">
          Violation of wildlife laws interferes with the management of wildlife resources and may endanger the safety of persons and property.

         <li id="t20c39s20-39-1aIol1a6">
          The mobility of many wildlife law violators necessitates the maintenance of channels of communication among the various states.

         <li id="t20c39s20-39-1aIol1a7">
          In most instances, a person who is cited for a wildlife violation in a state other than his/her home state:

            Is required to post collateral or a bond to secure appearance for a trial at a later date; or

         <li id="t20c39s20-39-1aIol1a8">
          The purpose of the enforcement practices set forth in subdivision (7) is to ensure compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation by the cited person who, if permitted to continue on his/her way after receiving the citation, could return to his/her home state and disregard his/her duty under the terms of the citation.
         </li>
         <li id="t20c39s20-39-1aIol1a9">
          In most instances, a person receiving a wildlife citation in his/her home state is permitted to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and immediately continue on his/her way after agreeing or being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation.
         </li>
         <li id="t20c39s20-39-1aIol1a10">
          The practices described in subdivision (7) cause unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the person who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial, or pay a fine, and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some alternative arrangement is made.

         <li id="t20c39s20-39-1aIol1a11">
