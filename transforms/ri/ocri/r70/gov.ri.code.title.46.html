       It is the policy of the state of Rhode Island that the state’s permission to fill tidelands is separate and distinct from the state’s granting of a right, title, or interest in and to the resulting filled area. Furthermore, it is the policy of the state of Rhode Island that the state permission to use tidal lands is separate and distinct from the state’s conveyance of its fee title estate, or any real estate interest, in the tidal lands. Any title to a free hold estate may be conveyed only by a valid legislative grant for public trust purposes by direct enactment of the general assembly as specified in this chapter. Moreover, any leasehold interest or license to use those lands may only arise under the authority of the general assembly whether exercised by the general assembly itself or exercised pursuant to a valid delegation to a duly authorized instrumentality of the state. Any state permission to use tidal lands belonging to the state shall be deemed to create only a revocable license interest unless a greater interest is clearly intended by the permission and the requirements of this chapter for the creation of that greater interest are met.

       It is intended that there shall be no acquiring of any right or title whatsoever to these public lands by adverse possession or by a acquiescence of the sovereign. It is further intended that there shall be no acquiring of any right or title to any freehold estate to these public lands by any permit or approval to conduct fill activity, however denominated or manifested, or by any other means, including through the leasing and licensing of these public lands, except solely by grant and enactment of the general assembly as provided in this chapter for a use that benefits the public under the public trust doctrine. Without impairing any right, title, or interest that may have previously vested, any placement of fill to a harbor line or other filling of tidal lands, which has not been commenced and completed as of the date of the enactment of this section [July 18, 2000], shall not be effective as conveying the state’s title nor as a limitation on the public trust.

       The state of Rhode Island, pursuant to the public trust doctrine long recognized in federal and Rhode Island state case law, and to Article 1, § 17 of the Constitution of Rhode Island as originally adopted and as subsequently amended, has historically maintained title in fee simple to all soil within its boundaries that lies below the high water mark and to any land resulting from any filling of any tidal area, except those portions of tidal lands or filled tidal lands in respect to which the state has formally granted title in fee simple to private individuals or to which title has been otherwise acquired by private individuals by judicially recognized mechanisms prior to the effective date of this section [July 18, 2000]. Subsequent to the effective date of this section [July 18, 2000], no title to any freehold estate in any tidal land or filled land can be acquired by any private individual unless it is formally conveyed by explicit grant of the state by the general assembly for public trust purposes.

The general assembly has the responsibility and the sole authority to arrive at, and define, by its enactment, a policy balance between or among the competing proposed uses or developments for tidal lands and the respective competing assertions concerning the public interests in those lands, and that determination shall be deemed to be, and be accepted as, the authoritative definition of the public interest in relation to the preservation and use of tidal lands.

Upon the filing of the petition, the court shall cause twenty (20) days’ notice of the pendency thereof to be given to the department of environmental management by serving its director with a certified copy thereof, and, thereafterwards, the cause shall be conducted as other civil actions of law are tried including the right to except rulings, to move for a new trial and prosecute an appeal, and, upon recovery of final judgment therein, execution shall be issued therefor and shall forthwith be paid by the general treasurer out of the funds appropriated and available therefor, but the verdict and the judgment entered thereon shall not include any item of interest for any period during which such land is actually occupied or enjoyed by the owner or owners thereof. In case two (2) or more petitioners make claim to the same land or to any estate or interest therein or to different estates or interests in the same parcel of land, the court shall, upon motion, consolidate their several petitions for trial and frame all necessary issues therefor.

       After taking possession of a vessel or other obstruction, pursuant to the terms and conditions of §§ 46-6-9 and 46-9-10, the authorized public entity may use or dispose of the vessel or other obstruction in any appropriate and environmentally sound manner without further notice to any owners, but must give preference to uses that derive some monetary benefit from the vessel or other obstruction, either in whole or in scrap. If no value can be derived from the vessel or other obstruction, the authorized public entity must give preference to the least costly, environmentally sound, reasonable disposal option.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c06s46-6-10.1ol1b">
       If the authorized public entity chooses to offer the vessel or other obstruction for sale at public auction, either a minimum bid may be set or a letter of credit may be required, or both, to discourage future re-abandonment of the vessel or other obstruction.

      <li id="t46c06s46-6-10.1ol1c">
       Proceeds derived from the sale of the vessel or other obstruction must first be applied to any administrative costs that are incurred by the authorized public entity during the notification procedures set forth in § 46-6-9, removal and disposal costs, and costs associated with environmental damages directly or indirectly caused by the vessel or other obstruction. If the proceeds derived from the sale of the vessel or other obstruction exceed all such costs, the remaining moneys must be applied to satisfying any liens registered against the vessel or other obstruction.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c06s46-6-10.1ol1d">
       Any value derived from the sale of a vessel greater than all liens and costs incurred shall revert to the derelict and abandoned vessel and obstruction removal account established in § 46-6-10.3.

        Where state official in charge of preventing water pollution had 3,586 reports of alleged pollution, out of which all but 70 of said reports had been checked out, there were 3,516 instances where said official was custodian of records that are open to the public notwithstanding that in 1,153 instances of this number corrective action was ordered and the public was also entitled to know the number of complaints yet unchecked and the dates when they were received.

        Although state official in charge of preventing water pollution is not required to make known the names of persons regarding whom allegations of pollution have been made until he has an opportunity to acquire personal knowledge of the facts, he is required to make known the facts ascertained as well as such further steps that he is taking and this means that there are records which are open for public inspection, even though corrective measures are still being explored.

        Complaints, accusations and allegations that this or that person is polluting the waters of the state, are not, until checked out, cause to believe that the person complained of is in fact polluting or apt to pollute waters of the state but such a complaint does place on the state official charged with preventing water pollution the burden of determining what the facts are, and having made this determination, make a record of the same that is then open to the public regardless of whether the complaint was found to be valid or totally lacking in merit.

     <p>
      The legislature finds and declares that the release of oil or hazardous substances into the environment presents a real and substantial threat to the public health and welfare, to the environment, and to the economy of the state. The legislature therefore concludes that it is in the best interest of the state and its citizens to provide a readily available fund for the payment of expenses that the department of environmental management incurs in the protection of the environment of the state from the release of oil. The legislature further recognizes the considerable hardships which may be incurred by the citizens of the state as a direct result of the release of oil into the environment, and therefore the legislature concludes that it is in the best interest of the state to expand the scope of the fund to allow claims from citizens, in certain instances, and to provide for the disbursal of emergency loans from the fund. The legislature lastly concludes that preparedness is an essential component of prevention of and response to oil spill events and, therefore, the purpose of the fund shall be further expanded to support activities which will directly benefit the state in the event of future oil spill events.

       A uniform oil spill response and prevention fee in an amount not exceeding five cents ($.05) for each barrel of petroleum products, as set by the director pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, shall be imposed upon every person owning petroleum products at the time the petroleum products are received at a marine terminal within this state by means of a vessel from a point of origin outside this state. The fee shall be remitted to the division of taxation on the 30th day of each month based upon the number of barrels of petroleum products received during the preceding month.

       Every owner of petroleum products shall be liable for the fee until it has been paid to the state, except that payment to a marine terminal operator registered under this chapter is sufficient to relieve the owner from further liability for the fee; provided, however, that the fee for asphalt products and asphalt derivatives shall be one cent ($.01) per barrel of asphalt products or derivatives.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c12.7s46-12.7-4.1ol1c">
       Whenever the director, in consultation with the department and the division of taxation, estimates that the amount in the fund will reach the amount specified in subsection (e) of this section, and the money in the fund is not required for the purposes specified in § 46-12.7-5.1, the director shall instruct the division of taxation to cease collecting the fee.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c12.7s46-12.7-4.1ol1d">
       The director shall set the amount of the oil spill prevention and response fees. The administrator, except for the fee set out in subsection (b), shall not set the amount of the fee at less than five cents ($0.05) for each barrel of petroleum products or crude oil, unless the director finds that the assessment of a lesser fee will cause the fund to reach the designated amount within six (6) months.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c12.7s46-12.7-4.1ol1e">
       For the purposes of this chapter,   “designated amount” means an amount equal to ten million dollars ($10,000,000), adjusted for inflation after January 1, 1998, according to an index which the director may reasonably choose.

        Since the intended purpose of the oil spill prevention fund statute is the prevention of oil spills and of the discharge of petroleum by-products into the environment, a determination by the administrative agency charged with the enforcement of the statute that a tire fire at a particular site would produce thousands of gallons of oil and petroleum by-products that eventually would be discharged into the Narragansett Bay, and that the fund should be used to remove the tires from the site, was a reasonable interpretation of the statute.

       The agency may provide by resolution of the board of directors for the issuance, from time to time, of bonds, notes or any other evidences of indebtedness of the agency for any of its corporate purposes or for the borrowing of money in anticipation of the issuance of the bonds. Bonds issued by the agency may be issued as general obligations of the agency or as special obligations payable solely from particular revenues or funds as may be provided for in any trust agreement or other agreement securing bonds. The agency may also provide by resolution of the board of directors for the issuance, from time to time, of temporary notes in anticipation of the revenues to be collected or received by the agency, including, without limitation, in anticipation of any payments to the agency from the state, or in anticipation of the receipt of other grants or aid. The issue of notes shall be governed by the provisions of this chapter relating to the issue of bonds of the agency other than temporary notes as this chapter may be applicable; provided, however, that notes issued in anticipation of revenues shall mature no later than one year from their respective dates, or the date of expected receipt of the revenues, if later, and notes issued in anticipation of grants, or other aid and renewals thereof, shall mature no later than six (6) months after the expected date of receipt of the grant or aid.

       The bonds of each issue shall be dated, may bear interest at such rate or rates, including rates variable from time to time as determined by such index, banker’s loan rate, or other method determined by the agency, and shall mature or otherwise be payable at such time or times, as may be determined by the agency, and may be made redeemable before maturity at the option of the agency or the holder thereof at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the agency. The agency shall determine the form of bonds, and the manner of execution of the bonds, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds, and the place or places of payment of principal, redemption premium, if any, and interest, which may be paid at any bank or trust company within or without the state. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds shall cease to be the officer before the delivery thereof, the signature or facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes as if the officer had remained in office until delivery. The agency may provide for authentication of bonds by a trustee, fiscal agent, registrar, or transfer agency. Bonds may be issued in bearer or in registered form, or both, and if notes, may be made payable to the bearer or to order, as the agency may determine. The agency may also establish and maintain a system of registration for any bonds whereby the name of the registered owner, the rights evidenced by the bonds, the transfer of the bonds, and the rights and other similar matters, are recorded in books or other records maintained by or on behalf of the agency, and no instrument evidencing the bonds or rights need be delivered to the registered owner by the agency. A copy of the books or other records of the agency pertaining to any bond registered under a registration system certified by an authorized officer of the agency or by the agent of the agency maintaining the system shall be admissible in any proceeding without further authentication. The board of directors may by resolution delegate to any member or officer of the agency, or any combination thereof, the power to determine any of the matters set forth in this section. In the discretion of the agency, bonds of the agency may be issued with such terms as will cause the interest thereon to be subject to federal income taxation. The agency may sell its bonds in such manner, either at public or private sale, for the price, at the rate or rates of interest, or at discount in lieu of interest, as it may determine will best affect the purposes of this chapter.

The agency, by itself or through such agency as it may select, may purchase and invite offers to tender for purchase any bonds of the agency at any time outstanding; provided, however, that no purchase by the agency shall be made at a price, exclusive of accrued interest, if any, exceeding the principal amount thereof or, if greater, the redemption price of the bonds when next redeemable at the option of the agency, and may resell any bonds so purchased in such manner and for such price as it may determine will best effect the purposes of this chapter.

The trust agreement may pledge or assign, in whole or in part, any loan agreements and local governmental obligations, and the revenues, funds, and other assets or property held or to be received by the agency, including without limitation all moneys and investments on deposit from time to time in the safe drinking water revolving loan fund, and any contract or other rights to receive the same, whether then existing or thereafter coming into existence and whether then held or thereafter acquired by the agency, and the proceeds thereof. The trust agreement may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights, security, and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, provisions defining defaults and providing for remedies in the event thereof which may include the acceleration of maturities, restrictions on the individual right of action by bondholders, and covenants setting forth the duties of and limitations on the agency in relation to the custody, safeguarding, investment, and application of moneys, the enforcement of loan agreements and local governmental obligations, the issue of additional or refunding bonds, the fixing, revision, charging, and collection of charges, the use of any surplus bond proceeds, the establishment of reserves, and the making and amending of contracts.

      The agency may issue refunding bonds for the purpose of paying any of its bonds issued pursuant to this chapter at or prior to maturity or upon acceleration or redemption or purchase and retirement. Refunding bonds may be issued at such times at or prior to the maturity, redemption, or purchase and retirement of the refunded bonds as the board of directors deems to be in the interest of the agency. Refunding bonds may be issued in sufficient amounts to pay or provide for payment of the principal of the bonds being refunded, together with any redemption premium thereon, any interest or discount accrued or to accrue to the date of payment of the bonds, the costs of issuance of the refunding bonds, the expenses of paying, redeeming, or purchasing the bonds being refunded, the costs of holding and investing proceeds of refunding bonds pending payment, redemption, or purchase and reserves for debt service or other expenses from the proceeds of refunding bonds as may be required by a trust agreement securing the bonds. Pending application, the proceeds of the refunding bonds may be placed in escrow. The issue and sale of refunding bonds, the maturities, and other details thereof, the security therefor, the rights of the holders thereof, and the rights, duties, and obligations of the agency in respect of the same shall be governed by the provisions of this chapter relating to the issue of bonds other than refunding bonds insofar as this chapter may be applicable.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The general assembly finds: (1) That a state administered underground storage tank (UST) clean-up fund is needed to provide an effective mechanism for USTs owners to comply with financial responsibility requirements and to insure that the environmental and public health impacts of UST leaks are addressed in an effective and timely manner.
     </p>
     <p>
      (2)
      Certain tank owners must be able to demonstrate one million dollars ($1,000,000) of liability coverage to satisfy the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (40 CFR Part 280.90 et seq., as published in the Federal Register dated October 26, 1988 and by Final Rule dated February 18, 1993). Specifically the EPA requirement is that certain tank owners must demonstrate financial responsibility of up to one million dollars ($1,000,000) per incident and up to two million dollars ($2,000,000) in the aggregate for damages. Failure by the state to create a state-sponsored fund will result in enforcement action by the EPA which can include both financial penalties against tank owners and closure of tanks, if the owner fails to demonstrate financial responsibility.
     </p>
     <p>
      (3)
      The Rhode Island economic development corporation recently concluded that failure by the state of Rhode Island to enact a state fund will adversely impact the state’s economy by eighteen million dollars ($18,000,000) annually.

       There is hereby imposed an environmental protection regulatory fee of one cent ($0.01) per gallon payable of motor fuel, to be collected by distributors of motor fuel when the product is sold to owners and/or operators of underground storage tanks. Each distributor shall be responsible to the tax administrator for the collection of the regulatory fee, and if the distributor is unable to recover the fee from the person who ordered the product, the distributor shall nonetheless remit to the tax administrator the regulatory fee associated with the delivery. In accordance with the regulations to be promulgated hereunder, the fee shall be collected, reported, and paid to the Rhode Island division of taxation as a separate, line-item entry, on a quarterly tax report by those persons charged with the collection, reporting, and payment of motor fuels taxes. This fee shall be administered and collected by the division of taxation. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the fee shall not be applicable to purchases by the United States government.

All environmental protection regulatory fees paid to the department shall be received by the department, which shall keep such money in a distinct, interest-bearing, restricted-receipt account to the credit of, and for the exclusive use of, the fund provided that for the period January 1, 2008, through June 30, 2008, all revenues generated by the environmental protection regulatory fee, up to a maximum of two million dollars ($2,000,000), shall be deposited into the general fund. In fiscal year 2009, all revenues generated by the environmental protection regulatory fee, up to a maximum equivalent to two million two hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred dollars ($2,237,500), shall be deposited into the intermodal surface transportation fund. All fees collected may be invested as provided by law and all interest received on such investment shall be credited to the fund.

       When the fund reaches the sum of eight million dollars ($8,000,000), the imposition of the fee set forth in this chapter shall be suspended, and the division of taxation shall notify all persons responsible for the collection, reporting, and payments of the fee of the suspension. In the event that the account balance of the fund subsequently is reduced to a sum less than five million dollars ($5,000,000) as a result of fund activity, the fee shall be reinstated by the division of taxation, following proper notice thereof, and once reinstated, the collection, reporting, and payment of the fee shall continue until the account balance again reaches the sum of eight million dollars ($8,000,000).

       Upon the determination by the advisory board and the department that the fund has reached a balance sufficient to satisfy all pending or future claims, the advisory board shall recommend to the general assembly the discontinuation of the imposition of the fee created in this section.

     <ol>
      <li id="t46c12.11s46-12.11-1ol11">
       The bays, rivers, and associated watersheds of Rhode Island are unique and unparalleled natural resources that provide significant cultural, ecological, and economic benefit to the state, and it is in the best interest of the state and its citizens to preserve, protect, and restore our bays, rivers, and associated watersheds.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c12.11s46-12.11-1ol12">
       The formation of the Rhode Island Bays, Rivers, and Watersheds Coordination Team, pursuant to chapter 46-31 of the general laws, provides for the coordination of the functions, programs, and regulations that affect the bays, rivers, and watersheds and serves as the most effective way to transcend the limited responsibilities and jurisdictions of each agency, to address complex issues using an ecosystem-based approach, and to provide for continuity over time.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c12.11s46-12.11-1ol13">
       Discharges of wastewater from wastewater treatment facilities, despite the fact that these discharges are carefully regulated and monitored, are known sources of pollution that affect the water quality of the bays, rivers, and associated watersheds of Rhode Island.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c12.11s46-12.11-1ol14">
       Wastewater treatment facilities collect wastewater both from users of sewer systems, who pay fees for the utilization of the systems, and from septage transporters, who collect septage from users of onsite sewage disposal systems.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c12.11s46-12.11-1ol15">
       All persons or entities generating pollutants that affect Rhode Island’s bays, rivers and watersheds, including those who utilize onsite sewage disposal systems, should be required to contribute to the costs of providing effective pollution control, mitigating environmental degradation of ecosystems, restoring impaired ecosystems, and monitoring the environment to characterize the impacts of the pollutant loadings, including changes that may occur as the level of treatment is improved.

       For the purpose of protecting existing, proposed, or potential drinking water supplies, the director shall conduct a survey of all groundwater sources and related groundwater aquifers, watersheds, and deep flow recharge areas. Upon completion of the survey, the director shall designate the groundwater sources under one of the following classifications:
       <ol>
        <li id="t46c13.1s46-13.1-4ol1a1">
         GAA — groundwater sources suitable for public drinking water use without treatment;

        <li id="t46c13.1s46-13.1-4ol1a3">
         GB — groundwater sources which may not be suitable for public or private drinking water without treatment due to known or presumed degradation;
        </li>
        <li id="t46c13.1s46-13.1-4ol1a4">
         GC — groundwater sources which may be suitable for certain waste disposal practices because past or present land use or hydrogeologic conditions render the groundwaters more suitable for receiving permitted discharges than for development as public or private water supply.

       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t46c13.1s46-13.1-4ol1b">
       The director shall develop water quality standards for each classification which specify maximum contaminant levels for each classification. The approach for establishing the water quality standards shall include appropriate criteria established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency to protect the uses of groundwater as designated by the director. Water quality standards shall be used to promote restoration of groundwater to drinking water quality without treatment except where the groundwater is:
       <ol>
        <li id="t46c13.1s46-13.1-4ol1b1">

      <li id="t46c13.1s46-13.1-4ol1c">
       The director shall also develop a preventive action limit for each maximum contaminant level for each classification. In determining the percentage of the maximum contaminant level to be used as a preventive action limit for each contaminant, the director shall take into account whether the contaminant is a toxic pollutant and, if so, whether it has carcinogenic, mutagenic, or teratogenic properties or interactive effects. The director shall promulgate rules setting forth the range of responses that he or she may take, or that he or she may require the person, corporation, or other entity controlling a facility, activity, or practice that is a source of the contaminant to take, if the preventive action limit is attained or exceeded. The responses shall be designed to:
       <ol>
        <li id="t46c13.1s46-13.1-4ol1c1">
         Minimize the concentration of the contaminant in the groundwater where technically and economically feasible;
        </li>
        <li id="t46c13.1s46-13.1-4ol1c2">
         Regain and maintain compliance with the preventive action limit, unless the director determines that the preventive action limit is either not technically or not economically feasible, in which case he or she shall achieve compliance with the lowest possible concentration that is technically and economically feasible; and
        </li>
        <li id="t46c13.1s46-13.1-4ol1c3">
         Ensure that the maximum contaminant level is not attained or exceeded.

      The general assembly hereby finds and declares that:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t46c15s46-15-1ol11">
       The state of Rhode Island has been endowed with many and abundant sources of water supplies located advantageously, for the most part, throughout the state. The proper development, protection, conservation, and use of these water resources are essential to the health, safety, and welfare of the general public, and to the continued growth and economic development of the state;
      </li>
      <li id="t46c15s46-15-1ol12">
       In recent years it has become increasingly apparent that water supply management, protection, development, and use must be fully integrated into all statewide planning, and rivers and watershed planning and management processes, and that the allocation of the state’s water resources to all users, purposes, and functions, including water to sustain our natural river and stream systems and natural biotic communities, must be equitably decided and implemented under a process which emphasizes efficiency of use and management, minimization of waste, protection of existing supplies, demand management, drought management, conservation, and all other techniques to ensure that our water resources serve the people of Rhode Island for the longest time, in the most efficient use, and in an environmentally sound manner;
      </li>
      <li id="t46c15s46-15-1ol13">
       The character and extent of the problems of water resource development, utilization, and control, and the widespread and complex interests which they affect, demand action by the government of the state of Rhode Island in order to deal with these problems in a manner which adequately protects the general welfare of all the citizens of the state;
      </li>
      <li id="t46c15s46-15-1ol14">
       In order to retain and encourage the expansion of our present industries, and to attract new industries, and to promote the proper growth and desirable economic growth of the entire state, and to sustain the viability of water resource-dependent natural systems, agriculture, and recreation, state government must play an active role in fostering and guiding the management of water resources;
      </li>
      <li id="t46c15s46-15-1ol15">
       There are state and municipal departments, special districts, private firms, and other agencies in the state who have capabilities and experience in the design, construction, operation, and financing of water supply and transmission facilities, which capabilities and experience must be brought to bear on the total problem of water resources development in a coordinated manner if the proper development, conservation, apportionment, and use of the water resources of the state are to be realized; and
      </li>
      <li id="t46c15s46-15-1ol16">
       It shall be the duty of the water resources board to regulate the proper development, protection, conservation and use of the water resources of the state.

      The general assembly finds and declares that:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t46c15.2s46-15.2-2ol11">
       A number of Rhode Island municipalities periodically suffer water shortages severe enough to require usage curtailments as a result of droughts.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c15.2s46-15.2-2ol12">
       The limited water supply systems and sources of these municipalities, burdened by rising water usage caused by growth and development, will encounter increasing difficulties coping with short-term climatologically caused shortages.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c15.2s46-15.2-2ol13">
       The quality of water supplies of a number of municipalities are threatened by development and by contamination.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c15.2s46-15.2-2ol14">
       Population growth, commercial and industrial development, and patterns of higher water consumption have forced some communities to abandon or supplement their inadequate or contaminated original sources of water, and to develop new supplies of water often located beyond their borders and outside their original service areas.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c15.2s46-15.2-2ol15">
       It has become evident that individual water systems serving the public often no longer have the financial resources to find and develop adequate new water supplies. The costs of constructing aqueducts, major transmission lines, and pumping stations to deliver water to communities from remote sources, and the difficulties in acquiring rights-of-way, overwhelm most communities and indicate the need for state involvement.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c15.2s46-15.2-2ol16">
       Water of high quality is a sufficiently abundant resource in Rhode Island that enough water can be made available to meet all the needs of each Rhode Islander through the foreseeable future provided that water can be conveyed to the communities and water systems in need from remote sources.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c15.2s46-15.2-2ol17">
       The water resources board was established in 1967 and charged with the responsibility of acquiring and developing new major water supplies for the people of Rhode Island. The Rhode Island water facilities assistance program enables the water resources board to assist public water systems in obtaining and delivering potable water to meet present and future needs throughout the state of Rhode Island.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c15.2s46-15.2-2ol18">
       The water resources board and other existing agencies of state government have adequate capability and authority to carry out this program without the creation of new agencies.

       Water facilities assistance program established — Eligibility.

      <li id="t46c15.2s46-15.2-4ol1a">
       There is hereby established in the water resources board a Rhode Island water facilities assistance program. The board shall administer this program so as to ensure the proper and systematic development of coordinated water supply and transmission facilities and shall expend the funds available under this chapter in a manner that accomplishes this objective.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c15.2s46-15.2-4ol1b">
       This program shall provide twenty-five percent (25%) of the cost of approved water transmission facilities designed and constructed to serve a single water system, and shall provide fifty percent (50%) of the cost of approved intersystem facilities. Only the construction of water transmission and intersystem facilities and the acquisition of land or rights-of-way, together with necessary engineering and design, are eligible for assistance under this program. Costs of borrowing, amortization costs, legal, and all other costs attendant to the funding of water transmission and intersystem facilities are not eligible for financial assistance under this program and must be fully borne by the project applicant. The cost of distribution facilities as defined in this chapter are not eligible for financial assistance under this program. Determinations of project eligibility shall be made by the water resources board.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c15.2s46-15.2-4ol1c">
       Only municipalities and quasi municipal water agencies are eligible to apply for assistance under this program. Determinations of applicant eligibility shall be made by the water resources board.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c15.2s46-15.2-4ol1d">
       Only projects reviewed and approved by the water resources board, the division of public utilities and carriers, and the state planning council may be funded. Each project supported by this program must be consistent with a plan adopted and kept current by the water resources board in accordance with § 46-15-6 and with applicable elements of the state guide plan, as adopted and kept current by the state planning council in accordance with § 42-11-10(c); provided, however, that with respect to any project which has been approved by the board and which thereafter becomes eligible to participate as an intersystem facilities project, the submission to, and approval by, the public utilities commission and statewide planning council shall not be required.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c15.2s46-15.2-4ol1e">
       Each transmission facility supported by this program must link a water source with a water distribution system, both of which are complete and operational or will be so at the time that the transmission facility is completed or is projected for future construction. The capacity of both the water source and the distribution system must be adequate to meet present and future needs, considering all other demands that may be placed on the same sources and distribution systems. All determinations required under this subsection shall be made in a timely fashion by the water resources board.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c15.2s46-15.2-4ol1f">
       The quality of water to be conveyed through the proposed transmission system must meet the Rhode Island department of health requirements for the most restrictive current or planned use. All reasonable measures to assure that this level of water quality will be maintained must have been taken.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c15.2s46-15.2-4ol1g">
       The design and construction of an approved transmission facility must ensure that it will remain operational for its design life with routine maintenance, and that it will resist all external and internal forces that can be reasonably anticipated as determined by the water resources board.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c15.2s46-15.2-4ol1h">
       The water resources board will ensure that maintenance of the transmission facility is performed in a manner that ensures that it will remain operational throughout its design life and is assured by a dedicated revenue such as a user fee or some other equally reliable means.

         Water is vital to life and comprises an invaluable natural resource which is not to be abused by any segment of the state’s population or its economy. It is the policy of this state to restore, enhance, and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of its waters to protect public health;

         Development of land areas near to supplies of drinking water and related construction can threaten the quality of those supplies and, therefore, can endanger public health; thus it is necessary to take immediate and continuing steps to protect the watersheds of surface waters and the reservoirs and recharge areas of ground waters from land uses and activities which may degrade the quality of public drinking water;

         The decay of infrastructure and related construction due to deterioration or functional obsolescence can threaten the quality of supplies and, therefore, can endanger public health; thus it is necessary to take immediate and continuing steps to repair and replace the infrastructure used to deliver water supplies in order to restore water system facilities.

       The general assembly finds and declares that:
       <ol>
        <li id="t46c15.8s46-15.8-2ol1a1">
         Rhode Island is fortunate to have sufficient precipitation to meet Rhode Island’s water needs, if that water is not wasted and if it is well and fairly managed. With scarcity of water a growing concern for many southern and western states, Rhode Island’s adequate water supply can and should be an economic advantage for our state;
        </li>
        <li id="t46c15.8s46-15.8-2ol1a2">
         Water is a renewable but a limited resource essential to the survival of all living things. The mission of the water supply profession is to provide a reliable supply of high quality water for the protection of public health, safety and welfare, and to ensure a sustainable balance between human and ecological water needs. Environmental stewardship and integrated water resource management, including land conservation, wetlands protection, and protecting the ecological integrity of water resources, are core values of the water supply profession and are essential to sustaining this mission;
        </li>
        <li id="t46c15.8s46-15.8-2ol1a3">
         Efficient and equitable management of our shared water resources allows us to make water available to new economic development as well as meet existing water needs, both of which support our state’s economic vitality and the quality of life of our communities;
        </li>
        <li id="t46c15.8s46-15.8-2ol1a4">
         Good management allows us to provide water for necessary residential use as well as economic growth, at the same time that we preserve and protect the natural resources that make Rhode Island such an attractive place to live, and that support important economic activity that depends upon a healthy environment, such as fisheries, farming and tourism;
        </li>
        <li id="t46c15.8s46-15.8-2ol1a5">
         Rhode Island is currently consuming large amounts of water for inefficient outdoor non-agricultural summer landscape irrigation.
        </li>
        <li id="t46c15.8s46-15.8-2ol1a6">
         More efficient use of our shared water supply, especially by residential users, makes more water available for economic activity and for replenishment of stream flow, and is usually the most cost-effective and quickest way to maximize available water supply. Conservation must be a priority for successful water management.
        </li>
        <li id="t46c15.8s46-15.8-2ol1a7">
         Rhode Island’s water supply infrastructure must be maintained if it is to continue to supply the state with clean water sufficient to meet our needs; it is far cheaper to “pay as you go” than to defer infrastructure maintenance, which will result in it being far more expensive in the future.
        </li>
        <li id="t46c15.8s46-15.8-2ol1a8">
         Municipalities should consider the water available for human use and likely water needs at build out in making planning decisions.
        </li>
        <li id="t46c15.8s46-15.8-2ol1a9">
         The Rhode Island Water Resources Board, as an independent water supply agency, is vital to the success of this legislation and will provide necessary balance in working toward the sustainability of Rhode Island’s water resources.

Where meetings are planned to discuss matters relevant to problems of water pollution control affecting only certain of the signatory states, the commission may vote to authorize special meetings of the commissioners of the states especially concerned. The commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements and shall make an annual report to the governor and the legislature of each signatory state setting forth in detail the operations and transactions conducted by it pursuant to this compact, and shall make recommendations for any legislative action deemed by it advisable, including amendments to the statutes of the signatory states which may be necessary to carry out the intent and purposes of this compact. The commission shall not incur any obligations for salaries, office, administrative, traveling or other expenses prior to the allotment of funds by the signatory states adequate to meet the same; nor shall the commission pledge the credit of any of the signatory states. Each state reserves the right to provide hereafter by law for the examination and audit of the accounts of the commission. The commission shall appoint a treasurer who may be a member of the commission, and disbursements by the commission shall be valid only when authorized by the commission and when vouchers therefor have been signed by the secretary and countersigned by the treasurer.

       It is recognized, owing to such variable factors as location, size, character and flow and the many varied uses of the waters subject to the terms of this compact, that no single standard of sewage and waste treatment and no single standard of quality of receiving waters is practical and that the degree of treatment of sewage and industrial wastes should take into account the classification of the receiving waters according to present and proposed highest use, such as for drinking water supply, industrial and agricultural uses, bathing and other recreational purposes, maintenance and propagation of fish life, shellfish culture, navigation and disposal of wastes.

       The commission shall establish reasonable physical, chemical and bacteriological standards of water quality satisfactory for various classifications of use. It is agreed that each of the signatory states through appropriate agencies will prepare a classification of its interstate waters in entirety or by portions according to present and proposed highest use and for this purpose technical experts employed by state departments of health and state water pollution control agencies are authorized to confer on questions relating to classification of interstate waters affecting two (2) or more states. Each signatory state agrees to submit its classification of its interstate waters to the commission for approval. It is agreed that after such approval all signatory states through their appropriate state health departments and water pollution control agencies will work to establish programs of treatment of sewage and industrial wastes which will meet standards established by the commission for classified waters.

      <p>
       The northeastern part of the United States is by virtue of geographic location and other characteristics a great natural resource area which, with more intense use of natural resources, increasingly requires coordinated planning as a basic ingredient of effective resource management and orderly growth of the region. The work of the New England-New York interagency committee demonstrated that a continuation and furtherance of activities such as those undertaken by it would be of great value. To this end, it is the intent of this compact to establish and provide for the operation of a joint agency for the northeast.

After the hearing and appropriate investigation, if the director determines that the movement and disposal of the materials as set forth in the application would not be in conflict with the marine ecology within or adjacent to the state’s territorial waters, and that existing fishing grounds would not be damaged or destroyed, he or she may then issue the permit to the applicant; provided, further, that a state inspector be on board the tow vessel at all times during transporting and dumping operations to assure compliance with the terms contained in the permit. The state inspector shall be a qualified sailor selected by the director of the department of environmental management. Inspector’s wages will be determined on the basis of the current rate for comparable work. Wages will be paid to inspectors from the general treasury. However, all wages to be paid to inspectors will be paid to the state in advance by the person or firm requesting the permit. The director may revoke the permit at any time for sufficient cause.

         Antifoulant paints containing tributyltin based biocides are widely used on vessels in the state to inhibit the growth of marine fouling organisms, such as barnacles, that increase drag and reduce vessel speed and fuel and operating efficiency;

         The United States Environmental Protection Agency has determined that concentrations of tributyltin currently in the waters of the United States may pose unreasonable risks to oysters, clams, fish, and other marine life;

         The continued unrestricted use of tributyltin based antifoulant paints in this state poses a threat to commercially important fish and shellfish species and may ultimately pose a threat to public health;

         Vessels less than sixty-five (65) meters in length that are coated with tributyltin antifoulant paint account for a substantial amount of the tributyltin released into the aquatic environment, especially in restricted bays and inlets where tributyltin concentrations are most likely to build to dangerous levels; and

And if in the judgment of the director the dam or reservoir be not sufficiently strong to resist the pressure of water upon it, or if from any other cause the director shall determine the dam or reservoir to be unsafe, or if in his or her judgment there is reasonable cause to believe that danger to life or property may be apprehended from the unsafe dam or reservoir, the director shall determine whether the water in the reservoir shall be drawn off in whole or in part, and what alterations, additions, and repairs are necessary to be made to the dam or reservoir to make the dam or reservoir safe, and shall forthwith in writing under his or her hand notify the owner or person having control of the dam or reservoir to cause the additions, alterations, and repairs in the dam or reservoir to be made within a time to be limited in the notice; and may order the water in the reservoir to be drawn off, in whole or in part, as the director may determine.

Nothing contained herein shall be construed to relieve any other person from any liability which he or she would otherwise have, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to authorize or permit any recovery in excess of the injury or damage actually incurred.

       A law enforcement officer having probable cause to believe that a person has committed an offense under this chapter shall offer the person the opportunity to submit to a chemical test. It is not necessary for the law enforcement officer to offer a chemical test to an unconscious person. A law enforcement officer may offer a person more than one chemical test under this chapter. However, all tests must be administered within three (3) hours after the officer had probable cause to believe the person violated this chapter. A person must submit to each chemical test offered by a law enforcement officer in order to comply with the implied consent provisions of this chapter.

The state maintains title in fee to all soil within its boundaries that lies below the high water mark, and it holds that land in trust for the use of the public.

         Since its establishment in 1971, the CRMC has had the authority to manage and plan for the preservation of the coastal resources of the state including, but not limited to, submerged lands. The legislature hereby declares that, in light of the unique size, scope, and overall potential impact upon the environment of large scale filling projects involving twenty-five (25) acres or more, any lease of tidal lands, or any license to use those lands, is subject to approval, disapproval, or conditional approval by the direct enactment of the general assembly by legislative action. The CRMC shall review all requests for leases, licenses to use the land, and other authority to use the land made by any applicant prior to presentation of the request to the general assembly, and the CRMC shall make recommendations on the request to the general assembly. With the exception of any and all projects to fill land of twenty-five (25) acres or more, the general assembly hereby recognizes and declares that the CRMC is delegated the sole and exclusive authority for the leasing of submerged and filled lands and giving licenses for the use of that land. Accordingly, the CRMC will develop, coordinate, and adopt a system for the leasing of submerged and filled lands, and licenses for the use of that land, and will ensure that all leases and licenses are consistent with the public trust. Pursuant thereto, the CRMC shall impose a maximum fee of eighty thousand dollars ($80,000) per annum for any transatlantic cable that makes landfall in Rhode Island. All such fees collected shall be deposited into the Bays, Rivers and Watersheds Fund, established pursuant to § 46-31-12.1, and shall be disbursed according to the purposes of that fund. Nothing contained in this subsection negates, repeals, or alters the provisions, processes, and requirements for the leasing of submerged land for the conduct of aquaculture as set out under chapter 10 of title 20. Therefore, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit or impair the authority of the state, or any duly established agency of the state, to regulate filling or dredging affecting tidal lands owned by the state or any other entity, and nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit or impair the obligation of the applicant to obtain all applicable regulatory approvals. Specifically, and without limiting the foregoing, nothing in this subsection negates, repeals, or alters the provisions, processes, and requirements for water quality certification contained in chapter 12 of this title.

        Since the state had already granted the plaintiff the right to use certain coastal resources through nineteenth-century legislation confirmed by the Confirmation of Legislative Conveyances Generally Act, the Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC) could only grant an assent to the plaintiff to work on its tide-flowed property rather than use coastal resources held in trust by the state, and the fact that the plaintiff was required to seek a permit from CRMC was of no consequence because CRMC had only the power to oversee and direct the method by which the plaintiff could fill in the tide waters to the harbor line, and once the plaintiff filled-in and improved that land below the mean high-water mark, it established title thereto, free and clear of the public trust claim asserted by the state.
       </p>

        With its explicit reference to “tidal water below the mean high water mark, ” the Coastal Resources Management Council enabling statute absolutely and clearly authorizes the agency to regulate the lands to which the state holds title under the public-trust doctrine.

      Any person who violates, or refuses or fails to obey, any notice or order issued pursuant to § 46-23-7(a); or any assent, order, or decision of the council, may be assessed an administrative penalty by the chairperson or executive director in accordance with the following:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t46c23s46-23-7.1ol11">
       The chairperson or executive director is authorized to assess an administrative penalty of not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for each violation of this section, and is authorized to assess additional penalties of not more than one thousand ($1,000) for each day during which this violation continues after receipt of a cease-and-desist order from the council pursuant to § 46-23-7(a), but in no event shall the penalties in aggregate exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000). Prior to the assessment of a penalty under this subdivision, the property owner or person committing the violation shall be notified by certified mail or personal service that a penalty is being assessed. The notice shall include a reference to the section of the law, rule, regulation, assent, order, or permit condition violated; a concise statement of the facts alleged to constitute the violation; a statement of the amount of the administrative penalty assessed; and a statement of the party’s right to an administrative hearing.

This request shall specify in detail the statements contested by the party. The executive director shall designate a person to act as hearing officer. If no hearing is requested, then after the expiration of the twenty-one (21) day period, the council shall issue a final order assessing the penalty specified in the notice. The penalty is due when the final order is issued. If the party shall request a hearing, any additional daily penalty shall not commence to accrue until the council issues a final order.

     <p>
      Coastal and estuarine habitat such as coastal wetlands, anadromous fish runs, and eelgrass beds are threatened, damaged, or have been destroyed by historic pollution, oil spills, incompatible development, and other factors. The coastal and estuarine habitats of Rhode Island’s waters provide great benefits to the citizens of this state including, but not limited to, protection from coastal storms and erosion. Coastal and estuarine habitat resources also serve as nurseries and breeding grounds for important recreational and commercial finfish and shellfish populations, capture and filter run-off pollution, and significantly contribute to the state’s economic, community and ecological health. Restoration of tidally restricted coastal wetlands can also ensure protection of human health and safety by controlling populations of certain salt marsh mosquitoes known to carry the Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus. The state’s economy is directly dependent on the health and productivity of Rhode Island’s coastal waters, including Narragansett Bay and the coastal ponds. Destruction of coastal and estuarine habitats has been identified as one of the leading causes of decline in economically important fish, shellfish, and other natural resources. Restoring degraded coastal and estuarine habitats is essential for reversing declines in fishery resources and protecting human health and safety. Since healthy and diverse coastal and estuarine habitats are better able to support fish and wildlife resources that have been impacted, and are likely to be impacted in the future, by pollution events such as oil spills, an investment by the state of Rhode Island to provide restoration planning and technical expertise and to implement measures to restore coastal and estuary habitats is vital to the economic prosperity and quality of life of the citizens of the state.

      <p>
       “The general assembly hereby finds and declares that:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(1) The production, transport, and use of fossil fuels have significant impacts on the environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2) The impacts of climate change upon Rhode Island's built and natural environments are wide-ranging, discernible, and documented, and, in many cases growing in severity and include sea level rise, coastal erosion, increased precipitation, flooding, and storm surge.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(3) As of 2016, the range in sea level rise change is projected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to be a maximum of approximately one foot (1´) in 2035, two feet (2´) in 2050, and up to nine feet (9´) by 2100.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(4) Annual precipitation has increased by two inches (2") since 1950 and more intense rainfall is flooding low-lying areas and threatening public infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(5) Climate change has and will continue to pose significant risks for state and municipal infrastructure and our environment, public health, welfare, and economic well-being.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(6) Providing areas for coastal and estuarine habitats to migrate is essential to preserving coastal and marine wildlife resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(7) Ecosystem services that natural environments provide, such as dampening of wave energy and flood storage, are at risk due to climate change, and protecting natural systems is vital to protecting built infrastructure and is cost effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(8) Rhode Island infrastructure is at risk and the state must begin to plan and implement projects to adapt to changing conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(9) Reducing the vulnerability of our infrastructure is vital to the economic prosperity and quality of life of the citizens of the state.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(10) The state, cities, and towns need a dedicated, long-term source of funding to assist in implementing projects to address the impacts of climate change.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(11) The purpose of this chapter is to create the Ocean State Climate Adaptation and Resilience (OSCAR) fund as a dedicated long-term source of grant funds to enable cities and towns to implement projects that restore and improve the climate resilience of vulnerable coastal habitats, as well as river and stream floodplains with priority to projects that improve community resilience and public safety.”

     <p>
      It is hereby found and declared that:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t46c25s46-25-2ol11">
       There exists in the Providence metropolitan area and Narragansett Bay severe water quality problems resulting from the discharge of pollutants, conventional, and unconventional, into Narragansett Bay.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c25s46-25-2ol12">
       It is further found and declared that Narragansett Bay may be the greatest natural resource of the state of Rhode Island, and continuing discharge of these pollutants jeopardizes the environmental integrity of the entire Narragansett Bay and creates severe and detrimental ecological and economic impact upon the people of the state of Rhode Island.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c25s46-25-2ol13">
       It is further found and declared that because of the scope and complexity of the work necessary to correct and minimize these pollution discharges and the scope of financing required, local municipal governments in the Providence metropolitan area have been unable alone to cope properly and immediately with the magnitude of the pollution discharges.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c25s46-25-2ol14">
       It is further found and declared that economy and efficiency dictate the desirability for an overall plan for dealing with pollution discharges in the Narragansett Bay and the Providence metropolitan area.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c25s46-25-2ol15">
       It is further found and declared that the most effective and efficient method to combat the discharge of pollutants in the Narragansett Bay is to create a Narragansett Bay water quality management district commission, to be charged with the acquisition, planning, construction, financing, extension, improvement, and operation and maintenance of publicly owned sewage treatment facilities in the Narragansett Bay water quality management district, with appropriate provision for a portion of the financing of the activities to be undertaken by the pledging of the full faith and credit of the state of Rhode Island.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c25s46-25-2ol16">
       Title 46, chapter 21 created the Blackstone Valley district commission and charged it with the planning, construction, operation, and maintenance of facilities to deal with the sewage and industrial wastes which originate in municipalities and industries located in the Blackstone and Moshassuck Valleys and are discharged into the waters of the state including the Seekonk and Blackstone rivers which flow into the Narragansett Bay without proper treatment.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c25s46-25-2ol17">
       Economy, efficiency and technological advances dictate the desirability of having one entity to formulate, coordinate, and regulate an overall plan to reduce the discharge of sewerage and industrial wastes originating from the Blackstone and Moshassuck Valleys into the waters of this state and the discharge of pollutants into Narragansett Bay from the Narragansett Bay water quality management district.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c25s46-25-2ol18">
       The most effective and efficient method of effectuating such an overall plan is to merge the Blackstone Valley district commission with and into the Narragansett Bay water quality management district commission.
      </li>
      <li id="t46c25s46-25-2ol19">
       The most effective and efficient method of effectuating an overall plan for dealing with discharges in the watershed of the Narragansett Bay is the merger, consolidation, acquisition, operation and management of other sewage treatment facilities located in the state with or by the Narragansett Bay water quality management district commission as the commission may from time to time determine.
