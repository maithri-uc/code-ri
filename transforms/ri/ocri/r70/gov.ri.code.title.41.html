     <p>
      Within the department of business regulation there shall be a division of gaming and athletics licensing. The division shall supervise the enforcement of all laws relating to the regulation and control of racing and athletics, and may in the first instance make decisions and issue orders, subject to appeal to the racing and athletics hearing board. The division shall exercise all powers and duties prescribed by chapters 3, 3.1, 4, 5, 7, and 11 of this title, and all other acts relative to the regulation and supervision of horse racing, dog racing, and athletics, heretofore performed by the commission on horse racing and athletics. The division shall comply with § 42-14-14 in the conduct of any investigation related to any license application, permit and/or registration related to chapters 3, 3.1, 4, 7, and 11 of this title. The division may comply with § 42-14-14 in the conduct of any investigation related to any license application, permit and/or registration related to chapters 5 and 5.2 of this title. The investigation shall require the applicant to apply to the bureau of criminal identification of the Rhode Island state police or the Rhode Island department of the attorney general for a nationwide criminal records check with fingerprinting. The applicant shall be responsible for payment of the costs of the criminal records check. The Rhode Island state police or the Rhode Island department of the attorney general, as applicable, shall send the results of the criminal records check to the division. Once the results are sent to and received by the Rhode Island lottery, the Rhode Island state police and the Rhode Island department of attorney general shall promptly destroy the fingerprint record(s). On or before February 1, 2011, the agency shall adopt rules and regulations establishing criteria to be used in determining whether, based upon a criminal records check, an application will be approved.

        A plaintiff filing a declaratory judgment suit seeking a declaration that the issue of simulcasting should be placed on a city’s public referendum before the division could license simulcasting in that city pursuant to § 41-11-2 did not have to exhaust his administrative remedies by appealing to the division’s hearing board since the plaintiff ’s suit raised a pure question of law and there was no factual record that the hearing board could develop to aid the court in its decision.

        Where rule 593 of the race commission authorized a racetrack to preserve order when a meeting was not in progress and imposed the duty on the racetrack police force to perform this function when a meeting was in progress, this did not mean that the racetrack was not liable for acts of the police force constituting false arrest and assault and battery on a patron, since with § 41-3-17, a duty is imposed on the racetrack to protect its patrons.

The referee shall have power in his or her discretion to declare forfeited any prize, remuneration, or purse or any part thereof belonging to any contestants if, in his or her judgment, the contestant or contestants are not or were not competing in good faith. The physician in attendance shall examine the referee prior to each bout or event and certify whether he or she is capable of performing his or her duties based upon the examination. In all championship bouts held in Rhode Island, first consideration shall be given to referees in good standing residing in Rhode Island.

       All bouts will be evaluated and scored by three (3) judges.
      </li>
      <li id="t41c5.2s41-5.2-18ol1b">
       The ten-point (10) must system will be the standard system of scoring a bout. Under the ten-point (10) must scoring system, ten points (10) must be awarded to the winner of the round and nine (9) points or less must be awarded to the loser, except for a rare even round, which is scored (10-10).

       Judges shall evaluate mixed martial arts techniques, such as effective striking, effective grappling, control of the fighting area, effective aggressiveness and defense.
      </li>
      <li id="t41c5.2s41-5.2-18ol1d">
       Evaluations shall be made in the order in which the techniques appear in subsection (c), giving the most weight in scoring to effective striking, effective grappling, control of the fighting area, and effective aggressiveness and defense.
      </li>
      <li id="t41c5.2s41-5.2-18ol1e">
       Effective striking is judged by determining the total number of legal heavy strikes landed by a contestant.
      </li>
      <li id="t41c5.2s41-5.2-18ol1f">
       Effective grappling is judged by considering the amount of successful executions of a legal takedown or reversals. Examples of factors to consider are takedowns from standing position to mount position, passing the guard to mount position, and bottom position fighters using an active, threatening guard.
      </li>
      <li id="t41c5.2s41-5.2-18ol1g">
       Fighting area control is judged by determining who is dictating the pace, location, and position of the fight. Examples of factors to consider are countering a grappler’s attempt at takedown by remaining standing and legally striking; taking down an opponent to force a ground fight; creating threatening submission attempts and passing the guard to achieve mount; and creating striking opportunities.
      </li>
      <li id="t41c5.2s41-5.2-18ol1h">
       Effective aggressiveness means moving forward and landing a legal strike.
      </li>
      <li id="t41c5.2s41-5.2-18ol1i">
       Effective defense means avoiding being struck, taken down, or reversed while countering with offensive attacks.
      </li>
      <li id="t41c5.2s41-5.2-18ol1j">
       The following objective scoring criteria shall be utilized by the judges when scoring a round:
       <ol>
        <li id="t41c5.2s41-5.2-18ol1j1">
         A round is to be scored as a 10-10 round when both contestants appear to be fighting evenly and neither contestant shows clear dominance in a round;
        </li>
        <li id="t41c5.2s41-5.2-18ol1j2">
         A round is to be scored as a 10-9 round when a contestant wins by a close margin, landing the greater number of effective legal strikes, grappling, and other maneuvers;
        </li>
        <li id="t41c5.2s41-5.2-18ol1j3">
         A round is to be scored as a 10-8 round when a contestant overwhelmingly dominates by striking or grappling in a round;
        </li>
        <li id="t41c5.2s41-5.2-18ol1j4">
         A round is to be scored as a 10-7 round when a contestant totally dominates by striking or grappling in the round.

      </li>
      <li id="t41c5.2s41-5.2-18ol1k">
       Judges shall use a sliding scale and recognize the length of time the fighters are either standing or on the ground, as follows:
