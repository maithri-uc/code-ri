       Whereas it is recognized that freshwater wetlands, buffers, floodplains, and other areas that may be subject to storm flows and flooding as defined in this chapter provide storage and absorption areas for flood waters which reduce flood hazards; and
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas all flood plains for all rivers, streams, and other water courses are certain to be overflowed with water periodically in spite of all reasonable efforts to prevent those occurrences; and
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas flood waters overflowing into freshwater wetlands, buffers, floodplains, and other areas that may be subject to storm flows and flooding are not only released more slowly downstream, thus reducing the damage they may cause, but flood waters may be absorbed into the ground water supply further reducing the flood hazard and recharging the vital ground water resource; and
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas precipitation patterns are known to be changing and Rhode Island has experienced a higher frequency of intense storm events resulting in flooding; and
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas freshwater wetlands and buffers are among the most valuable of all wildlife habitats and are high-value recreational areas as well, and wildlife and recreation are widely recognized as essential to the health, welfare, and general well-being of the general populace; and
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas it has been established through scientific study that activities conducted in lands adjacent to freshwater wetlands can exert influence on their condition, functions, and values and subsequently these lands should be protected; and
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas it has been established through scientific study that maintaining lands adjacent to freshwater wetlands as naturally vegetated buffers protects the functions and values of wetlands and that such buffers in and of themselves perform vital ecological functions; and
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas it has been established through scientific study that freshwater wetlands and buffers maintained in a natural condition can provide benefits to water quality through the filtering and uptake of water pollutants, retention of sediment, stabilizing shorelines, and other natural processes; and
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas freshwater wetlands, buffers, and floodplains, are increasingly threatened by random and frequently undesirable projects for drainage, excavation, filling, encroachment, or other forms of disturbance or destruction, and that a review of scientific literature indicates that aspects of existing state standards to protect these areas need to be strengthened; and
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas the protection of freshwater wetlands, buffers, floodplains, and other areas that may be subject to storm flows and flooding from random, unnecessary, and/or undesirable drainage, excavation, filling, encroachment, or any other form of disturbance or destruction is recognized as being in the best public interest and essential to the health, welfare, and general well-being of the general populace and essential to the protection of property and life during times of flood or other disaster affecting water levels or water supply;
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas the lack of uniform standards results in duplication of reviews administered by state and local governments and burdens businesses and property owners who require a predictable regulatory environment to be successful; and
      </p>
      <p>
       Whereas it is recognized that statewide regulatory standards to protect freshwater wetlands, buffers, and floodplains are in the public interest, important to supporting economic vitality, and necessary to ensure protection is achieved in a consistent manner; and
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, the provisions of the following sections are intended to preserve freshwater wetlands, buffers, and floodplains and regulate the use thereof through the establishment of jurisdictional areas and the regulation of activities consistent with this chapter.

        Application for approval of a project to the director of environmental management shall be made in a form to be prescribed by the director and provided by the director upon request. Prior to the application, a request may be made for preliminary determination as to whether this chapter applies. A preliminary determination shall be made by the director only after an on-site review of the project and the determination shall be made within thirty (30) days of the request. This chapter shall be determined to apply if a significant alteration appears to be contemplated and an application to alter a freshwater wetland, buffer, or floodplain will be required. Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of the completed application accompanied by plans and drawings of the proposed project, the plans and drawings to be prepared by the registered professional engineer to a scale of not less than one inch (1") to one hundred feet (100'), the director shall notify all landowners whose properties are within two hundred feet (200') of the proposed project and the director will also notify the city or town council, the conservation commission, the planning board, the zoning board, and any other individuals and agencies in any city or town within the borders of which the project lies that may have reason, in the opinion of the director, to be concerned with the proposal. The director may also establish a mailing list of all interested persons and agencies who or that may wish to be notified of all applications.

        If the director receives any objection to the project within forty-five (45) days of the mailing of the notice of application from his or her office, the objection to be in writing and of a substantive nature, the director shall then schedule a public hearing in an appropriate place as convenient as reasonably possible to the site of the proposed project. The director shall inform by registered mail all objectors of the date, time, place, and subject of the hearing to be held. The director shall further publish notice of the time, place, date, and subject of the hearing in one local newspaper circulated in the area of the project and one statewide newspaper, the notices to appear once per week for at least two (2) consecutive weeks prior to the week during which the hearing is scheduled. The director shall establish a reasonable fee to cover the costs of the investigations, notifications and publications, and hearing and the applicant shall be liable for the fee.

        In the event of a decision in favor of granting an application, the director shall issue a permit for the applicant to proceed with the project and shall require the applicant to pay a permit fee of one hundred dollars ($100). The permit may be issued upon any terms and conditions, including time for completion, that the director may require. Permits shall be valid for a period of one year from the date of issue and shall expire at the end of that time unless renewed. A permit may be renewed for up to three (3) additional one-year periods upon application by the original permit holder or a subsequent transferee of the property subject to permit, unless the original permit holder or transferee has failed to abide by the terms and conditions of the original permit or any prior renewal. The director may require new hearings if, in his or her judgment, the original intent of the permit is altered or extended by the renewal application or if the applicant has failed to abide by the terms of the original permit in any way. In addition, in the event a project authorized by a permit was not implemented by the permit holder or transferee because approval of the project by a federal agency, for which application had been timely made, had not been received or a federal agency had stopped the project from proceeding, prior to the expiration of the permit, the permit holder or transferee may apply for a renewal of the permit at any time prior to the tenth (10th) anniversary of the original issuance, and the application shall be deemed to be an insignificant alteration subject to expedited treatment. The request for renewal of a permit shall be made according to any procedures and form that the director may require.

The application shall include a description of the proposed construction and the date upon which construction is scheduled to begin, which date shall be no earlier than thirty (30) calendar days after the date of the filing of the application. The division of agriculture shall review such applications to determine that they are submitted for agricultural purposes and to ensure that adverse effects to the flow and circulation patterns and chemical and biological characteristics of freshwater wetlands are minimized and that any adverse effects on the aquatic environment are minimized and will not result in a significant alteration to the freshwater wetlands. Pursuant to this review, the division shall notify the applicant, in writing, whether the proposal is an insignificant alteration. This notice shall be issued not later than thirty (30) days after the date that the application was filed with the division. In the event notice is given by the division as required, the application shall be conclusively presumed to be an insignificant alteration. If no notice is given as required, or if an application is approved as an insignificant alteration, the applicant may cause construction to be done in accordance with the application, and neither the applicant, nor the applicant’s agents or employees who cause or perform the construction in accordance with the application, shall be liable for any criminal, civil, administrative or other fine, fee, or penalty, including restoration costs for violations alleged to arise from the construction.

In making such a determination, the division of agriculture shall consider the proposed activity on a case-by-case basis, relative to the characteristics of the particular jurisdictional area in which the activity is proposed, and shall consider whether the activity incorporates best farm management practices and ensures that adverse effects to the flow and circulation patterns and chemical and biological characteristics of freshwater wetlands, buffers, and floodplains are minimized and that any adverse effects on the aquatic environment are minimized in each instance.

       In the event of a violation of § 2-1-21, the director of environmental management has the power to order complete restoration of the freshwater wetland, buffer, floodplain, or other jurisdictional area involved by the person or agent responsible for the violation. If the responsible person or agent does not complete the restoration within a reasonable time following the order of the director of the department of environmental management, the director has the authority to order the work done by an agent of the director’s choosing and the person or agent responsible for the original violation is liable for the cost of the restoration. The violator is liable for a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000) for each violation, except that if the violator knowingly or recklessly alters a freshwater wetland, buffer, floodplain or other jurisdictional area without a permit or approval from the director; knowingly or recklessly alters a freshwater wetland, buffer, floodplain or other jurisdictional area in violation of the rules or regulations promulgated by the director; or alters a freshwater wetland, buffer, floodplain or other jurisdictional area in violation of a permit issued by the director, then the violator is liable for a fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for each violation.

        Whenever any person, firm, industry, company, corporation, city, town, municipal or state agency, fire, district, club, or other individual or group commences any activity set forth in § 2-1-21 without first having obtained the approval of the director, or violates any rule or regulation of the director, the director has the power by written notice to order the violator to cease and desist immediately and/or restore the freshwater wetlands, buffers, floodplains, or other jurisdictional areas to their original state insofar as possible. Any order or notice to restore freshwater wetlands, buffers, floodplains, or other jurisdictional areas is eligible for recordation under chapter 13 of title 34 and shall be recorded in the land evidence records in the city or town where the property subject to the notice is located and any subsequent transferee of the property is responsible for complying with the requirements of the order or notice. If the violator and/or subsequent transferee is ordered to restore the freshwater wetlands, buffer, floodplain, or other jurisdictional area to the original state, and the violator and/or subsequent transferee does not complete the restoration within a reasonable time following the order of the director, the director has the authority to order the work done by an agent of the director’s choosing, and the person, agent, or subsequent transferee is liable for the cost of the restoration. If the violator and/or subsequent transferee does not conform to the director’s order, the director may bring prosecution by complaint and warrant and the prosecution shall be made in the district court of the state. The director, without being required to enter into any recognizance or to give surety for cost, may institute the proceedings in the name of the state. It is the duty of the attorney general to conduct the prosecution of all proceedings brought by the director.

      Upon the acceptance of each plan by the secretary of agriculture and his or her approval of each plan, the department is authorized and empowered to accept and receive all grants of money made pursuant to the soil conservation and domestic allotment act, for the purpose of enabling the state to carry out the provisions of that plan. All those moneys, together with any moneys which may be appropriated by the state, shall be paid into a special fund in the state treasury to be known as the agricultural soil conservation program fund. That fund is established, and is available to the department for expenditures necessary in carrying out the plan, including administration expenses, expenditures in connection with educational programs and research programs in aid of the plan, and for benefit payments.

     <p>
      The local chief shall be elected, appointed, or designated by the procedure established and within the framework spelled out in the fire company or fire district, city or town charter, by-laws, constitution, or any other existing format for appointment of a fire chief. The fire chief’s term of office is recognized as that which is spelled out in the fire company or fire district, city or town charter, by-laws, constitution, or any other existing format for such term of appointment. The fire chief elected, appointed, or designated shall forthwith notify the director of the department of environmental management of the election, appointment, or designation and shall further notify the director of his or her specific forest fire district and jurisdiction. The director may then enter into agreements with each fire chief and fire company to provide assistance and to accept assistance in the prevention and control of forest fires and enforcement of forest fire laws that may include training of personnel. It is the responsibility of the city or town council to appoint a qualified resident to forest fire chief and to designate a forest fire company for any portion of the city or town not protected by an existing fire chief and fire company. If the city or town council of any city or town shall fail to appoint a fire chief as required by this section, the director of the department of environmental management shall appoint some qualified resident of the city or town to act as fire chief until an appointment shall be made by the city or town council as provided in this section. In any fire company or fire district, the fire chief shall establish and define his or her forest fire district and jurisdiction and shall designate a qualified resident of each district to serve as authorized senior officer. Any designated senior officer shall serve at the pleasure of the fire chief by whom he or she was designated. A fire chief shall notify the director of the department of environmental management of each authorized senior officer designated by him or her, and of each removal from designation by him or her, forthwith upon the designation or removal.

     <p>
      Whenever, in the opinion of the tree warden, it is necessary to remove or prune any tree or shrub under his or her control, he or she may cause the tree or shrub to be removed or pruned at the expense of the town or city, and the town council or city council shall order paid to the person performing the work any reasonable compensation that may be determined and approved, in writing, by the tree warden. Unless the condition of the tree constitutes an immediate public hazard, he or she shall, at least five (5) days before the removal, post in the immediate vicinity a suitable notice stating his or her intention to remove the tree. If any person, firm or corporation objects to the removal, he or she or it may appeal to the tree warden, in writing, who shall hold a public hearing at some suitable time and place after giving reasonable notice of the hearing to all persons known to be interested and posting a suitable notice in the immediate vicinity. Within three (3) days after the hearing, the tree warden shall render his or her decision granting or denying the appeal. The department of transportation, the department of environmental management, and the park commission of any town or city have the right to remove or prune any tree or shrub at their own expense, but prior to the removal of any tree shall post a suitable notice in the immediate vicinity of the tree and, if requested, hold a public hearing and either grant or deny the appeal.

      Before any person, firm or corporation cuts or saws, as provided in this chapter, he or she shall at least five (5) days prior to the cutting or sawing notify the department of environmental management, on forms prepared by the department, of the location of the area and/or property. The five (5) day notice contained in this section may be reduced to any length of time, including a complete waiver of the five (5) day notice by the department, if in the discretion of the department the reduction is warranted. Failure to give the required notice is considered sufficient cause to suspend a registration certificate for a period not exceeding thirty (30) days. No suspension becomes effective unless the person, firm or corporation which is alleged to have failed to give the required notice has been notified of the alleged failure and has also had an opportunity to be heard. Any person, firm, or corporation, or any authorized agent of any person, firm or corporation shall utilize best management practices while harvesting trees as provided for in this chapter. Administrative fees for the filing of five (5) day notices shall be collected as provided for in § 2-10-3.1 and deposited within the state forestry fund as provided for in § 2-10-3.

      The Interstate Compact on pest control is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions in form substantially as follows:

      <p>
       Findings
      </p>
      <p>
       The party states find that:
      </p>
      <ol type="a">
       <li id="t02c16.1s2-16.1-2aIol1a">
        In the absence of the higher degree of cooperation among them possible under this compact, the annual loss of approximately one hundred thirty-seven billion dollars ($137,000,000,000) from the depredations of pests is virtually certain to continue, if not to increase.
       </li>
       <li id="t02c16.1s2-16.1-2aIol1b">
        Because of varying climatic, geographic and economic factors, each state may be affected differently by particular species of pests; but all states share the inability to protect themselves fully against those pests which present serious dangers to them.
       </li>
       <li id="t02c16.1s2-16.1-2aIol1c">
        The migratory character of pest infestations makes it necessary for states both adjacent to and distant from one another to complement each other’s activities when faced with conditions of infestation and reinfestation.
       </li>
       <li id="t02c16.1s2-16.1-2aIol1d">
        While every state is seriously affected by a substantial number of pests, and every state is susceptible of infestation by many species of pests not now causing damage to its crop and plant life and products, the fact that relatively few species of pests present equal danger to or are of interest to all states makes the establishment and operation of an insurance fund, from which individual states may obtain financial support for pest control programs of benefit to them in other states and to which they may contribute in accordance with their relative interests, the most equitable means of financing cooperative pest eradication and control programs.

       If, in the opinion of the director of environmental management or his or her appointed agents, it becomes necessary to destroy five (5) leaved pines or species of the genus ribes not actually infected with the disease, the owner may receive compensation for any species of the genus ribes it becomes necessary to destroy, if he or she makes demand within twenty-four (24) hours after notification from the department of the intention to destroy the species. In case any owner makes demand for compensation for the property it becomes necessary to destroy, application shall be made to the director to appoint some qualified disinterested person to appraise the value of the species of the genus ribes that it becomes necessary to destroy, and the destruction of the property shall be deferred pending the appraisal of the value of the property. The appraiser shall, upon appraising the value of property that it becomes necessary to destroy, certify the facts of the appraisal to the department of environmental management and the amount of the appraised value of the property shall be paid to the owner of the property, and the destruction of the property shall proceed.

       The Asian longhorned beetle, Anoplophora glabripennis, a native insect pest of China, is known to be a serious insect pest to several tree species within the United States, including, but not limited to, maples, willows, poplars, birch, London Plane, and elms. The emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis, also a native insect pest from Asia, is also known to be a serious insect pest to several types of ash trees within the United States, including, but not limited to, green ash, white ash, and black ash. All of the at-risk trees are part of the natural environment of Rhode Island and occur on many of the state’s public and private lands, contributing to their value and health. Additionally these insects pose substantive risk to the Rhode Island nursery and landscape industry plant materials and market opportunities. Accordingly, the Asian longhorned beetle and emerald ash borer are hereby declared to be public nuisances, and their suppression is authorized and required. No owner or occupant of an estate infested with either or both nuisances is by reason of that infestation liable to an action, civil or criminal, except to the extent and in the manner and form set forth in §§ 2-17-22 — 2-17-24.

      The chief entomologist and the director of environmental management, or either of them, may personally or through his or her deputies inspect any orchard, garden, field or roadside in public or private grounds which he or she knows, or has reason to suspect, is infested with any seriously injurious insect pests or plant diseases when, in his or her judgment, the presence of those pests or plant diseases are a nuisance to adjoining owners and shall give any instructions and directions that may be necessary in order that the nuisance may be abated. If the owner or person in charge of the trees or other plants constituting the nuisance fails within a reasonable time to follow the directions of the chief entomologist and the director of environmental management, and abate the nuisance, the chief entomologist and the director of environmental management may cause the necessary work to be done and the cost of that work shall be charged to that owner or person in charge of the trees or other plants, and the actual cost of the work shall be recovered in an action of the case to be brought by the general treasurer and the money received paid into the treasury of the state to be added to the regular annual appropriation of the department of environmental management.

       It is the duty of the director to inspect at least once each year during the growing season, all nurseries in the state of Rhode Island to ascertain whether they are infested with injurious insect pests or infected with injurious plant diseases. If upon the inspection of any nursery it appears that the nursery and the nursery stock are apparently free from injurious insects and plant diseases, it is the duty of the director to issue to the owner of the nursery, or the person in charge of the nursery, a certificate setting forth the fact of the inspection and freedom from injurious insects and plant diseases. Conversely, if inspection of any nursery and the stock reveals the presence of injurious insects and/or plant diseases, the owner or person in charge of the nursery shall take any measures to suppress or eradicate these injurious insects and/or plant diseases that the director prescribes, and a certificate shall not be issued until the director, by subsequent inspections, determines that the nursery and stock are apparently free from injurious insects and plant diseases.

        Property owner was bound by an injunction that enjoined him from using his farmland for weddings for a fee or other commercial events because hosting weddings for a fee was an activity that fell outside the statutory definition of “agricultural operations”; thus, hosting weddings for a fee was a “nonagricultural” activity that was subject to the town’s control.

       STATEMENT OF PURPOSE, FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 1.
       Statement of purpose, findings and declaration of policy.
       The purpose of this compact is to recognize by constitutional prerequisite the interstate character of the northeast dairy industry and to form an interstate commission for the northeast region. The mission of the commission is to take such steps as are necessary to assure the continued viability of dairy farming in the northeast, and to assure consumers of an adequate, local supply of pure and wholesome milk.
      </p>
      <p>
       In today’s regional dairy marketplace, cooperative, rather than individual state action may address more effectively the market disarray. Under our constitutional system, properly authorized, states acting cooperatively may exercise more power to regulate, interstate commerce than they may assert individually without such authority. For this reason, the participating states invoke their authority to act in common agreement, with the consent of Congress, under the compact clause of the Constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
       In establishing their constitutional regulatory authority over the region’s fluid milk market by this compact, the participating states declare their purpose that this compact neither displace the federal order system nor encourage the merging of federal orders. Specific provisions of the compact itself set forth this basic principle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Designed as a flexible mechanism able to adjust to changes in a regulated marketplace, the compact also contains a contingency provision should the federal order system be discontinued. In that event, the interstate commission is authorized to regulate the marketplace in replacement of the order system. This contingent authority does not anticipate such a change, however, and should not be so construed. It is only provided should developments in the market other than establishment of this compact result in discontinuance of the order system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recent, dramatic price fluctuations, with a pronounced downward trend, threaten the viability and stability of the northeast dairy region. Historically, individual state regulatory action has been an effective emergency remedy available to farmers confronting a distressed market. The federal order system, implemented by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 [
       <cite class="ocri">
        7 U.S.C.
       </cite>
       § 601 et seq.], establishes only minimum prices for dairy products, without preempting the power of states to regulate milk prices above the minimum levels so established. Based on this authority, each state in the region has individually attempted to implement at least one regulatory program in response to the current dairy industry crisis.
      </p>
      <p>
       The participating states find and declare that the dairy industry is the paramount agricultural activity of the northeast. Dairy farms, and associated suppliers, marketers, processors and retailers, are an integral component of the region’s economy. Their ability to provide a stable, local supply of pure, wholesome milk is a matter of great importance to the health and welfare of the region.
      </p>
      <p>
       The participating states further find that dairy farms are essential to the region’s rural communities and character. The farms preserve open spaces, sculpt the landscape and provide the land base for a diversity of recreational pursuits. In defining the rural character of our communities and landscape, dairy farms also provide a major draw for our tourist industries.
      </p>
      <p>
       By entering into this compact, the participating states affirm that their ability to regulate the price which northeast dairy farmers receive for their product is essential to the public interest. Assurance of a fair and equitable price for dairy farmers ensures their ability to provide milk to the market and the vitality of the northeast dairy industry, with all the associated benefits.

       The cannabis sativa plant used for the production of hemp is separate and distinct from forms of cannabis used to produce marijuana.
      </li>
      <li id="t02c26s2-26-2ol12">
       Hemp is used for products such as building materials, cloth, cordage, fiber, food, floor coverings, fuel, industrial chemicals, paint, paper, particle board, plastics, seed meal, seed oil, and yarn.
      </li>
      <li id="t02c26s2-26-2ol13">
       Industrial hemp production has remained legal throughout most of the world and hemp has the capacity to grow in a multitude of different climates, altitudes, soils, and weather conditions.
      </li>
      <li id="t02c26s2-26-2ol14">
       Currently, it is legal to import industrial hemp into the United States.
      </li>
      <li id="t02c26s2-26-2ol15">
       Although federal law currently prohibits the cultivation of hemp, the laws of California, Colorado, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia permit commercial hemp programs.
      </li>
      <li id="t02c26s2-26-2ol16">
       Currently, the United States is the largest importer of hemp products, the largest portion of which is imported from China.

      <li id="t02c26s2-26-2ol17">
       States are not required to enforce federal law or prosecute people for engaging in activities prohibited by federal law. Therefore, compliance with this chapter does not put the state of Rhode Island in violation of federal law.

     </h3>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t02c27s2-27-1ol1a">
       The general assembly recognizes that forest land in the state has many important values, including, but not limited to: clean air, clean water, economic importance, climate change mitigation, habitat, and supporting human health and well-being. Forest land should be maintained to meet Rhode Island’s aggressive climate change goals through carbon sequestration and storage. Core forest land and connecting natural areas should be conserved to prevent ongoing fragmentation of the state’s forests. Moreover, forest conservation is necessary to protect and maintain water quality and important wildlife habitat. It is in the best interest of the people that the state identify and acquire the development rights to core and unfragmented forests so as to maintain these important forest values for future generations. Moreover, the state must develop incentives to encourage private forest land owners to maintain forests and to enhance urban and community forestry ecosystems that provide collective benefits to people and wildlife, including filtering air and water, controlling storm water, conserving energy, and a myriad of additional critical benefits.
      </li>
      <li id="t02c27s2-27-1ol1b">
       The general assembly finds that forest land is being converted to other uses because its current development value far exceeds its economic value to individual private landowners as forest; that forest land is an important part of the state’s economy, environment, and quality of life; and that forests provide important economic opportunities for many people living in the rural portions of the state. Whereas most of the development value of forests accrue to the private landowner, many of the economic benefits of retaining forests are also public benefits, some of which are not often quantified. All of this serves to undervalue forests without proper mechanisms and tools to account for public services and cost savings provided by private forests.
      </li>
      <li id="t02c27s2-27-1ol1c">
       Therefore, the general assembly establishes a forest conservation commission to be coordinated and staffed by the department of environmental management to implement the following objectives:
       <ol>
        <li id="t02c27s2-27-1ol1c1">
         Assess and recommend new funding sources to conserve forest land across the forest continuum of rural to urban landscapes;
        </li>
        <li id="t02c27s2-27-1ol1c2">
         Identify incentives to encourage forest landowners to maintain and manage their land and preserve forest values;
        </li>
        <li id="t02c27s2-27-1ol1c3">
         Encourage forest conservation as a means to sequester carbon and mitigate climate change and maintain the numerous other benefits provided by forests;
        </li>
        <li id="t02c27s2-27-1ol1c4">
         Help to increase and create new markets for Rhode Island forest products to store carbon long-term and create new jobs;
        </li>
        <li id="t02c27s2-27-1ol1c5">
         Assess impediments to the expansion of the Rhode Island forest products industry and recommend changes to remove impediments;
        </li>
        <li id="t02c27s2-27-1ol1c6">
         Assess means to encourage the improvement and expansion of urban and community forestry; and
