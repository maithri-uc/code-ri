        These principles are applicable to interim as well as final dispositions of children coming under the jurisdiction of the family court and they serve as adequate guidelines to govern the pre-hearing-detention determination. Morris v. D'Amario,
        <cite class="ocri">
         416 A.2d 137
        </cite>
        ,

        </cite>
        (R.I. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The state through its power and obligation as parens patriae has both a rational and compelling interest in interference in family autonomy when these basic rights of children are violated or threatened. In re Lester,
        <cite class="ocri">
         417 A.2d 877

        The state’s role in protecting children may properly be preventive of harm as well as remedial. In re Lester,

       <p>
        Under R.I. Gen. Laws § 14-1-2, the purpose of the family court was to strike a balance between the child’s welfare, the best interests of the State, and when possible, the conservation and strengthening of family ties; the fact that a trial justice iterated this function in a dependency and neglect proceeding was not evidence of bias in favor of the Department of Children, Youth and Families or against a father.

        A child has a fundamental interest in the security of his person, physical well-being, and access to a minimal supply of the basic necessities of life. In re Lester,

        Where no exceptional circumstances existed which would have required a natural parent to provide post-secondary education for petitioner, the family court had no authority to require the Department for Children and Their Families to do so as parens patriae. In re Debra,

        Trial justice did not abuse her discretion in not allowing the father to admit the allegations of dependency. The reason for the father’s incarceration was his decision to engage in criminal activity; while prior to his incarceration, he made admirable efforts to provide for his family, he was aware of the mother’s history of alcoholism, and when her relapse occurred, only nine weeks after his initial detention, the father was not in a position to care for the child.

        Dependency is by definition a condition involving harm or potential harm to a child that arises without fault by the parent, and if the parent’s inability to provide the child with a minimum degree of care or proper supervision is a result of the parent’s incarceration, it can hardly be argued that the parent is without fault.

        Legally competent evidence supported the trial justice’s findings of neglect; when the child was placed in the temporary custody of the department, the father was unable to provide for the child because of his incarceration, and when the case was tried and a decision rendered, the father had made no arrangements for the child’s well-being and was unable himself to care for the child because of his incarceration.

        Pursuant to R.I. Const. art. I, § 7, dismissal of the separate cases brought against the defendants, in the Superior Court and in the District Court, respectively, would not be proper despite the fact that those courts did not have jurisdiction over the defendants because they were only 17-years-old at the time they committed the alleged offenses. Rather, the proper thing to do would be to transfer those cases to the court having exclusive original jurisdiction, which was the Family Court pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 14-1-5. State v.

        In order to protect the best interests of the child, the decision of a placement agency to remove a child from the home of the prospective adoptive parents must be subject to judicial review, and the family court is the proper forum for such review. In re Joseph,

        Although the prospective adoptive parents may not have been entitled to the permanent custody of a child prior to filing an adoption petition, the removal of the child from their care, which would have effectively foreclosed the possibility of adoption for them, constituted an injury in fact and having been thus injured, they had standing to contest that action in the family court.

        The policy of lenity applies to the construction of criminal statutes and requires that a court adopt the less harsh of two possible meanings when faced with an ambiguous criminal statute. The waiver statutes of R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 14-1-7 and 14-1-7.1 are civil in nature and deal solely with waiver of a family court’s jurisdiction over a child, not with the criminality of the conduct in question; thus, the rule of lenity therefore does not apply to the construction of §§ 14-1-7 and 14-1-7.1.

        There is nothing in the statutory scheme of R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 14-1-7 and 14-1-7.1 that restricts the Attorney General from bringing charges against a child in a superior court which are different than those that served as the basis for waiver from a family court, provided the new charges arise from the same nucleus of operative facts. Thus, when the Attorney General’s motion to waive a family court’s jurisdiction with charges of breaking and entering, second-degree robbery, kidnapping, and assault with intent to commit robbery and kidnapping based on a minor defendant’s breaking into a residential treatment facility and kidnapping an employee, a grand jury could indict defendant for burglary, first-degree robbery, felony assault, kidnapping, and larceny of goods valued at greater than $500 based on the same incident, and the indictment was not subject to dismissal for lack of jurisdiction under R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(2). State v. Day,

        The double-jeopardy clause did not bar the state from prosecuting a juvenile defendant in the superior court following his participation in a waiver-of-jurisdiction hearing in the family court, since the double-jeopardy clause applies only to proceedings that are “essentially criminal”, subjecting the defendant to the possibility of punitive incarceration.

        The policy of lenity applies to the construction of criminal statutes and requires that a court adopt the less harsh of two possible meanings when faced with an ambiguous criminal statute. The waiver statutes of R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 14-1-7 and 14-1-7.1 are civil in nature and deal solely with waiver of a family court’s jurisdiction over a child, not with the criminality of the conduct in question; thus, the rule of lenity therefore does not apply to the construction of §§ 14-1-7 and 14-1-7.1.

        The Superior Court and District Court could not acquire exclusive original jurisdiction over defendants charged with criminal offenses committed when they were 17-years-old despite an amendment to R.I. Gen. Laws § 14-1-6 purporting to grant jurisdiction. Pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 14-1-40(a), juveniles could not be charged except in accord with “this chapter,” and R.I. Gen. Laws § 14-1-6 was completely silent with respect to how the Family Court could waive jurisdiction over a child; waiver could only occur pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 14-1-7 and § 14-1-7.1. State v.

      Except in case of emergency detention, whenever any appropriate person shall give to the court information in his or her possession that a child is within the provisions of this chapter, it shall be the duty of the court to make a preliminary investigation to determine whether the interests of the public or of the child require that further action be taken, and to report its findings together with a statement of the facts to the judge. The inquiry may include a preliminary investigation of the home and environmental situation of the child, his or her previous history, and the circumstances which were the subject of the information. To avoid duplication of effort and to take full advantage of all existing facilities, the report of any public agency, or of any private social agency licensed by the department of children, youth, and families, may be accepted by the court as sufficient evidence for the filing of a petition.

If not so released, the child shall be placed in the custody of a probation counselor or other person designated by the court, or shall immediately be taken to the court or other place of detention designated by the court, and the officer taking him or her shall immediately notify the court and shall file a petition when directed to do so by the court.

        Juveniles facing prehearing detention need not be afforded a probable-cause hearing.

        This section is compatible with constitutional free-press guarantees because the press enjoys no greater right of access to juvenile proceedings than does the general public. Excluding the press from the category of those “with a direct interest” in these proceedings is, therefore, clearly permissible. Edward A. Sherman Publishing Co. v. Goldberg,

      In the hearing of any case in which a child is alleged to be delinquent or wayward, if a person refuses to answer a question or produce other evidence of any kind on the ground that he or she may be incriminated by it, or if a child refuses to answer a question or produce other evidence of any kind on the ground that it supports a finding that he or she is delinquent or wayward, and if the attorney general, in writing, requests the chief judge of the family court or his or her designee to order that person or child to answer the question or produce the evidence, the court, in its discretion, after notice to the witness, may order the person or child to answer the question or produce the evidence. In deciding those matters, the chief judge or his or her designee shall consider whether the person may be incriminated, or whether the evidence may support a finding that the child is delinquent or wayward, in some other jurisdiction. After complying, and if, but for this section, he or she would have been privileged to withhold the answer given or the evidence produced by him or her, that person or child shall not be prosecuted or subjected to penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which, in accordance with the order, he gave answer or produced evidence. But he or she may, nevertheless, be prosecuted or subjected to penalty or forfeiture for any perjury, false swearing, or contempt committed in answering or failing to answer, or in producing, or failing to produce, evidence in accordance with the order.

       Power of court to order disposition of child.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If the court finds that a child is delinquent, wayward, neglected, dependent, or otherwise within the provisions of this chapter, it may by order duly entered proceed as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t14c01s14-1-32ol11">
       The court may place the child on probation or under supervision in his or her own home or in the custody of a relative or other suitable person, or in the custody of the director of children, youth and families, upon any terms the court determines. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the placement of a child in any facility licensed or approved by another department of state government, upon any terms that the court shall determine; provided, that if the court finds that a child is delinquent or wayward for any offense which has resulted in damage to the property of another, then the court may order that appropriate monetary restitution be made immediately to the owner of the damaged property by the child, his or her parent, parents, or guardian or other lawful custodian, upon examination and after a finding that the child, or his or her parent, parents, or guardian or other lawful custodian, has the ability to pay restitution.
      </li>
      <li id="t14c01s14-1-32ol12">
       The court may order the child to engage in community restitution at a state or municipal agency or department in addition to or in lieu of restitution, for a period of time to be determined by the court.
      </li>
      <li id="t14c01s14-1-32ol13">
       The court may order the parent or parents of the child to undertake a program of counseling, which program shall be designed to attempt to remedy those conditions which led to the child’s coming before the court.
      </li>
      <li id="t14c01s14-1-32ol14">
       The court may, by order duly entered, prior to a finding that a child is delinquent, wayward, neglected, dependent, or otherwise within the provisions of this chapter, place the petition on file. The court may, in its discretion, attach conditions to the petition. The conditions shall be a valid court order. If no action is taken on the petition for a period of one year or less, if so ordered, following the filing, the authorization issuing the petition shall be revoked by the clerk and the petition shall be closed.
      </li>
      <li id="t14c01s14-1-32ol15">
       The court may, after a hearing on either a stenographic or tape recorded record, and after also considering any need of the juvenile and/or the juvenile’s family for the juvenile to have a driver’s license, the relative benefits of the juvenile retaining or losing driving privileges, and whether any circumstances in the school environment or educational services are adversely affecting the juvenile’s school attendance deny, revoke, suspend and/or reinstate a juvenile’s driving privileges including both the learning license and/or driver’s license of any juvenile deemed wayward as a result of the family court finding the child truant pursuant to chapter 19 of title 16 and/or wayward/delinquent.

        In cases of children abandoned or neglected by their parents, the family court stands in loco parentis charged by the legislature with the responsibility of placing children who come within its protection in the custody of a person or agency qualified to provide them with the care and consideration they should have received from their parents.

        Municipal probate courts lack the jurisdiction to decide petitions for guardianship opposed by a parent, which petitions may not be decided without the participation of the family court, as that court alone has the express statutory power to divest a parent of custody and/or parental rights, along with the expertise and resources essential to exercise such power.

       If a judge of the family court finds that a child is delinquent, wayward, or otherwise within the provisions of this chapter, and places the child on probation, he or she shall, where appropriate, require the child to compensate the victim for losses due to the act of the child, and the child shall make restitution in a reasonable amount within a reasonable period of time and in accordance with that payment schedule established by the judge from funds earned by the child pursuant to employment engaged in by the child. The restitution shall be made under the direction of a probation counselor in cooperation with the administrator of the juvenile victim restitution program within the family court.

      The family court shall be responsible for the administration of the restitution program, shall oversee and coordinate all local community based juvenile restitution programs, and shall process and make all payments to children who are required to perform community restitution in lieu of other public or private employment pursuant to § 14-1-32.1. The probation counselor responsible for a child offender, or a child restitution office in the local city or town, shall maintain time sheets and other documents necessary to determine and process the payment of child offenders. Remuneration for the services provided by the child offender in a community restitution job shall be made as a wage payment by check, with the child offender listed as the payee. However, the check shall be mailed to the child’s probation counselor or a child restitution office established by the cities and towns. The child offender shall pay the victim of his or her acts seventy-five percent (75%) of each payment and twenty-five percent (25%) of the payment shall be retained by the child. This same percentage shall apply to the child offender who is otherwise employed at the time he or she is required to make restitution.

      In the event that the court shall award a dependent or neglected child to the custody of the department of children, youth, and families, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, the child shall, unless otherwise ordered, become a ward and be subject to the guardianship of the department. That guardianship shall not include the guardianship of any estate of the child. The department shall be made party to any proceeding for the legal adoption of the child and may, by its attorney or agent, appear in the family court where those proceedings are pending and consent to the adoption. However, when adoption proceedings shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the family court, then notice of the filing of the petition in the adoption proceedings shall be filed with the clerk of the family court at least twenty (20) days before any final decree of adoption shall be entered, and the entry of any final decree of adoption shall release the department from any liability which may have been incurred by it by reason of the commitment of the child to it.

When neither the religious faith of the parents nor the religious faith of the child is ascertainable, the foregoing principles shall not apply.

      <li id="t14c01s14-1-42ol1b">
       A parent, guardian, or next friend of a child or counsel for a child who has been committed or assigned by the court to the custody of the department of children, youth and families may at any time file with the court a verified petition, stating that the person or the department has denied an application for the release of the child or has failed to act upon the application within a reasonable time. If the court is of the opinion that an investigation should be had, it may, upon due notice to all concerned, proceed to hear and determine the question at issue. If a petition is filed, it shall be the duty of the court to determine by clear and convincing evidence that there has been a change of circumstances, and where the modification or revocation of the order of commitment is in the best interest of the child and the public, the court may:
       <ol>
        <li id="t14c01s14-1-42ol1b1">
         Order that the child be restored to the custody of its parent or guardian or be detained in the custody of the person or the department;

       In any case where a child has been certified and adjudicated pursuant to §§ 14-1-7.2 and 14-1-7.3, and sentenced pursuant to § 14-1-7.3(a)(2), the court shall schedule a review of the child’s case thirty (30) days prior to the child’s eighteenth birthday or thirty (30) days prior to the one-year anniversary of the imposition of the sentence, whichever is greater. It shall be the responsibility of the attorney general or of the law enforcement agency making the arrest to notify the victim or victims of the crime for which the juvenile was certified and adjudicated of the pendency of the hearing and afford them the opportunity to be heard. The court shall not hear or determine any other motion for modification of the order of certification, except as provided for in this section. At that time and upon proof by clear and convincing evidence that demonstrates that the person has made sufficient efforts at rehabilitation and that the modification of the order of certification would not pose a threat to the safety of the public, the court may suspend, but shall not vacate, the balance of the sentence.

       <ol>
        <li id="t14c01s14-1-42ol1d1">
         That the person be remanded to the training school for youth until further hearing to be held no later than one year thereafter in accordance with subsection (c) of this section; or

         In any case where a child has been certified and adjudicated pursuant to § 14-1-7.3(a)(2), upon motion by the attorney general and/or the department of children, youth and families, the court shall conduct a hearing to consider modification of the order of certification if the family court determines that the individual poses a serious threat to the safety of the public, other residents at the training school and/or training school staff. Upon that finding the court may order that the jurisdiction of the sentence be transferred to the department of corrections and that the balance of the sentence be served in facilities under the control of the department.

      In the hearing of any case in which an adult is charged with an offense committed against state laws within the purview of this chapter, if a person refuses to answer a question or produce other evidence of any kind on the ground that he or she may be incriminated by it, or if a child refuses to answer a question or produce other evidence of any kind on the ground that it supports a finding that he or she is delinquent or wayward, and if the attorney general, in writing, requests the chief judge of the family court or his or her designee to order that person or child to answer the question or produce the evidence, the court, in its discretion, after notice to the witness, may order the person or child to answer the question or produce the evidence. In deciding those matters, the chief judge or his or her designee shall consider whether the person may be incriminated or whether the evidence may support a finding that the child is delinquent or wayward in some other jurisdiction. After complying, and if, but for this section, he or she would have been privileged to withhold the answer given or the evidence produced by him or her, that person or child shall not be prosecuted or subjected to penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which, in accordance with the order, he or she gave answer or produced evidence. But he or she may, nevertheless, be prosecuted or subjected to penalty or forfeiture for any perjury, false swearing, or contempt committed in answering or failing to answer, or in producing, or failing to produce, evidence in accordance with the order.

        Where a child’s foster parents bring an action in the family court seeking injunctive relief to prevent the department of children and their families from reuniting the child with his natural mother until there can be a hearing on their petition for adoption and the court determines that the foster parents lack standing and denies them relief, and the foster parents file an appeal, the Supreme Court will depart from its usual procedure and consider the appeal as a petition for certiorari in order to address the merits of the case, as the action of the court below has an element of finality.

        Although the way to obtain review of an order granting a preliminary injunction entered in the superior court was by appeal within 20 days following entry, where third-party defendants in a divorce action filed a petition for certiorari to obtain such a review, the petition would be read as if it were a claim of appeal since it was claimed within the 20-day time limit.

        Although this statute does not explicitly state that a denial of a contempt motion falls within the purview of the required procedure under this provision, the words “relating to” modify the words “finding of contempt,” irrespective of whether a finding of contempt was actually made, and thus review may be sought only by a petition for certiorari.

        Father’s pro se, direct appeal filed in the state supreme court of the family court’s order denying the father’s motion to modify a child support order had to be denied and the family court’s order had to be affirmed; the proper procedure for reviewing questions involving the modification of child support were not reviewable by direct appeal, but instead required that a party file, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 14-1-52(b), a petition for writ of certiorari in the state supreme court and the father’s case did not present the rare circumstance where the failure to file the R.I. Gen.

        Wife’s appeal of the trial court’s denial of her motion for attorney’s fees in her contempt action against her husband was improper because, under R.I. Gen.

        Pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 14-1-52(b), a petition for certiorari was the only proper vehicle for bringing the father’s claims where although he was never adjudged in contempt, the father’s appeals clearly resulted from the mother’s filing for contempt.14-1-52 DeCesare v. Delfarno,

        Even though a father’s motion was styled as a motion for credit for the Social Security Disability Insurance benefits received by the mother, it was in fact a motion to modify the amount of child support he was obligated to pay where the father was aware that the mother was receiving those benefits at the time the parties agreed on child support. Since matters related to the modification of child support are not appealable and the father had not filed a petition for a writ of certiorari as required by R.I. Gen. Laws § 14-1-52(b), the appeal was not properly before the court. Evans v. Evans,

        The legislature’s clear intent when enacting this statute was to ensure that the decision to place a child in department of children and their families’ (DCF) care outside the state be made only after a careful and comprehensive examination of the circumstances of the individual case. To allow DCF to place children outside the state, even in a foster home, with no judicial oversight would violate both the spirit and the letter of this statute. In re Peter G.,

      Upon written motion by the victim of a crime or his or her attorney, the family court may, in its discretion, and upon good cause shown, divulge the name and address of the juvenile accused of committing the crime solely for the purpose of allowing the victim to commence a civil action against the juvenile and/or his or her parents to recover for damages sustained as a result of the crime; provided, that written notice of the motion shall be given to the juvenile accused of committing the crime or his or her attorney, and further provided that the court shall order that the name and address of the juvenile accused of committing the crime not be divulged by the victim of a crime or his or her attorney to any other person unless and until the civil action is commenced, without further order of the court.

        The legislature intended and contemplated by this section that an act for which a juvenile is adjudged delinquent should be considered a crime in the context of a civil action brought by the victim of the crime; such acts likewise retain their criminal character under the Criminal Royalties Act (Chapter 25.1 of Title 12), which is also a civil remedy for victims of crime.

        This section eliminated the requirement that the declarant must have been “laboring under the stress of nervous excitement” when the statement was made; to ensure reliability, the lawmakers instead required that the hearsay statement must have been made to someone the child would normally turn to for sympathy, protection, or advice.

        In a proceeding for termination of parental rights, any error in admission of the testimony of a sexual-abuse therapist as to statements of a child that her father had physically abused both her and her sister did not prejudice the parents since they were absolved of sexual abuse, and there was ample independent, competent evidence to prove that the children had suffered physical abuse.

        Where a child stated that she told her mother about the assaults by her mother’s boyfriend and also reported that her mother responded with indifference and instructed her not to disclose his wrongdoing to the department of children and their families, in light of the facts presented, the passing of four days between the date of the assault and its disclosure represents a reasonable interval.

        Because of the significant lapse of time between the taking of the children into custody and the allegations of abuse, the ample opportunity for reflection and deliberation given the children, and numerous previous disclosures about abuse against others, the allegations of abuse against the parents may not have been made spontaneously or at the children’s fist safe opportunity to disclose the abuse, and thus the spontaneity and timeliness requirements of this section were not met.

        In a termination of parental rights action, the trial court erred in admitting the hearsay testimony of the child’s foster mother, in which the child indicated that the mother had hit the child, as the statement was made three months after the child began living with the foster mother; however, reversal was not required because the trial justice’s decision to terminate the mother’s parental rights was not based upon the abuse allegedly inflicted by the mother, but rather upon the mother’ failure to protect the child from the father’s abuse.

        and she argued that the trial justice committed reversible error because he permitted witnesses to testify about hearsay statements made by the children under R.I. Gen. Laws § 14-1-69 due to the passage of time, it was clear, without question, that the children’s hearsay statements were not necessary for the trial justice to determine that abuse had occurred or that a termination of parental rights was appropriate.

        In a case where the family court found that the father abused and neglected his daughters, the older child’s statements to her former preschool teacher indicating that the younger child had told her that their mother had coached the younger child into making sexual abuse accusations by showing her a pornographic movie did not fit within the hearsay exception provided by this section. The older child’s statements related to the alleged motive underlying the younger child’s disclosures and were properly stricken as inadmissible hearsay; the statements were not statements of abuse made to a trusted adult as they were statements that the younger child’s accusations were fabricated; and, in any event, any purported error was harmless as the rejected testimony was cumulative of admitted testimony.

      In the event a child refuses permission to contact parents to seek parental consent and if, in the judgment of a qualified professional, that contact would not be helpful or would be deleterious to the child who is voluntarily seeking treatment for substance abuse or chemical dependency, then non-invasive, non-custodial treatment services may be provided by a qualified professional without parental consent; provided, during the course of treatment, the qualified professional shall make attempts to obtain permission from the child to obtain parental consent for and parental involvement in the treatment services.

       PURPOSE
      </p>
      <p>
       The compacting states to this interstate compact recognize that each state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of juveniles, delinquents and status offenders who are on probation or parole and who have absconded, escaped or run away from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others. The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act,
       <cite class="ocri">
        4 U.S.C.
       </cite>
       § 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states to: (1) ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status offenders subject to this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority in the sending state; (2) ensure that the public safety interests of the citizens, including the victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving states are adequately protected; (3) return juveniles who have run away, absconded or escaped from supervision or control or have been accused of an offense to the state requesting their return; (4) make contracts for the cooperative institutionalization in public facilities in member states for delinquent youth needing special services; (5) provide for the effective tracking and supervision of juveniles; (6) equitably allocate the costs, benefits and obligations of the compacting states; (7) establish procedures to manage the movement between states of juvenile offenders released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, juvenile departments, or any other criminal or juvenile justice agency which has jurisdiction over juvenile offenders; (8) insure immediate notice to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; (9) establish procedures to resolve pending charges (detainers) against juvenile offenders prior to transfer or release to the community under the terms of this compact; (10) establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by authorized juvenile justice and criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and juvenile and criminal justice administrators; (11) monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; (12) coordinate training and education regarding the regulation of interstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in such activity; and (13) coordinate the implementation and operation of the compact with the interstate compact for the placement of children, the interstate compact for adult offender supervision and other compacts affecting juveniles particularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping supervision issues arise. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the interstate commission created herein are the formation of public policies and therefore are public business. Furthermore, the compacting states shall cooperate and observe their individual and collective duties and responsibilities for the prompt return and acceptance of juveniles subject to the provisions of this compact. The provisions of this compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed to accomplish the purposes and policies of the compact.

     <p>
      The governor on behalf of the state of Rhode Island is authorized to execute a compact, in substantially the following form, with any state, territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the general assembly signifies in advance its approval and ratification of this compact:

       ARTICLE I
      </h3>
      <p>
       Findings and Purposes
      </p>
      <p>
       That juveniles who are not under proper supervision and control, or who have absconded, escaped or run away, are likely to endanger their own health, morals and welfare, and the health morals and welfare of others. The cooperation of the states party to this compact is therefore necessary to provide for the welfare and protection of juveniles and of the public with respect to: (1) cooperative supervision of delinquent juveniles on probation or parole; (2) the return, from one state to another, of delinquent juveniles who have escaped or absconded; (3) the return, from one state to another, of non-delinquent juveniles who have run away from home; and (4) additional measures for the protection of juveniles and of the public, which any two (2) or more of the party states may find desirable to undertake cooperatively. In carrying out the provisions of this compact the party states shall be guided by the non-criminal, reformative and protective polices [policies] which guide their laws concerning delinquent, neglected or dependent juveniles generally. It shall be the policy of the states party to this compact to cooperate and observe their respective responsibilities for the prompt return and acceptance of juveniles and delinquent juveniles who become subject to the provisions of this compact. The provisions of this compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed to accomplish the purposes of Article I of this compact.

        That the parent, guardian, person or agency entitled to legal custody of a juvenile who has not been adjudged delinquent but who has run away without the consent of the parent, guardian, person or agency may petition the appropriate court in the demanding state for the issuance of a requisition for his or her return. The petition shall state the name and age of the juvenile, the name of the petitioner and the basis of entitlement to the juvenile’s custody, the circumstances of his or her running away, his location if known at the time application is made, and any other facts that may tend to show that the juvenile who has run away is endangering his or her own welfare or the welfare of others and is not an emancipated minor. The petition shall be verified by affidavit, shall be executed in duplicate, and shall be accompanied by two (2) certified copies of the document or documents on which the petitioner’s entitlement to the juvenile’s custody is base [based], such as birth certificates, letters of guardianship, or custody decrees. Any further affidavits and other documents that may be deemed proper may be submitted with the petition. The judge of the court to which this application is made may hold a hearing on it to determine whether for the purposes of this compact the petitioner is entitled to the legal custody of the juvenile, whether or not it appears that the juvenile has in fact run away without consent, whether or not he or she is an emancipated minor, and whether or not it is in the best interest of the juvenile to compel his or her return to the state. If the judge determines, either with or without a hearing, that the juvenile should be returned, he or she shall present to the appropriate court or to the executive authority of the state where the juvenile is alleged to be located a written requisition for the return of the juvenile. The requisition shall set forth the name and age of the juvenile, the determination of the court that the juvenile has run away without the consent of a parent, guardian, person or agency entitled to his or her legal custody, and that it is in the best interest and for the protection of the juvenile that he or she be returned. In the event that a proceeding for the adjudication of the juvenile as a delinquent, neglected or dependent juvenile is pending in the court at the time when the juvenile runs away, the court may issue a requisition for the return of the juvenile upon its own motion, regardless of the consent of the parent, guardian, person or agency entitled to legal custody, reciting in it the nature and circumstances of the pending proceeding. The requisition shall in every case be executed in duplicate and shall be signed by the judge. One copy of the requisition shall be filed with the compact administrator of the demanding state, there to remain on file subject to the provisions of law governing records of such court. Upon the receipt of a requisition demanding the return of a juvenile who has run away, the court or the executive authority to whom the requisition is addressed shall issue an order to any peace officer or other appropriate person directing him to take into custody and detain the juvenile. The detention order must substantially recite the facts necessary to the validity of its issuance under this article. No juvenile detained upon the order shall be delivered over to the officer whom the court demanding him or her shall have appointed to receive him or her, unless he or she shall first be taken immediately before a judge of a court in the state, who shall inform him or her of the demand made for his or her return, and who may appoint counsel or guardian ad litem for him or her. If the judge of the court shall find that the requisition is in order, he or she shall deliver the juvenile over to the officer whom the court demanding him or her shall have appointed to receive him or her. The judge, however, may fix a reasonable time to be allowed for the purpose of testing the legality of the proceeding. Upon reasonable information that a person is a juvenile who has run away from another state party to this compact without consent of a parent, guardian, person or agency entitled to his or her legal custody, the juvenile, consistent with section 14-1-26.1, may be taken into custody without a requisition and brought immediately before a judge of the appropriate court who may appoint counsel or guardian ad litem for the juvenile and who shall determine after a hearing whether sufficient cause exists to hold the person, subject to the order of the court, for his or her own protection and welfare, for a time not exceeding ninety (90) days that will enable his or her return to another state party to this compact pursuant to the requisition for his or her return from a court of that state. If, at the time when a state seeks the return of a juvenile who has run away, there is pending in the state in which he or she is found any criminal charge, or any proceeding to have him or her adjudicated a delinquent juvenile for an act committed in that state, or if he or she is suspected of having committed within that state a criminal offense or an act of juvenile delinquency, he or she shall not be returned without the consent of that state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment, detention or supervision for the offense or juvenile delinquency. The duly accredited officers of any state party to this compact, upon the establishment of their authority and the identity of the juvenile being returned, shall be permitted to transport the juvenile through any and all states party to this compact without interference. Upon his or her return to the state from which he or she ran away, the juvenile shall be subject to any further proceedings that may be appropriate under the laws of that state.

        That the appropriate person or authority from whose probation or parole supervision a delinquent juvenile has absconded or from whose institutional custody he or she has escaped shall present to the appropriate court or to the executive authority of the state where the delinquent juvenile is alleged to be located a written requisition for the return of the delinquent juvenile. The requisition shall state the name and age of the delinquent juvenile, the particulars of his or her adjudication as a delinquent juvenile, the circumstances of the breach of the terms of his or her probation or parole or of his or her escape from an institution or agency vested with his or her legal custody or supervision, and the location of the delinquent juvenile, if known, at the time the requisition is made. The requisition shall be verified by affidavit, shall be executed in duplicate, and shall be accompanied by two (2) certified copies of the judgment, formal adjudication, or order of commitment which subjects the delinquent juvenile to probation or parole or to the legal custody of the institution or agency concerned. Any further affidavits and other documents that may be deemed proper may be submitted with the requisition. One copy of the requisition shall be filed with the compact administrator of the demanding state, there to remain on file subject to the provisions of law governing records of the appropriate court. Upon the receipt of a requisition demanding the return of a delinquent juvenile who has absconded or escaped, the court or the executive authority to whom the requisition is addressed shall issue an order to any peace officer or other appropriate person directing him or her to take into custody and detain the delinquent juvenile.

If the judge of the court shall find that the requisition is in order, he or she shall deliver the delinquent juvenile over to the officer whom the appropriate person or authority demanding him or her shall have appointed to receive him or her. The judge, however, may fix a reasonable time to be allowed for the purpose of testing the legality of the proceeding. Upon reasonable information that a person is a delinquent juvenile who has absconded while on probation or parole, or escaped from an institution or agency vested with his or her legal custody or supervision in any state party to this compact, the person may be taken into custody in any other state party to this compact without a requisition. But in that event, he or she must be taken immediately before a judge of the appropriate court, who may appoint counsel or guardian ad litem for the person and who shall determine, after a hearing, whether sufficient cause exists to hold the person subject to the order of the court for a time, not exceeding ninety (90) days, as will enable his or her detention under a detention order issued on a requisition pursuant to this article. If, at the time when a state seeks the return of a delinquent juvenile who has either absconded while on probation or parole or escaped from an institution or agency vested with his or her legal custody or supervision, there is pending in the state in which he or she is detained any criminal charge or any proceeding to have him or her adjudicated a delinquent juvenile for an act committed in the state, or if he or she is suspected of having committed within the state a criminal offense or an act of juvenile delinquency, he or she shall not be returned without the consent of the state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment, detention or supervision for the offense or juvenile delinquency. The duly accredited officers of any state party to this compact, upon the establishment of their authority and the identity of the delinquent juvenile being returned, shall be permitted to transport the delinquent juvenile through any and all states party to this compact, without interference. Upon his or her return to the state from which he or she escaped or absconded, the delinquent juvenile shall be subject to any further proceedings that may be appropriate under the laws of that state.

       That any delinquent juvenile who has absconded while on probation or parole, or escaped from an institution or agency vested with his or her legal custody or supervision in any state party to this compact, and any juvenile who has run away from any state party to this compact, who is taken into custody without a requisition in another state party to this compact under the provisions of article IV(a) or of article V(a), may consent to his or her immediate return to the state from which he or she absconded, escaped or ran away. Consent shall be given by the juvenile or delinquent juvenile and his or her counsel or guardian ad litem if any, by executing or subscribing a writing, in the presence of a judge of the appropriate court, which states that the juvenile or delinquent juvenile and his or her counsel or guardian ad litem, if any, consent to his or her return to the demanding state. Before the consent shall be executed or subscribed, however, the judge, in the presence of counsel or guardian ad litem, if any, shall inform the juvenile or delinquent juvenile of his or her rights under this compact. When the consent has been duly executed, it shall be forwarded to and filed with the compact administrator of the state in which the court is located and the judge shall direct the officer having the juvenile or delinquent juvenile in custody to deliver his [him] or her to the duly accredited officer or officers of the state demanding his or her return, and shall cause to be delivered to that officer or officers a copy of the consent. The court may, however, upon the request of the state to which the juvenile or delinquent juvenile is being returned, order him or her to return unaccompanied to the state and shall provide him or her with a copy of the court order; in that event a copy of the consent shall be forwarded to the compact administrator of the state to which the juvenile or delinquent juvenile is ordered to return.
