       The purpose of the Rhode Island works program is to help parents who are eligible for cash assistance to support their children by preparing for, accepting, and retaining employment. It is the intent of the Rhode Island general assembly that the Rhode Island works program shall provide employment and support services along with temporary cash assistance so that parents can participate in the workforce rather than depend on public assistance to support themselves and their children.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c5.2s40-5.2-2ol1b">
       Under this law, parents are mandated to enter into an employment plan, as a condition of eligibility for cash assistance, and unless they are found to be temporarily exempt from the work requirements, they must participate in intensive employment services at the department of labor and training as the first step in their employment plan. Because it is believed that employment is the most effective anti-poverty measure, all activities and services provided through the Rhode Island works program are designed to promote economic independence through employment and the development of employment skills and to strengthen families through parental responsibility and short-term assistance.

To the extent practicable, work-readiness activities should involve supervised community work experience or unpaid work experiences in the private sector. Intensive work-readiness services include activities that are designed to prepare participants who have limited literacy and work history with the minimum skills necessary to achieve entry-level employment.

      For any month in which a noncustodial parent makes a child support payment in the month when due and the support is collected by the department of human services, for a child or children receiving cash assistance pursuant to this chapter, the first fifty dollars ($50.00) of the child support payment, or the actual amount of the child support payment if the payment is less than fifty dollars ($50.00), shall be paid to the family in which the child resides. If more than one noncustodial parent makes a child support payment to children living in the same family, there shall only be one payment of fifty ($50.00) paid to the family from the child support collected. This payment is known as the “pass through” payment and shall be sent to the family within two (2) business days of the determination that the amount is due and owing and no later than within two (2) business days of the end of the month in which the support was collected.

General public assistance shall not be available to any individual who has been found eligible for supplemental security income (SSI) as provided in § 40-6-27, and the general public medical assistance, as provided for in this chapter, shall not be available to any individual who has been found eligible for medical assistance as provided pursuant to Title XIX of the Social Security Act,

The grant of each recipient shall then be increased by the amount of thirty dollars ($30.00) per week, or a portion thereof proportionate to the number of hours actually worked compared to a standard forty-hour (40) week. The increase shall be considered to result from the recipient’s participation in the program, and shall be included in determining the number of hours to be worked.

     <p>
      The director, in consultation with the director of the division of vocational rehabilitation, shall establish a three-year (3) demonstration work-preparation and supportive work-employment program to place AFDC recipients and people with disabilities in private-sector employment. At least one-third (1/3) of the supportive work-employment program costs shall be covered by payment for services by the participating private employers. The program shall include the use of grant diversion to enable the director to provide all or part of the AFDC or other federal grant to an employer to cover part of the cost of wages paid to the recipient. The program shall also seek all available federal and private funds. The director shall seek federal approval, including waivers of applicable federal regulations as are necessary, to conduct the demonstration program for AFDC recipients and people with disabilities, using grant diversion. The demonstration program shall test the effectiveness of a supported work grant-diversion program in placing AFDC recipients and handicapped persons in long-term employment at wage levels and with advancement potential sufficient to permit economic self-sufficiency and permanent removal from AFDC or other government aid.

      </p>
      <p>
       The policy of the states party to this compact is to make welfare services available among the compacting states on the basis of the mutual removal of barriers caused by restrictive residence requirements of the several states. However, it is recognized that law and policy relating generally to the provision of welfare services by a particular state should not be determined by interstate compact and will remain a matter for determination by that party state and its subdivisions.

      </p>
      <p>
       As used in this compact, the term “welfare service” means and includes public assistance and child welfare services furnished by a party state or a subdivision thereof, provided that such assistance or service is pursuant to a federally-aided plan, arrangement, or program, and any other category of welfare assistance which is federally aided at the time when a claim of eligibility for assistance or service is made pursuant to this compact.

        No person who has removed himself or herself from his or her place of abode in one party state to another party state shall be ineligible for a welfare service in such other party state because of failure to meet that state’s residence requirements for eligibility.

In any such case, the party state to which the person removes himself or herself shall not be obligated to provide the service at its own expense during such ninety (90)-day period. The cost of providing a welfare service to any person made eligible therefor by reason of this compact shall be charged within a state in accordance with the laws of such state.

      The department may consider the granting of a prospective rate that reflects demonstrated cost increases in excess of the rate that has been established by the application of the percentage increase. In order to qualify for the rate increment, demonstrated increased costs must be the result of:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t40c08s40-8-20.1ol11">
       Demonstrated errors made during the rate-determination process;

      <li id="t40c08s40-8-20.1ol12">
       Significant increases in operating costs resulting from the implementation of new or additional programs, services, or staff specifically mandated by the Rhode Island department of health;
      </li>
      <li id="t40c08s40-8-20.1ol13">
       Significant increases in operating costs resulting from capital renovations, expansion, or replacement required for compliance with fire safety codes and/or certification requirements of the Rhode Island department of health, as well as increased energy costs that the facility can demonstrate are a result of the facility having expended funds for heating, lighting, hot water, and similar costs associated with the consumption of energy provided by public utilities;
      </li>
      <li id="t40c08s40-8-20.1ol14">
       Significant increases in workers’ compensation and/or health insurance premiums that cannot be accommodated within the nursing facility’s assigned aggregate per diem rate, if cost justified; provided, that the assigned per diem rate in the labor- and payroll-related-expenses cost center does not exceed two percent (2%) of the cost center ceiling; or

       Extraordinary circumstances, including, but not limited to, acts of God, and inordinate increases in energy costs (e.g., federal BTU tax, regional or national energy crisis). Inordinate increases in energy costs will be immediately reflected in increased rates above the energy cost center ceiling maximum. Provided, however, that the increases will be rescinded immediately upon cessation of the extraordinary circumstance. All requests for rate increments shall be limited to one request per nursing facility for the factors set forth in subsections (2) and (3); provided, additional requests involving a per diem increase in excess of one percent of the nursing facility’s previously assigned aggregate per diem rate shall also be reviewed. Before a nursing facility shall be permitted to file for a rate increment, increases in operating costs set forth in subsections (2) and (3) must have been incurred for a period of not less than three (3) months in order to establish proof of the increase. Rate adjustments granted as a result of a request filed within one hundred twenty (120) days after the costs were first incurred shall be made effective retroactively to the date the costs were actually incurred; provided, further, any adjustments granted as a result of requests filed more than one hundred twenty (120) days after the costs were first incurred will be effective on the first day of the month following the filing of the request.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Effective September 1, 2014, the executive office of health and human services shall require that any payment to an out-of-state provider from whom a Medicaid-eligible individual receives services must be a facility that applies for, and is approved to participate in, the Rhode Island Medicaid program. This excludes payments to out-of-state providers that do not participate in the Rhode Island Medicaid program but that are determined to be acceptable due to extenuating circumstances by the secretary of the executive office of health and human services. Furthermore, the department of children, youth and families is required to submit a bi-weekly report to the chair of the house committee on finance, the chair of the senate committee on finance, the house fiscal advisor, the senate fiscal advisor, and the office of management and budget detailing payments for placements to out-of-state facilities. The report should also indicate the entity recommending or ordering the placement, the types of services required, and reason for using an out-of-state facility. This change may require the adoption of new or amended rules, regulations and procedures.

       Certification as a provider — Revocation or suspension of certification.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Before any provider of medical services receives payment from the Rhode Island Medicaid program, and as a condition of receipt of payment, the provider must have in effect a valid certification of eligibility from the Rhode Island executive office of health and human services. This certification of eligibility will take the form of either a separate provider agreement or language as required by federal regulations imprinted on the medical assistance billing form, which must be signed by the provider. This certification may be revoked or suspended, in accordance with administrative rules to be promulgated by the executive office, if a provider fails to meet professional licensure requirements; violates any administrative regulations of the executive office of health and human services; does not provide proper professional services; is the subject of a suspension of payments order; is convicted of Medicaid fraud; or otherwise violates any provision of this chapter.

     </h3>
     <p>
      It is the intent of the general assembly to continue to meet the goal established in 1993 pursuant to § 42-12.3-2 to ensure access to comprehensive health care by providing or creating access to health insurance to all Rhode Islanders who are uninsured. Over the course of several years, health insurance through the RIte Care program has been extended to pregnant women and children living in families whose income is less than two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the federal poverty level. Many of the parents of these children are uninsured and without the means to purchase health insurance. Federal funds are available to help pay for health insurance for low-income families through the medical assistance program under § 1931 of Title XIX of the Social Security Act,
      <cite class="ocri">
       42 U.S.C.
      </cite>
      § 1396u-1, which de-links medical assistance from cash assistance and allows for expanded income and resource methodologies. It is the intent of the general assembly, therefore, to implement § 1931 of Title XIX of the Social Security Act and, in addition, to provide expanded access to health insurance for eligible families. Federal funds for some children and pregnant women may also be available under Title XXI of the Social Security Act,
      <cite class="ocri">
       42 U.S.C.
      </cite>
      § 1397aa et seq., and it is further the intent of the general assembly to access these funds as appropriate and as authorized in accordance with the legal authority provided by the Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA), and Title XXI of the Social Security Act,

       § 1396o, to establish the RIte Share premium assistance program to subsidize the costs of enrolling Medicaid-eligible persons and families in employer-sponsored health insurance plans that have been approved as meeting certain cost and coverage requirements. The Medicaid agency also obtained, at the general assembly’s direction, federal authority to require any such persons with access to ESI coverage to enroll as a condition of retaining eligibility providing that doing so meets the criteria established in Title XIX for obtaining federal matching funds.

         “Cost-effective” means that the portion of the ESI that the state would subsidize, as well as wrap-around costs, would on average cost less to the state than enrolling that same person/family in a managed-care delivery system.
        </li>
        <li id="t40c8.4s40-8.4-12ol1b2">
         “Cost sharing” means any co-payments, deductibles, or co-insurance associated with ESI.

         “Employee premium” means the monthly premium share a person or family is required to pay to the employer to obtain and maintain ESI coverage.
        </li>
        <li id="t40c8.4s40-8.4-12ol1b4">
         “Employer-sponsored insurance” or “ESI” means health insurance or a group health plan offered to employees by an employer. This includes plans purchased by small employers through the state health insurance marketplace, healthsource, RI (HSRI).
        </li>
        <li id="t40c8.4s40-8.4-12ol1b5">
         “Policy holder” means the person in the household with access to ESI, typically the employee.

         “RIte Share buy-in” means the monthly amount an Medicaid-ineligible policy holder must pay toward RIte Share-approved ESI that covers the Medicaid-eligible children, young adults, or spouses with access to the ESI.

        <li id="t40c8.4s40-8.4-12ol1b8">
         “RIte Share premium assistance program” means the Rhode Island Medicaid premium assistance program in which the State pays the eligible Medicaid member’s share of the cost of enrolling in a RIte Share-approved ESI plan. This allows the state to share the cost of the health insurance coverage with the employer.

         “Third-party liability (TPL)” means other health insurance coverage. This insurance is in addition to Medicaid and is usually provided through an employer. Since Medicaid is always the payer of last resort, the TPL is always the primary coverage.

The office shall obtain and make available to persons otherwise eligible for Medicaid identified in this section as supplemental benefits those benefits not reasonably available under employer-based health insurance plans that are required for Medicaid beneficiaries by state law or federal law or regulation. Once it has been determined by the Medicaid agency that the ESI offered by a particular employer is RIte Share-approved, all Medicaid members with access to that employer’s plan are required to participate in RIte Share.

In designing the pilot program, the director may consider a variety of service-delivery and financing models, including capitation payments to private physicians, a buy-in program under RIte Care, and coverage arrangements purchased from qualified community health centers. In developing the pilot program, the director may seek available federal grant monies, including Medicaid, and private foundation grants.

For purposes of this section, managed care systems may also be defined to include a primary care case-management model, community health teams, and/or other such arrangements that meet standards established by the executive office and serve the purposes of this section. Managed care systems may also include services and supports that optimize the health and independence of beneficiaries who are determined to need Medicaid-funded long-term care under chapter 8.10 of this title or to be at risk for the care under applicable federal state plan or waiver authorities and the rules and regulations promulgated by the executive office. Any Medicaid beneficiaries who have third-party medical coverage or insurance may be provided such services through an entity certified by, or in a contractual arrangement with, the executive office or, as deemed appropriate, exempt from mandatory managed care in accordance with rules and regulations promulgated by the executive office.

The waiver(s), category II or III changes, and/or state-plan amendments shall include the authorization to extend managed care to cover long-term-care services and supports. Authorization shall also include, as deemed appropriate, exempting certain beneficiaries with third-party medical coverage or insurance from mandatory managed care in accordance with rules and regulations promulgated by the executive office.

     <p>
      The purpose of the program of all-inclusive care for the elderly is to offer an alternative to nursing home care for frail elders. The program of all-inclusive care for the elderly is a pre-paid, capitated program of managed care service delivery for beneficiaries who meet special eligibility requirements, including being eligible for nursing home placement, and who elect to enroll. The model of care includes as core services the provision of adult day health care and multidisciplinary team case management, through which access to and allocation of all health services are coordinated.

Attaining systemwide reform of the magnitude set forth herein will require rebalancing the system by making significant changes in the organization, financing, and delivery of services that must be implemented incrementally.

Beginning on July 1, 2007, the total system savings attributable to the value of the reduction in nursing home days including hospice nursing home days paid for by Medicaid shall be allocated in the budget enacted by the general assembly for the ensuing fiscal year for the express purpose of promoting and strengthening community-based alternatives; provided, further, beginning July 1, 2009, said savings shall be allocated within the budgets of the executive office and, as appropriate, the department of human services, office of healthy aging. The allocation shall include, but not be limited to, funds to support an ongoing, statewide community education and outreach program to provide the public with information on home and community services and the establishment of presumptive eligibility criteria for the purposes of accessing home and community care. The home- and community-care service presumptive eligibility criteria shall be developed through rule or regulation on or before September 30, 2007. The allocation may also be used to fund home and community services provided by the office of healthy aging for persons eligible for Medicaid long-term care, and the co-pay program administered pursuant to chapter 66.3 of title 42. Any monies in the allocation that remain unexpended in a fiscal year shall be carried forward to the next fiscal year for the express purpose of strengthening community-based alternatives.

      shall determine the amount of general revenues to be added to the current service estimate of community-based, long-term-care services for elderly sixty-five (65) and older and younger persons at risk of nursing home admissions for the ensuing budget year by multiplying the combined, cost per day of nursing home and hospice nursing home days estimated at the caseload conference for that year by the reduction in nursing home and hospice nursing home days from those in the second fiscal year prior to the current fiscal year to those in the first fiscal year prior to the current fiscal year.

      <li id="t40c8.9s40-8.9-9ol1a">
       Notwithstanding any other provision of state law, the executive office of health and human services is authorized and directed to apply for, and obtain, any necessary waiver(s), waiver amendment(s), and/or state-plan amendments from the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and to promulgate rules necessary to adopt an affirmative plan of program design and implementation that addresses the goal of allocating a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of Medicaid long-term-care funding for persons aged sixty-five (65) and over and adults with disabilities, in addition to services for persons with developmental disabilities, to home- and community-based care; provided, further, the executive office shall report annually as part of its budget submission, the percentage distribution between institutional care and home- and community-based care by population and shall report current and projected waiting lists for long-term-care and home- and community-based care services. The executive office is further authorized and directed to prioritize investments in home- and community-based care and to maintain the integrity and financial viability of all current long-term-care services while pursuing this goal.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c8.9s40-8.9-9ol1b">
       The reformed long-term-care system rebalancing goal is person-centered and encourages individual self-determination, family involvement, interagency collaboration, and individual choice through the provision of highly specialized and individually tailored home-based services. Additionally, individuals with severe behavioral, physical, or developmental disabilities must have the opportunity to live safe and healthful lives through access to a wide range of supportive services in an array of community-based settings, regardless of the complexity of their medical condition, the severity of their disability, or the challenges of their behavior. Delivery of services and supports in less-costly and less-restrictive community settings will enable children, adolescents, and adults to be able to curtail, delay, or avoid lengthy stays in long-term-care institutions, such as behavioral health residential-treatment facilities, long-term-care hospitals, intermediate-care facilities, and/or skilled nursing facilities.

       Pursuant to federal authority procured under § 42-7.2-16, the executive office of health and human services is directed and authorized to adopt a tiered set of criteria to be used to determine eligibility for services. The criteria shall be developed in collaboration with the state’s health and human services departments and, to the extent feasible, any consumer group, advisory board, or other entity designated for these purposes, and shall encompass eligibility determinations for long-term-care services in nursing facilities, hospitals, and intermediate-care facilities for persons with intellectual disabilities, as well as home- and community-based alternatives, and shall provide a common standard of income eligibility for both institutional and home- and community-based care. The executive office is authorized to adopt clinical and/or functional criteria for admission to a nursing facility, hospital, or intermediate-care facility for persons with intellectual disabilities that are more stringent than those employed for access to home- and community-based services. The executive office is also authorized to promulgate rules that define the frequency of re-assessments for services provided for under this section. Levels of care may be applied in accordance with the following:
       <ol>
        <li id="t40c8.9s40-8.9-9ol1c1">
         The executive office shall continue to apply the level-of-care criteria in effect on June 30, 2015, for any recipient determined eligible for and receiving Medicaid-funded long-term services and supports in a nursing facility, hospital, or intermediate-care facility for persons with intellectual disabilities on or before that date, unless:

           The recipient chooses home- and community-based services over the nursing facility, hospital, or intermediate-care facility for persons with intellectual disabilities. For the purposes of this section, a failed community placement, as defined in regulations promulgated by the executive office, shall be considered a condition of clinical eligibility for the highest level of care. The executive office shall confer with the long-term-care ombudsperson with respect to the determination of a failed placement under the ombudsperson’s jurisdiction. Should any Medicaid recipient eligible for a nursing facility, hospital, or intermediate-care facility for persons with intellectual disabilities as of June 30, 2015, receive a determination of a failed community placement, the recipient shall have access to the highest level of care; furthermore, a recipient who has experienced a failed community placement shall be transitioned back into his or her former nursing home, hospital, or intermediate-care facility for persons with intellectual disabilities whenever possible. Additionally, residents shall only be moved from a nursing home, hospital, or intermediate-care facility for persons with intellectual disabilities in a manner consistent with applicable state and federal laws.

       An estimated one hundred and forty-eight thousand (148,000) persons in Rhode Island are providing care at any one time to persons living in the community. The estimated value of their unpaid contributions in 2009 was one billion eight hundred eighty million dollars ($1,880,000,000).

       Family or other caregivers who provide the majority of care in the home are frequently under substantial physical, psychological, and financial stress. The stress, if unrelieved by support for the caregiver, may lead to premature or unnecessary nursing home and institutional placement and health and financial burdens for the caregiver.

      <li id="t40c8.11s40-8.11-1ol1d">
       Respite care and other community-based supportive services for the family caregiver can relieve some of the stresses faced by caregivers; maintain and strengthen the family structure; postpone or prevent institutionalization; and lead to better outcomes for both the caregiver and care recipient.

       The percent of Rhode Islanders age sixty-five (65) years of age and older is projected to grow from fourteen percent (14%) of the state population in 2010 to twenty-one percent (21%) by 2030. As persons age, they have greater dependency needs and an increased need for long-term-care services and support. Younger people with disabilities also require continued supportive long-term-care services as they age.

       As informal caregivers and families are a vital part of the long-term-care services and support system, it is an important public purpose to recognize and respect their contributions; to assess their needs; and to provide them with counseling, education, and support services.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Pursuant to § 42-12.3-2, it is the intent of the general assembly to create access to comprehensive health care for uninsured Rhode Islanders. The Rhode Island Medicaid program has become an important source of insurance coverage for low-income pregnant women, families with children, elders, and persons with disabilities who might not be able otherwise to obtain or afford health care. Under the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010, all Americans will be required to have health insurance, with some exceptions, beginning in 2014. Federal funding is available with ACA implementation to help pay for health insurance for low-income adults, ages nineteen (19) to sixty-four (64), who do not qualify for Medicaid eligibility under Rhode Island general and public laws. It is the intent of the general assembly, therefore, to implement the Medicaid expansion for adults without dependent children authorized by the ACA, to extend health insurance coverage to these Rhode Islanders and further the goal established in § 42-12.3-2 in 1993.

      A managed long-term-care arrangement must require that all participating managed care organizations use only the EOHHS level-of-care tool in determining coverage of long-term-care supports and services for beneficiaries. EOHHS may amend the level-of-care tool provided that any changes are established in consultation with beneficiaries and providers of Medicaid-covered long-term-care supports and services, and are based upon reasonable medical evidence or consensus, in consideration of the specific needs of Rhode Island beneficiaries. Notwithstanding any other provisions herein, however, in the case of a duals demonstration project, a managed care organization may use a different level-of-care tool for determining coverage of services that would otherwise be covered by Medicare, since the criteria established by EOHHS are directed towards Medicaid-covered services; provided, that the level-of-care tool is based on reasonable medical evidence or consensus in consideration of the specific needs of Rhode Island beneficiaries.

        Evidence supported a conclusion that the children were abused and neglected since testimony by social workers, parent aides, and a psychologist established that the mother had borderline intellectual functioning and lacked parental and management skills, that the children lived in squalid conditions, and that both the mother and children had been abused by upstairs tenants.

        State failed to present a prima facie case of child abuse against the mother and the father where the testimony revealed only that the infant was the victim of child abuse, that the injuries were of various ages, that the older injuries were undetectable even to the eyes of trained medical professionals, and that the infant had three caretakers who could have inflicted the infant’s injuries: the mother, the father, and the daycare provider. In addition, the state’s sole witness, an expert in forensic pediatrics, testified that neither petitioners nor the daycare provider could be ruled out as the perpetrators of the abuse.

        S. § 1983 action against state child services officers was properly dismissed on the ground of their qualified immunity because, while deprivation of the right to familial integrity implicated the Fourteenth Amendment, their removal of children from the parents’ home was reasonable; the father was indicted for child molestation and both had intimated suicide. Further, R.I. Gen. Laws § 40-11-2, the statute under which the parents’ son was removed, did not require a finding of abuse; moreover, courts had recognized that an imminent serious risk of neglect justified termination of the parental relationship.

        Legally competent evidence supported the trial justice’s findings of neglect; when the child was placed in the temporary custody of the department, the father was unable to provide for the child because of his incarceration, and when the case was tried and a decision rendered, the father had made no arrangements for the child’s well-being and was unable himself to care for the child because of his incarceration.

        Trial justice committed reversible error when the justice found that a parent abused and neglected the parent’s child, after the child suffered a fractured femur, because the evidence was not sufficient to satisfy the clear and convincing standard of R.I. R. Juv. P. 17(b). The parent testified that the parent was not present at the time of the child’s injury, without evidence to the contrary, and the medical testimony left it unclear whether the child’s injury was inflicted as a result of abuse or was merely accidental in nature.

        Under the clear and convincing standard of R.I. R. Juv. P. 17(b), the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of abuse or neglect as to the mother because it was uncontested that the father’s actions were the sole cause of injury to the child’s lip, there was no evidence in the record supporting the trial justice’s finding that the child’s injuries were not the result of a one-time episode of abuse but sustained over a period of time, and the mother called the pediatrician and took the child to the emergency room after discovering her injuries.

       Any person who has reasonable cause to know or suspect that any child has been abused or neglected as defined in § 40-11-2, or has been a victim of sexual abuse by another child, shall, within twenty-four (24) hours, transfer that information to the department of children, youth and families, or its agent, which shall cause the report to be investigated immediately. As a result of those reports and referrals, protective social services shall be made available to those children in an effort to safeguard and enhance the welfare of those children and to provide a means to prevent further abuse or neglect. The department shall establish and implement a single, statewide, toll-free telephone to operate twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week for the receipt of reports concerning child abuse and neglect, which reports shall be electronically recorded and placed in the central registry established by § 42-72-7. The department shall create a sign, using a format that is clear, simple, and understandable to students, that contains the statewide, toll-free telephone number for posting in all public and private schools in languages predominately spoken in the state, containing pertinent information relating to reporting the suspicion of child abuse, neglect, and sexual abuse. This sign shall be available to the school districts electronically. The electronically recorded records, properly indexed by date and other essential, identifying data, shall be maintained for a minimum of three (3) years; provided, however, any person who has been reported for child abuse and/or neglect, and who has been determined not to have neglected and/or abused a child, shall have his or her record expunged as to that incident three (3) years after that determination. The department shall continuously maintain a management-information database that includes all of the information required to implement this section, including the number of cases reported by hospitals, healthcare centers, emergency rooms, and other appropriate healthcare facilities.

        Since, in the context of a discussion about serious child abuse, the student said that she was hit and bruised, and while she was asked about being hit by her parents, she was crying, those undisputed facts alone rendered the rape crisis center employee’s suspicion that the student was being abused eminently reasonable. In fact, the employee could have been accused of breaking the law had she not reported her suspicions to the department of children and their families within 24 hours, given the content of the student’s speech.

        The “good faith” required by this section that confers immunity is subjective. The “good faith” goes directly to the question of the motivation with which the abuse-reporter acts. Only if an abuse-reporter can prove that he or she had a reasonable suspicion of abuse will he or she be granted immunity from suit. If there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the reporter acted in good faith, the question must be decided at trial by the jury. Wojcik ex rel. Wojcik v. Town of N. Smithfield,

        A simple investigation, without more, causes nothing but a de minimis interference with a family’s integrity, and such interference cannot possibly rise to the level of a constitutional violation. Therefore, a rape crisis center employee’s decision to call the department of children and their families to report suspected child abuse contained not one iota of constitutional misconduct.

       The department shall investigate reports of child abuse and neglect made under this chapter in accordance with the rules the department has promulgated and in order to determine the circumstances surrounding the alleged abuse or neglect and the cause thereof. The investigation shall include personal contact with the child named in the report and any other children in the same household. Any person required to investigate reports of child abuse and/or neglect may question the subjects of those reports with or without the consent of the parent or other person responsible for the child’s welfare. The interviewing of the child or children, if they are of the mental capacity to be interviewed, shall take place in the absence of the person or persons responsible for the alleged neglect or abuse. In the event that any person required to investigate child abuse and/or neglect is denied reasonable access to a child by the parents or other person, and that person required to investigate deems that the best interests of the child so require, they may request the intervention of a local law enforcement agency, or seek an appropriate court order to examine and interview the child. The department shall provide such social services and other services as are necessary to protect the child and preserve the family.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c11s40-11-7ol1b">
       In the event that after investigation it is determined by the department that the child is being or has been abused or neglected but that the circumstances of the child’s family or otherwise do not require the removal of the child for his or her protection, the department may allow the child to remain at home and provide the family and child with access to preventative support and services. In addition, the department is authorized to petition the family court for an order for the provision of treatment of the family and child. Provided, further, the department shall notify the children’s advocacy center of all suspected cases of child sexual abuse.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c11s40-11-7ol1c">
       The department shall have the duty to petition the family court for removal of the child from the care and custody of the parents, or any other person having custody or care of the child, if there is a determination that a child has been abused or neglected; which results in a child death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse or exploitation, or an act or failure to act that represents an imminent risk of serious harm. In addition, in cases of alleged abuse and/or neglect, the department may petition the family court for the removal of the alleged perpetrator of that abuse and/or neglect from the household of the child or children when the child or children are eleven (11) years of age or older. It shall be the responsibility of the department to make the parent or other person responsible for the child’s welfare aware of the court action, the possible consequences of the court action, and to explain the rights of the parent relative to the court action.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c11s40-11-7ol1d">
       The department shall forward immediately any reports of institutional child abuse and neglect to the child advocate who shall investigate the report in accordance with chapter 73 of title 42, and also to any guardian ad litem and/or attorney of record for the child.

      <li id="t40c11s40-11-7ol1e">
       In the event that after investigation the department takes any action regarding placement of the child, the department shall immediately notify the child advocate of such action.

       In the event that after investigation the department has reasonable cause to know or suspect that a child has been subjected to criminal abuse or neglect, the department shall forward immediately any information as it relates to that knowledge or suspicion to the law enforcement agency.

VI right to counsel was violated by the child protective investigator’s jailhouse interview regarding the charge against defendant of child molestation and the trial court’s subsequent admission into evidence of the statement obtained. The questioning of defendant occurred at a critical stage of the prosecution and the investigator was acting as an agent of the State because the investigator was required by R.I. Gen. Laws § 40-11-7(f) to forward any abuse information she obtained to the appropriate law enforcement agency, which the State could then use to prosecute defendant. State v. Oliveira,

        When proposed next friends of foster children sought to bring suit in federal court on behalf of the children, alleging deficiencies in a state’s foster care system violated the children’s federal constitutional and statutory rights, it was error to find that the appointment of guardians ad litem and/or court-appointed special advocates (CASAs) for the children precluded the appointment of next friends, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(c), because Rhode Island law in R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 40-11-7.1(b)(3) and 40-11-14 limited the authority of the guardians ad litem and the CASAs to the family court proceedings in which the guardians ad litem or CASAs were appointed. Sam M. v.

        This section provides only that the government agency must file a motion for a hearing regarding a child’s placement, since the statutory requirement for the agency to request a permanency hearing is triggered by an initial placement of a child into their care. In re Christina V.,

        The 12-month period in the termination of parental rights statute is separate and distinct from that in the abused children statute in that a parent’s refusal to cooperate with mandatory, court-ordered services after an adjudication of neglect or abuse and a parent’s lack of cooperation with the department of children, youth and families before such an adjudication represent significantly different behaviors under the law, with the latter only being a factor that a court takes into consideration in resolving a petition for termination of parental rights, not the principal ground for such termination.

        The trial justice did not err in considering and relying upon a mother’s refusal to accept services before the child’s formal commitment to agency care as an appropriate factor to be weighed in the termination of parental rights calculus where the child’s siblings were already committed to agency care and the agency had offered and was continuing to offer services to the mother in connection with those children.

       <p>
        When proposed next friends of foster children sought to bring suit in federal court on behalf of the children, alleging deficiencies in a state’s foster care system violated the children’s federal constitutional and statutory rights, it was error to find that the appointment of guardians ad litem and/or court-appointed special advocates (CASAs) for the children precluded the appointment of next friends, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(c), because Rhode Island law in R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 40-11-7.1(b)(3) and 40-11-14 limited the authority of the guardians ad litem and the CASAs to the family court proceedings in which the guardians ad litem or CASAs were appointed. Sam M. v.

      Any person seeking to operate a facility, that is, or is required to be, licensed or registered with the department of human services or the department of children, youth and families, shall apply to the Rhode Island bureau of criminal identification, attorney general’s office, or the department of children, youth and families or the state or local police department, for a nationwide criminal records check. The check will conform to the applicable federal standards, including the taking of fingerprints to identify the applicant, and any expense associated with providing the criminal records check shall be paid by the applicant and/or requesting agency. The director of the department of human services or the department of children, youth and families will determine by rule those items of information appearing on a criminal records check that constitute disqualifying information because that information would indicate that the employment could endanger the health or welfare of a child or children. Upon the discovery of any disqualifying information with respect to a proposed operator, the Rhode Island bureau of criminal identification will inform the director of the department of human services or the department of children, youth and families, in writing, of the nature of the disqualifying information.

The department of human services is directed to seek the waiver(s) in order to claim federal financial participation for the services that shall be provided to residents of the state who are deemed to be in need of adult daycare services and/or home-based services and whose incomes are no greater than two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the federal poverty level.

      The general assembly finds:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t40c19s40-19-1ol11">
       In 1988, there were one thousand four hundred sixty-one (1,461) births to adolescents under the age of twenty (20) in the state.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c19s40-19-1ol12">
       Adolescents coping with a pregnancy have a greater risk than the average pregnant woman for:
       <ol type="i">
        <li id="t40c19s40-19-1ol12-i">
         Inadequate nutrition;
        </li>

         Prenatal care starting well into the second trimester;

         Living in poverty households; and finally
        </li>
        <li id="t40c19s40-19-1ol12-iv">
         More likely to drop out of school.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t40c19s40-19-1ol13">
       The literature on adolescents also shows an increase in drug and alcohol use and a rise in depression and suicide.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c19s40-19-1ol14">
       The student dropout rates in the state are as follows:
       <p id="t40c19s40-19-1ol14.1">
        Cranston 23.7% Newport 27% Pawtucket 30.1% Providence 42.4% Warwick 16.4% West Warwick 29.7% Woonsocket 37.1%

       </p>
      </li>
      <li id="t40c19s40-19-1ol15">
       Pregnant and parenting adolescent students face more educational barriers due to student’s high absenteeism, inattentiveness in class, have increased problems of illiteracy and lack the motivation to stay in school during the pregnancy or to return to school after the infant is born.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c19s40-19-1ol16">
       A prime factor in parenting students dropping out of school is the absence of child care, either in the school, community, or home.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c19s40-19-1ol17">
       In the fourteen (14) adolescent pregnancy and parenting programs that currently exist in the state, four (4) of which also have childcare centers, the following is evident:
       <ol type="i">
        <li id="t40c19s40-19-1ol17-i">
         In 1988, thirty-three percent (33%) or four hundred seventy-five (475) out of one thousand four hundred sixty-one (1,461) pregnant adolescents receive community-based services; and
        </li>
        <li id="t40c19s40-19-1ol17-ii">
         In 1988, sixty-seven percent (67%) or nine hundred eighty-six (986) out of one thousand four hundred sixty-one (1,461) pregnant adolescents do not receive any community-based services.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t40c19s40-19-1ol18">
       That of the clients currently enrolled in services in the state the following is established:
       <ol type="i">
        <li id="t40c19s40-19-1ol18-i">
         In some communities the dropout rate for pregnant students has completely reversed from eighty percent (80%) drop out to ninety percent (90%) graduates; and
        </li>
        <li id="t40c19s40-19-1ol18-ii">
         Statewide, programs have demonstrated a thirty-five percent (35%) increase in education from intake into programs; and
        </li>
        <li id="t40c19s40-19-1ol18-iii">
         Students who have child care are more likely to return to school after the pregnancy and remain until graduation; and
        </li>
        <li id="t40c19s40-19-1ol18-iv">
         Adolescent parents equipped with a high school diploma are more likely to be self-sufficient, capable parents able to find and keep employment while caring for their family and less likely to need public assistance on a long-term basis.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t40c19s40-19-1ol19">
       The long-term cost savings are significant as comparisons are made between the cost of providing services to each pregnant and parenting adolescent as one thousand six hundred forty two dollars ($1,642) yearly with an additional cost for daycare services on site in school based programs of three thousand one hundred fifteen dollars ($3,115) yearly as compared to the cost of providing welfare, food stamps, and medical assistance to each client on a yearly basis of eight thousand four hundred dollars ($8,400).
      </li>
      <li id="t40c19s40-19-1ol110">
       The long-term cost savings is significant as adolescent mothers equipped with a high school diploma are more able to find employment, continue career options, and care for themselves and child, therefore becoming less dependent on public assistance (income maintenance) after graduation.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c19s40-19-1ol111">
       Rhode Island must provide the earliest possible support to pregnant adolescents for reasons both of compassion and cost-effectiveness.
