      If the division of taxation decides to execute an order pursuant to § 3-4-1, it may require the payment to it, with the order and the means of paying for the merchandise desired, of a reasonable sum to cover any expenses it may be put to in connection with the transaction taken in connection with other similar transactions. It is a condition precedent to the receiving of the merchandise covered by the order that the party desiring the importation has paid the division of taxation a service charge based upon the manufacturing rates set forth in § 3-10-1 provided, that if the order is placed by a licensee who engages to store the goods ordered, or any part of them, in the warehouse of the department, then the payment of the service charge may be deferred until the goods are withdrawn from the warehouse and in that case the service charge is paid before each lot or parcel is withdrawn.

      The only obligation of the division of taxation, if it decides to execute an order pursuant to § 3-4-1, is to mail the order and the medium of payment for the order in case the division of taxation transmits the means of payment, to inspect the merchandise upon its delivery, and to notify the party ordering the merchandise of its arrival and where it may be found. The leaving with the division of taxation of the order and the making of the payments are taken to be an agreement upon the part of the person desiring the importation to assume all the risks of the transaction, and it is declared that he or she assumes those risks.

        Since § 42-35-14 presupposes that on certain occasions an “agency” will not act prior to normal date of a license and provides for that contingency by extending the life of license until the last date provided by law for seeking review of agency’s post expiration date action, the petitioner’s argument, that the failure of licensing bureau to act on its application for renewal of liquor license prior to expiration of license deprived the bureau of jurisdiction to act thereon at a later date and renewed automatically its license for another year, was untenable even if the licensing authority was an “agency” within the contemplation of subsection (b) of § 42-35-14.

        Franchisor’s motion for a preliminary injunction prohibiting the State from enforcing R.I. Gen. Laws § 3-5-11 was denied where the franchisor was unlikely to succeed on the merits of a free speech claim as R.I. Gen. Laws § 3-5-11(b)(1)(iv) did not prevent it from providing paid marketing and management advice, the freedom of association claim was also likely to fail on the merits as the ban on the franchise sale of liquor did not prevent the franchisor or certain licensees from associating for purposes of exchanging or expressing ideas or for any other purpose except engaging in concerted commercial activity, and the equal protection claim was unlikely to succeed as the franchisor failed to explain why it was arbitrary or irrational to prohibit franchise sales of alcoholic beverages where the stated purposes for the prohibition, (i.e., to promote effective and reasonable controls, protect consumer choices, and ensure equitable pricing) were legitimate and rationally related to those purposes.

        Amendments which the Rhode Island Legislature made to R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 3-5-11 and 3-5-11.1, which nullified existing franchise agreements and prohibited package stores that held Class A liquor licenses from running joint advertisements and using a trade name associated with a chain store, did not violate the First Amendment, the Commerce Clause, or equal protection under the U.S. Constitution. The court of appeals found that the Legislature did not enact the statutes to protect instate businesses, and the hoped-for benefit of regulating and safeguarding against anticompetitive behavior in the retail liquor market outweighed the loss of flexibility that could have been obtained if the law had not placed restraints on franchise agreements and advertising.

Laws §§ 3-5-11 and 3-5-11.1, which nullified existing franchise agreements and prohibited package stores that held Class A liquor licenses from running joint advertisements and using a trade name associated with a chain store, did not violate the First Amendment, the Commerce Clause, or equal protection under the U.S. Constitution. The court of appeals found that the Legislature did not enact the statutes to protect instate businesses, and the hoped-for benefit of regulating and safeguarding against anticompetitive behavior in the retail liquor market outweighed the loss of flexibility that could have been obtained if the law had not placed restraints on franchise agreements and advertising.

        If a local board desires to avail itself of provision of this section permitting it to limit number of licenses it should do so by adopting a rule or regulation and the mere denial of a license on ground that it would exceed number of licenses permitted did not establish such maximum, and therefore administrator on appeal had jurisdiction to order the granting of the license.

        A local licensing board purporting to exercise the power conferred by this section prescribing the maximum number of licenses of any class that it may issue in its community, must do so by adopting some rule or regulation establishing that maximum number but ordinarily the burden is on the local board to establish that it had actually prescribed by rule or regulation such a maximum number of licenses.

        Where there was no town limitation on licenses, by the denial of petitioner’s application for the issuance of a Class A retail liquor license, the board was not thereby attempting to prescribe the maximum number of Class A licenses that could be issued but was denying the application on the basis that petitioner had not shown that the necessity and convenience of the residents of the town warranted the establishment of another retail liquor outlet under a Class A license which was within board’s discretion.

        The facts that, since there were already six Class B licenses within a radius of 2,000 feet, the local board considered an additional license in that area unnecessary and that the applicant for license indicated he proposed to sell his property, raised no question of law and the decision of the administrator who chose to overlook the decision of the local board and grant the license was final.

        Contention that the administrator in directing a Class B victualer retail limited beverage license be granted and issued erred as a matter of law for the reason that the town council had established a maximum of 24 Class B beverage licenses, was without merit since at the time the petitioner’s application was denied, such maximum had not been reached, therefore the administrator’s directive did not cause the limit to be exceeded.

      Before granting a license to any person under the provisions of this chapter and title, the board, body or official to whom application for the license is made, shall give notice by advertisement published once a week for at least two (2) weeks in some newspaper published in the city or town where the applicant proposes to carry on business, or, if there is no newspaper published in a city or town, then in some newspaper having a general circulation in the city or town. Applications for retailer’s Class F, P and Class G licenses need not be advertised. The advertisement shall contain the name of the applicant and a description by street and number or other plain designation of the particular location for which the license is requested. Notice of the application shall also be given, by mail, to all owners of property within two hundred feet (200´) of the place of business seeking the application. The notice shall be given by the board, body or official to whom the application is made, and the cost of the application shall be borne by the applicant. The notices shall state that remonstrants are entitled to be heard before the granting of the license, and shall name the time and place of the hearing. At the time and place a fair opportunity shall be granted the remonstrants to make their objections before acting upon the application; provided that no advertisement or notice need be given pursuant to this section when a license holder applies for a temporary seasonal expansion of an existing liquor license.

       The board, body or official which has issued any license under this title may permit the license to be used at any other place within the limits of the town or city where the license was granted, or, in their discretion, permit the license to be transferred to another person, but in all cases of change of licensed place or of transfer of license, the issuing body shall, before permitting the change or transfer, give notice of the application for the change or transfer in the same manner as is provided in this chapter in the case of original application for the license, and a new bond shall be given upon the issuance of the license provided, that notice by mail need not be made in the case of a transfer of a license without relocation. In all cases of transfer of license, indebtedness of the licensee incurred in the operation of the licensed premises shall be paid to or released by an objecting creditor before the issuing body permits the transfer. In cases of dispute as to the amount of indebtedness, the issuing body, may, in its discretion, permit the transfer upon statement of the licensee, under oath, that the claim of indebtedness is disputed and that the statement of dispute is not interposed for the purpose of inducing transfer of the license. No creditor is allowed to object to the transfer of a license by a receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, assignee for the benefit of creditors, executor, administrator, guardian or by any public officer under judicial process. In case of the death of any licensee, the license becomes part of the personal estate of the deceased. The holders of any retail Class A license within the city or town issuing or transferring a Class A license have standing to be heard before the board, body, or official granting or transferring the license.

        The tax administrator, as a creditor of a defendant (liquor licensee), is barred by the plain language of § 3-5-19 from objecting to the transfer of the liquor license by the receiver pursuant to a court-authorized sale. However, to the extent that §§ 3-5-19 and 3-7-24 impose upon the tax administrator conflicting obligations, § 3-7-24 specifically repealed the inconsistent provisions of all preceding statutes, including § 3-5-19, insofar as such statutes would attempt to prohibit the tax administrator from fulfilling his statutory obligation under § 3-7-24 to ensure that all delinquent state taxes have been paid prior to the transfer of a liquor license. 632 Metacom Assocs. v.

        The Rhode Island tax administrator cannot use § 3-7-24, which requires a certificate of payment of state taxes with every application for renewal or transfer of a license, as a cudgel to club a trustee in bankruptcy into submitting to the monetary demands of the division of taxation as a precondition to transfer of a debtor’s liquor license.

        It was not incumbent on the administrator to find the licensee guilty of permitting gambling on his premises beyond a reasonable doubt, but he would be justified in finding that he had permitted gambling within the licensed premises if there were any legal evidence from which he could find, or reasonably infer, that the licensee had failed in his obligation to maintain an efficient and affirmative supervision of the business to which his license applied.

        There was no valid reason for quashing the liquor control administrator’s decision of suspension in view of the evidence disclosed in the record that a minor was served liquor on the licensed premises, such act constituting such a violation of the statutory provisions justifying administrator’s order of suspension.

       A manufacturer’s license authorizes the holder to establish and operate a brewery, distillery, or winery at the place described in the license for the manufacture of beverages within this state. The license does not authorize more than one of the activities of operator of a brewery or distillery or winery and a separate license shall be required for each plant.
      </li>
      <li id="t03c06s3-6-1ol1b">
       The license also authorizes the sale at wholesale, at the licensed place by the manufacturer of the product of the licensed plant, to another license holder and the transportation and delivery from the place of sale to a licensed place or to a common carrier for that delivery. The license does authorize the sale of beverages for consumption on premises where sold; provided that the manufacturer does not sell an amount in excess of thirty-six ounces (36 oz.) of malt beverage or four and one-half ounces (4.5 oz.) of distilled spirits per visitor, per day, or a combination not greater than three (3) drinks where a drink is defined as twelve ounces (12 oz.) of beer or one and one-half ounces (1.5 oz.) of spirits, for consumption on the premises. The license also authorizes the sale of beverages produced on the premises in an amount not in excess of forty-eight (48) twelve-ounce (12 oz.) bottles or cans or forty-eight (48) sixteen-ounce (16 oz.) bottles or cans of malt beverages, or one thousand five hundred milliliters (1,500 ml) of distilled spirits per visitor, per day, to be sold in containers that may hold no more than seventy-two ounces (72 oz.) each. These beverages may be sold to the consumers for off-premises consumption, and shall be sold pursuant to the laws governing retail Class A establishments. The containers for the sale of beverages for off-premises consumption shall be sealed. The license does not authorize the sale of beverages in this state for delivery outside this state in violation of the law of the place of delivery. The license holder may provide to visitors, in conjunction with a tour or tasting, samples, clearly marked as samples, not to exceed three hundred seventy-five milliliters (375 ml) per visitor for distilled spirits and seventy-two ounces (72 oz.) per visitor for malt beverages at the licensed plant by the manufacturer of the product of the licensed plant to visitors for off-premises consumption. The license does not authorize providing samples to a visitor of any alcoholic beverages for off-premises consumption that are not manufactured at the licensed plant. All manufacturer licenses conducting retail sales or providing samples shall be subject to compliance with alcohol server training and liquor liability insurance requirements set forth in §§ 3-7-6.1 and 3-7-29 and the regulations promulgated thereunder.
      </li>
      <li id="t03c06s3-6-1ol1c">
       The annual fee for the license is three thousand dollars ($3,000) for a distillery producing more than fifty thousand gallons (50,000 gal.) per year and five hundred dollars ($500) for a distillery producing less than or equal to fifty thousand gallons (50,000 gal.) per year; five hundred dollars ($500) for a brewery; and one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) for a winery producing more than fifty thousand gallons (50,000 gal.) per year and five hundred dollars ($500) per year for a winery producing less than fifty thousand gallons (50,000 gal.) per year. All those fees are prorated to the year ending December 1 in every calendar year and shall be paid to the general treasurer for the use of the state.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In cities and towns having a population of less than ten thousand (10,000) inhabitants, a retailer’s Class A license authorizes the holder to keep for sale and to sell at the place described beverages at retail and to deliver the beverages in a sealed package or container, which package or container shall not be opened nor its contents consumed on the premises where sold. The sale of any quantity of beverages to a nonlicense holder constitutes a sale at retail. These provisions shall not be construed to limit the powers of the department of business regulation to issue licenses on condition, nor to make rules and regulations as provided. The annual fee for the license is four hundred dollars ($400) prorated to the year ending December 1 of every calendar year.

       In cities and towns having a population of ten thousand (10,000) or more inhabitants, a retailer’s Class A license authorizes the holder to keep for sale and to sell, at the place described, beverages at retail and to deliver the beverages in a sealed package or container, which package or container shall not be opened nor its contents consumed on the premises where sold. The holder of a Class A license, if other than a person entitled to retail, compound, and dispense medicines and poisons, shall not on the licensed premises engage in any other business, keep for sale or sell any goods, wares, merchandise or any other article or thing except the beverages authorized under this license and nonalcoholic beverages. This provision shall not apply to the sale or selling of cigarettes, newspapers, cigars, cigarette lighters, gift bags, prepackaged peanuts, pretzels, chips, olives, onions, cherries, hot stuffed cherry peppers, Slim Jims and similar pre-packaged dried meat products, pickled eggs, popcorn, pre-packaged candy, styrofoam cooler, lemons, limes, and ice, nor to home bar accessories such as pourers, glasses, cork screws, stirrers, flasks, jiggers, wine racks, ice crushers, bottle openers, can openers and any other items of like nature which may, by suitable regulation of the director of business regulation, be authorized to be sold. A holder of a Class A license will not be prohibited from providing ATM machines to the general public for use on its licensed premises. This section shall not apply to promotional free goods which are subject to approval by the director. In the city of Newport this license may be issued to any person, firm or corporation who are owners of bona fide markets for the sale of alcoholic beverages in conjunction with and in addition to the sale of meats or groceries in those bona fide markets. A person, firm or corporation in that city may obtain a limited Class A license to sell beer, lager and ale on the same premises as other goods, wares, merchandise and articles are sold. No Class A license is granted for any premises unless the premises constitute a separate store, the entrance or entrances to which shall be exclusively from the street or streets or arcade. This provision shall not apply to any person, firm or corporation in the city of Newport who are owners of bona fide markets for the sale of alcoholic beverages in conjunction with and in addition to the sale of meats or groceries in those bona fide markets and as long as the market is owned and operated by the mother, father, son, daughter, brother or sister of the original licensee, but not otherwise.
      </li>
      <li id="t03c07s3-7-3ol1b">
       The premises shall have opaque walls which shall completely partition and sever the premises from any adjoining market, concession or business. This provision shall not be construed to limit the powers of the department to issue licenses on condition nor to make rules and regulations as provided. The annual fee for a Class A license is five hundred dollars ($500) to one thousand dollars ($1,000) prorated to the year ending December 1st in every calendar year.

     <p>
      Any holder of a Class A retail license shall be permitted to conduct at no charge to the consumer, inside the premises of the licensee, sample tastings of wine (under 13% alcohol by volume), beer (under 5.5% alcohol by volume), and distilled spirits available for purchase from the licensee’s outlet. These samples shall not exceed one-ounce servings of each wine, the number of wines being limited to no more than four (4) products at any one tasting; and one-ounce servings of each beer, with the number of beer samplings being limited to two (2) products at any one tasting; and one-quarter-ounce servings (1/4 oz.) of each distilled spirit, the number of distilled spirits being limited to no more than two (2) products at any one tasting. Furthermore, wine, beer, and distilled spirits samplings may not be conducted simultaneously on the same Class A licensed premise. Each consumer shall be limited to no more than one sample tasting of each product. The licensee may elect, once during the month of March, and once during the month of November only, to serve unlimited samples of wine products available for purchase from the licensee’s outlet.
     </p>
     <p>
      It shall be required that the licensee provide, at no charge to the consumer, food samplings to be included with the tasting of all wine and beer. Those food samplings not consumed during the tasting shall not thereafter be offered for sale.
     </p>
     <p>
      The licensee shall control, without wholesaler or supplier participation, the dispensing of all samples to prospective customers. The licensee may not hold more than ten (10) tasting events in any thirty-day (30) period. It shall be required that the licensee provide to the dispenser(s) of said wine and beer samples, training in the service of alcoholic beverages by a recognized training provider of alcoholic beverage service.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sampling events may not be promoted except on the licensed premises. It shall be unlawful for any wholesaler, manufacturer, supplier, or any other person or entity to participate or provide anything or any service of value on account of or in conjunction with any such sampling. It shall be unlawful for any tasting, or combination of tastings, to exceed more than four (4) hours from start to finish and must be conducted during the normal hours of business.

      It is permissible for the holder of a retailer’s Class E license to hold a retailer’s Class A license. No Class A license shall be granted to a holder of a Class E license unless the holder of a Class E license maintains, operates, manages, or conducts a drugstore. The drugstore shall be operated as a self-contained and independent establishment and shall not be located in, or be operated as, a part of any market, department store, or hardware store. For a Class A license as described, the holder of a Class E license shall pay the regular annual license fee and have the full privilege of a Class A license. Provided, however, the licensing authority for the city of Providence may relieve the holder of a Class E license from the requirement to maintain, operate, manage, or conduct a drugstore as a condition of the continued holding of a Class A license, issued to or renewed by said licensee.

     <p>
      The holder of a Class A, Class B, Class C, Class D, Class E, or Class J license who applies before October 1 in any licensing period for a license of the same class for the next succeeding licensing period is prima facie entitled to renewal to the extent that the license is issuable under § 3-5-16. This application may be rejected for cause, subject to appeal as provided in § 3-7-21. A person whose application has been rejected by the local licensing authorities shall, for the purpose of license quotas under § 3-5-16, be deemed to have been granted a license until the period for an appeal has expired or until his or her appeal has been dismissed. The license holder may be required to pay a twenty-five dollar ($25.00) fee upon application of renewal, at the option of local licensing authorities. This fee shall be used by the local licensing authority for advertising and administrative costs related to processing the renewal application.

The extended hours permit shall not permit the sale of alcohol during the extended one-hour period and shall prohibit the admittance of new patrons in the establishment during the extended one-hour period. The designation of such district(s) shall be for a duration of not less than six (6) months. Prior to designating any such district, the local licensing authority shall hold a hearing on the proposed designation. The proposed designation shall include the boundaries of the proposed district, the applicable days for the extended hours, and the duration of the designation and the conditions imposed. The proposed designation shall be advertised at least once per week for three (3) weeks prior to the hearing in a newspaper in general circulation in the city or town. The city or town will establish an application process for an extended hours permit for such license holder and may adopt rules and regulations to administer the permit.

        Court construed this section as it had been administratively construed, noting that over the years a Class B licensee had been permitted to provide its patrons with a variety of entertainment, including shows, performances, or exhibitions by vocalists, pianists, guitarists, musical combinations of various types, “MCs,” exotic dancers, folk singers, other kinds of singing groups, and the like, with apparently the only limitation being that the entertainment, whatever its nature, had to be incidental to the principal business of providing food and drink to patrons; that no separate charge was to be made for it; that the licensing provisions of chap. 22, title 5, were to be complied with; and that the safety and obscenity standards established by § 5-22-5 were to be satisfied.

        Because a class-B retailer’s license and a victualing-house license are distinct, the city council may grant a victualing-house license, thereby allowing food to be prepared and consumed on the premises, while the same city council members, sitting as the board of license commissioners, may simultaneously deny the transfer or issuance of a class-B retailer’s license, thereby prohibiting alcoholic beverages from being served.

        A class-B retailer’s license and a victualing-house license confer two distinct privileges on a single licensee.

        That portion of this section which provides that a Class B licensee shall not be permitted to hold dances within the licensed premises, unless proper permits have been properly obtained from the local licensing authorities, does not refer to the incidental kind of entertainment which may be provided for patrons while they are dining and for which they pay no separate charge. Instead, it refers to the holding of dances to which admission can be obtained only by the payment of a separate fee or charge, and it allows that kind of dancing, even though not incidental to the principal activity of an innkeeper, to be held on the premises of a Class B licensee.

        A retailer’s Class C license — commonly known as a saloon-keeper’s license — authorizes the selling of alcoholic beverages at retail for consumption upon the premises and permits the serving without specific charge therefor of such things as popcorn, crackers, pretzels, sausages, pickles, potato chips, etc. Specifically forbidden is the cooking of any foods upon the premises, although pre-packaged food cooked and prepared off the premises may be warmed and sold on the premises.

      If at the time of or after the issue of any Class C license, the place licensed shall have an opening from within the licensed place into any other part of the same structure or into any adjoining structure, the license shall be void. A sale, by any person holding any class of license under the provisions of this title, of any beverage to an unlicensed dealer in any beverage or to any owner or keeper of any house of ill fame, with reason to believe that the beverage is to be resold, shall be sufficient cause for the revocation of the license. The holder shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars ($100) or imprisoned not more than thirty (30) days, or both. Any person whose license is revoked is disqualified from holding any license of any kind under the provisions of this title for the period of five (5) years following the date of the revocation.

     <p>
      A retailer’s Class D license shall be issued only to a club or to any corporation organized prior to the year 1900 for purposes similar to those set forth in chapter 6 of title 7, and which has held a Class D license for at least ten (10) consecutive years prior to July 1, 1993, and authorizes the holder of the license to keep for sale and to sell beverages at the place described at retail and to deliver those beverages for consumption on the premises where sold. The license authorizes the holder of the license to keep for sale and sell beverages, including beer in cans, at retail at the place described and to deliver those beverages for consumption on the premises. If a club is not the owner or, for the period of two (2) years before the filing of its application for a license, the lessee of the premises where its principal activities are carried on or of kitchen and dining room equipment in the club premises reasonably adequate to supply its members and guests with food, then the license shall authorize the holder of the license to keep for sale and sell malt and vinous beverages, but not beverages consisting in whole or in part of alcohol produced by distillation. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, with the written permission of the local authority, the licensee may supply food and beverage to the public for consumption on the premises at times determined by the holder of the license. The annual fee for the license to sell beverages shall be not more than eight hundred dollars ($800) and for the license to sell malt and vinous beverages only shall be not more than four hundred dollars ($400), in each case prorated to the year ending December 1 in every calendar year determined by each local municipality; provided, further, a municipality may establish separate and lower annual fees for Class D licenses for veterans’ halls with a capacity of not more than one hundred (100) persons.

        A Class I retail license (former § 3-7-16) authorizes the selling of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises, but only at tables. While generally it has many of the same characteristics as a Class B retail license, it differs in that Class I premises may be open for business only between the hours of six o’clock p.m. and one o’clock a.m. daily except Sunday, whereas at a Class B establishment, while it must keep open for business regularly at least from 9 o’clock a.m. to 7 o’clock p.m., beverages may not be sold or served after 1 o’clock a.m. nor before six o’clock a.m. A further difference is that minors are not allowed upon the premises of a Class I establishment.

        The bankruptcy court was not prohibited by this section from authorizing the transfer of a liquor license, free and clear of liens, even though a certificate of good standing had not been issued by the state division of taxation stating that all taxes had been paid. In re Hoffman,

        A trustee in bankruptcy is entitled to transfer the debtor’s liquor license free and clear of any tax liabilities owed by the debtor/licensee to the state. In re Hoffman,

        The tax administrator, as a creditor of a defendant (liquor licensee), is barred by § 3-5-19 from objecting to the transfer of the liquor license by the receiver pursuant to a court-authorized sale. 632 Metacom Assocs. v. Pub Dennis of Warren, Inc.,

       </p>
       <p>
        To the extent that §§ 3-5-19 and 3-7-24 impose upon the tax administrator conflicting obligations, § 3-7-24 specifically repealed the inconsistent provisions of all preceding statutes, including § 3-5-19, insofar as such statutes would attempt to prohibit the tax administrator from fulfilling his statutory obligation under § 3-7-24 to ensure that all delinquent state taxes have been paid prior to the transfer of a liquor license. 632 Metacom Assocs. v.

        The Rhode Island tax administrator cannot use this section as a cudgel to club a trustee in bankruptcy into submitting to the monetary demands of the division of taxation as a precondition to transfer of a debtor’s liquor license. In re Pub Dennis of Mineral Spring Ave., Inc.,

       <p>
        The state may not condition the transfer or renewal of a liquor license in a bankruptcy estate on the payment of pre-petition taxes, even though some or all of those taxes may represent so called “trust-fund” taxes. In re Gillson,

      Any person who, by the use of wood alcohol or other similar substance, adulterates any liquid intended to be used as a drink by a human being, is liable in treble damages to any person who consumes that adulterated preparation which the party consuming that adulterated preparation suffers. If the party consuming that adulterated preparation dies within one year after consuming that adulterated preparation, as a result of the consumption, the party guilty of the adulteration is deemed guilty of unlawful homicide in any degree in which the jury trying the case finds.

      A person who has placed an order with the department of business regulation for the importation of malt beverages into this state under the provisions of § 3-10-16, shall file a duplicate copy of that order with the tax administrator. The administrator shall determine the amount of tax due in connection with that order under the provisions of § 3-10-17. Notice of the amount of the tax determined shall be certified to the general treasurer. The tax shall be paid to the general treasurer as a condition precedent to the forwarding of the order by the department of business regulation. If the order is placed by a licensee who engages to store the beverages ordered or any part of them in the warehouse of the department of business regulation, then the payment of the tax may be deferred until the beverages are withdrawn from the warehouse, and in that case as beverages are withdrawn the tax shall be paid.

The arbitration proceeding shall be held within the state and shall be governed by chapter 3 of title 10.

No supplier who, pursuant to an agreement with a wholesaler, has designated a sales territory for which the wholesaler is primarily responsible or in which the wholesaler is required to concentrate its efforts, shall enter into an agreement with any other wholesaler during that one year period for the purpose of establishing an additional wholesaler for any of its brands or products. Notwithstanding any pending arbitration proceeding, a party may petition the superior court in accordance with § 3-13-11 to obtain any relief as may be necessary to enforce this section.

     <p>
      Except for discontinuance of all sales of a brand or brands in this state or for good cause, any person who purchases a supplier becomes obligated to all of the terms of any agreement in effect on the date of purchase. The acquiring supplier is not obligated to supply its brand or brands to the wholesalers of the acquired supplier. Nothing prevents the parties from negotiating a new agreement consistent with the provisions of this chapter. The term purchase includes, but is not limited to, a purchase of stock, purchase of assets, lease, merger, or any other reorganization, consolidation, or acquisition of a supplier.

        Plaintiff could not show that the social hosts were liable pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 3-14-5 for injuries sustained after the social hosts supplied alcohol to the plaintiff and her boyfriend for more than a three-hour period, and the boyfriend then drove away with the plaintiff in a vehicle that soon struck a utility pole.
