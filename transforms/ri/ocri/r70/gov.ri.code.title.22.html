It is intended that the senatorial or representative districts described herein completely encompass all the area within the state and contain all the population residing in the state. It is further intended that the apportionment and districting provided for in this act results in the creation of districts containing substantially equal population. It is also intended that no senatorial or representative district shall include any of the area included within the description of any other senatorial or representative district. If the districts described in this act do not carry out the purposes thereof because of patent unintentional omissions, duplications, overlapping area, erroneous nomenclature, faulty description of boundary lines, street closings, changes in names of streets or of public places, alteration of the courses of rivers or streams, the filling in of lands under water or changes in shorelines due to accretion, the secretary of state is hereby authorized and empowered to correct such omissions, overlaps, erroneous nomenclature, or other defects in the description of districts so as to accomplish the purposes and objectives of this act. In making such corrections, the secretary of state shall be guided by the following standards:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(1) gaps in the description of any district shall be completed in a manner which results in a total description of the district in manner consonant with the description of adjacent districts;

        Where an overall deviation in population in challenged Senate districts as a result of redistricting under R.I. Gen. Laws § 22-1-2 was less than 10 percent, the actual deviations were de minimis for purposes of a claim by voters and residents that the redistricting resulted in invidious discrimination under U.S. Const. amend. XIV so as to require justification by Rhode Island; there was no equal protection violation shown and no extremely close violation for purposes of finding the redistricting legislation unconstitutional under the compactness requirement of R.I. Const. art. VIII, § 1. Parella v. Montalbano,

        Rhode Island Supreme Court holds that voters and residents of certain redistricted areas pursuant to a redistricting plan encompassed within R.I. Gen. Laws § 22-1-2 did not meet their burden of overcoming the presumption of the constitutionality of § 22-1-2 with proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the redistricting resulted in a violation of the Compactness Clause of R.I. Const. art. VIII, § 1; the principles of compactness and continguity were not violated, there was no political gerrymandering, each district had communities of interest, there was no unlawful populaton deviations, and the redistricting overall was reasonable and rational.

        “Compactness” as used in R.I. Const. art. VIII, § 1 referred to more than geography for purposes of determining that it was met by the redistricting plan encompassed within R.I. Gen. Laws § 22-1-2; compactness was determined by a qualitative approach with the goal of maintaining effective representation in the districts, and factors considered included contiguity, political gerrymandering, communities of interest, geographical, natural, historical, and political boundary concerns, and functional compactness.

      This chapter and chapter 2 of this title shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes of them and to apportion the state into senatorial or representative districts in compliance with the requirements of the United States Constitution. It is intended that the senatorial or representative districts described in these chapters completely encompass all the area within the state and contain all the citizens resident in the state.

      The standing committees of the house of representatives as established by the rules of the house of representatives and the standing committees of the senate as established by the rules of the senate shall in the performance of their duties have the power upon majority vote of the committee members present and with the written approval of the speaker for committees of the house and with the written approval of the president of the senate for committees of the senate to issue witness subpoenas, subpoenas duces tecum, and orders for the production of books, accounts, papers, records, and documents which shall be signed and issued by the chairperson of the committee, or a person serving in his or her capacity, and shall be returnable to the chairperson. All subpoenas and orders shall be served as subpoenas in civil cases in the superior court are now served, and witnesses so subpoenaed shall be entitled to the same fees for attendance and travel as now provided for witnesses in civil cases in the superior court. If the person subpoenaed to attend before the committee fails to obey the command of the subpoena without reasonable cause, or refuses to be sworn, or to be examined, or to answer a legal and pertinent question, or if any person shall refuse to produce books, accounts, papers, records, and documents material to the issue, set forth in an order duly served on that person, the committee by majority vote of the committee members present may apply to any justice of the superior court, for any county, upon proof by affidavit of the fact, for a rule or order returnable in not less than two (2) nor more than five (5) days, directing the person to show cause before the justice who made the order or any other justice described above why he or she should not be adjudged in contempt. Upon the return of the orders the justice before whom the matter is brought on for hearing shall examine under oath that person, and the person shall be given an opportunity to be heard, and if the justice shall determine that the person has refused without reasonable cause or legal excuse to be examined or to answer a legal and pertinent question, or to produce books, accounts, papers, records, and documents material to the issue which he or she was ordered to bring or produce, the justice may immediately commit the offender to the adult correctional institutions, there to remain until he or she submits to do the act which he or she was required to do, or is discharged according to law.

        A rule of the Rhode Island house of representatives which was interpreted and enforced so as to allow governmental lobbyists onto the floor of the house while the house was in session, while denying lobbyists for private organizations the same access, was an unconstitutional time, place, and manner restriction on expressive activity in a limited public forum.

        A rule of the Rhode Island house of representatives which was interpreted and enforced so as to allow governmental lobbyists onto the floor of the house while the house was in session, while denying lobbyists for private organizations the same access, was an unconstitutional time, place, and manner restriction on expressive activity in a limited public forum.

        Insofar as the speaker of the House in Rhode Island and the head doorkeeper enforced House Rule 45, which controls admission to the floor, against private lobbyists but spared governmental lobbyists from exclusion, those individuals acted within the legislative sphere and are protected from judicial interference by the doctrine of absolute legislative immunity.

       The general assembly recognizes that the security of government computer systems is essential to ensuring the stability and integrity of vital information gathered and stored by government for the benefit of the citizenry and the breach of security over computer systems presents a risk to the health, safety, and welfare of the public. It is the intent of the legislature to insure that government computer systems and information residing on these systems are protected from unauthorized access, compromise, sabotage, hacking, viruses, destruction, illegal use, cyber attack or any other act which might jeopardize or harm the computer systems and the information stored on them.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c13s22-13-10ol1b">
       In conjunction with the powers and duties outlined in this chapter, the auditor general may conduct reviews and assessments of the various government computer systems and the security systems established to safeguard these computer systems. Computer systems subject to this section shall include systems which pertain to federal, state, or local programs, and quasi-governmental bodies, and the computer systems of any entity or program which is subject to audit by the office of the auditor general. The auditor general’s review may include an assessment of system vulnerability, network penetration, potential security breaches, and susceptibility to cyber attack and cyber fraud.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c13s22-13-10ol1c">
       In the event the review by the auditor general indicates a computer system is vulnerable, or security over the system is lacking, those findings shall not be disclosed publicly and shall not be considered public records. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the workpapers developed in connection with the review of the computer system and the security over the system shall not be deemed public records and are not subject to disclosure. The auditor general’s findings may be disclosed at the discretion of the auditor general to the chief information officer of the state as well as the joint committee on legislative services. Unless the auditor general authorizes the release of information or findings gathered in the conduct of a review of computer system security, all such information shall be deemed classified, confidential, secret, and non-public.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c13s22-13-10ol1d">
       In order to maintain the integrity of the computer system, the auditor general may procure the services of specialists in information security systems or other contractors deemed necessary in conducting reviews under this section, and in procuring those services shall be exempt from the requirements of the state purchasing law or regulation.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c13s22-13-10ol1e">
       Any outside contractor or vendor hired to provide services in the review of the security of a computer system shall be bound by the confidentiality provisions of this section.
