        In this section, “redeemable shares” means shares issued pursuant to § 7-1.2-602(c)(1). When redeemable shares are called for redemption, those shares are not outstanding shares for the purpose of voting or determining the total number of shares entitled to vote on any matter on and after the date on which written notice of redemption has been sent to holders thereof and a sum sufficient to redeem such shares has been set aside to pay the redemption price to the holders of the shares upon surrender of certificates therefor.

       Subject to any provisions in respect to rights and options stated in its articles of incorporation, a corporation may create and issue, whether or not in connection with the issuance and sale of any of its shares or other securities, rights or options entitling the holders to purchase from the corporation shares of any class or classes. Those rights or options are evidenced, and the recipients thereof designated, in any manner that the board of directors approves and, subject to the provisions of the articles of incorporation, shall state the terms upon which, the time or times within which and the price or prices at which the shares may be purchased from the corporation upon the exercise of any right or option. In the absence of fraud in the transaction, the judgment of the board of directors as to the adequacy of the consideration received for the rights or options is conclusive.

An annual meeting of shareholders may be held at any time that is stated or fixed in accordance with the bylaws. Failure to hold the annual meeting at the designated time does not work a forfeiture or dissolution of the corporation.

         Superior court properly dismissed an employee/shareholder’s claim under the Business Corporation Act (BCA) because the alleged violations of the BCA by the corporation and its president—how shareholder meetings were conducted and the process by which shareholders and others exercised their right to review a corporation’s books and records—qualified as “internal affairs” that Rhode Island was unauthorized to regulate because the corporation was incorporated in Delaware; supporting this conclusion was the fact that R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 7-1.2-701 and 7-1.2-1502 use the term “corporation” and not “foreign corporation.” Rein v. ESS Grp., Inc.,

        For the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment of a meeting of shareholders, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other proper purpose, the board of directors of a corporation may provide that stock transfer books are closed for a stated period, not less than that specified in any applicable bylaw and not more than sixty (60) days. In lieu of closing the stock transfer books, the bylaws, or in the absence of an applicable bylaw, the board of directors may fix in advance a date as the record date for any determination of shareholders, the date in any case to be not more than sixty (60) days prior to the date on which the particular action, requiring the determination of shareholders, is to be taken. If the stock transfer books are not closed and no record date is fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders, or shareholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend, the date on which notice of the meeting is mailed or the date on which the resolution of the board of directors declaring the dividend is adopted, as the case may be, is the record date for the determination of shareholders. When a determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders has been made as provided in this section, the determination applies to any adjournment of the meeting.

       <li id="t07c1.2p07s7-1.2-703ol1b">
        In order that the corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the board of directors may fix a record date, which record date may not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the board of directors is required by this chapter, is the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in this state, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of shareholders are recorded. Delivery made to a corporation’s registered office must be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the board of directors and prior action by the board of directors is required by this chapter, the record date for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting is the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

        Any number of shareholders of a corporation may create a voting trust for the purpose of conferring upon a trustee or trustees the right to vote or otherwise represent their shares, for a period not to exceed ten (10) years, by entering into a written voting trust agreement specifying the terms and conditions of the voting trust, by depositing a counterpart of the agreement with the corporation at its registered office, and by transferring their shares to the trustee or trustees for the purposes of the agreement. The trustee or trustees shall keep a record of the holders of voting trust certificates evidencing a beneficial interest in the voting trust, giving the names and addresses of all the holders and the number and class of the shares in respect of which the voting trust certificates held by each are issued, and shall deposit a copy of the record with the corporation at its registered office. The counterpart of the voting trust agreement and the copy of the record deposited with the corporation are subject to the same right of examination by a shareholder of the corporation, in person or by agent or attorney, as are the books and records of the corporation, and the counterpart and the copy of the record is subject to examination by any holder of record of voting trust certificates, either in person or by agent or attorney, at any reasonable time for any proper purpose. The trust certificates must state that they are issued pursuant to the voting trust agreement, and that fact must be stated in the stock ledger of the corporation.

        Agreements among shareholders regarding the voting of their shares are valid and enforceable in accordance with their terms for a period not to exceed ten (10) years. An agreement is not subject to the provision of this section regarding voting trusts unless it is stated in the agreement that it is a voting trust.

       <li id="t07c1.2p07s7-1.2-709ol1c">
        The provisions of this section are construed as permissive and should not be interpreted to invalidate any voting or other agreement among shareholders, or any irrevocable proxy which is otherwise not illegal.

      <p>
       The board of directors of a corporation consists of one or more members. The number of directors is fixed by, or in the manner provided in, the articles of incorporation or the bylaws. The number of directors may be increased or decreased from time to time by amendment to, or in the manner provided in, the articles of incorporation or the bylaws, but no decrease has the effect of shortening the term of any incumbent director. If the articles of incorporation provide for the election of directors in the manner specified in subsection (d) of § 7-1.2-708, the number of directors may not be decreased unless approved by the shareholders with less than the number of shares previously entitled to elect one director voting against the decrease. Initial directors hold office until the first annual meeting of shareholders, and until their successors have been elected and qualified. At the first annual meeting of shareholders and at each subsequent annual meeting, the shareholders shall elect directors to hold office until the next succeeding annual meeting, except in the case of the classification of directors as permitted by this chapter. Each director holds office for the term for which he or she is elected and until his or her successor has been elected and qualified. Any director may resign at any time upon notice given in writing to the corporation.

      <p>
       When the board of directors consists of nine (9) or more members, in lieu of electing the whole number of directors annually, the articles of incorporation may provide that the directors be divided into either two (2) or three (3) classes, each class to be as nearly equal in number as possible, the term of office of directors of the first class to expire at the first annual meeting of shareholders after their election, that of the second class to expire at the second annual meeting after their election, and that of the third class, if any, to expire at the third annual meeting after their election. At each annual meeting after the classification, the number of directors equal to the number of the class whose term expires at the time of the meeting will be elected to hold office until the second succeeding annual meeting, if there are two (2) classes, or until the third succeeding annual meeting, if there are three (3) classes. No classification of directors is effective prior to the first annual meeting of shareholders. The articles of incorporation may confer upon holders of any class or series of shares the right to elect one or more directors who serve for any term and have any voting powers stated in the articles of incorporation. The terms of office and voting powers of the directors elected in the manner provided in the articles of incorporation may be greater than or less than those of any other director or class of directors.

      <p>
       Any vacancy occurring in the board of directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors though less than a quorum of the board of directors. A director elected to fill a vacancy is elected for the unexpired term of his or her predecessor in office. Any directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of directors may be filled by the board of directors for a term of office continuing only until the next election of directors by the shareholders. If at any time, by reason of death, resignation or other cause, a corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any shareholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a shareholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a shareholder, may call a special meeting of shareholders in accordance with the provisions of the articles of incorporation or the bylaws, or may apply to the superior court for a decree summarily ordering a meeting for the purposes of conducting an election.

          Setting Aside of Sales.

        <p>
         Since a director of a corporation stands in a fiduciary relationship toward its stockholders, a sale by an officer-director of fishing boats and a gasoline engine belonging to the corporation, without prior authorization or later ratification by the board of directors or stockholders, may be set aside by the corporation.

         A corporation being entitled to set aside the unauthorized sale of corporate property by a director to himself is not estopped because of retention of money paid contemporaneously with the sale, since it cannot be charged with acquiescence of the transaction unless it had full knowledge of the facts, or once having acquired it substantially later, delayed unduly thereafter in commencing suit.

         Money paid to the corporation by an officer-director for property belonging to the corporation which he has sold to himself may not be retained by the corporation, because if it is allowed to cancel and set aside the sale, justice requires that the officer-director be put in status quo and have restored to him that which he has paid.

        Any shareholder electing to exercise the right of dissent shall file with the corporation, prior to or at the meeting of shareholders at which the proposed corporate action is submitted to a vote, a written objection to the proposed corporate action. If the proposed corporate action is approved by the required vote and the shareholder has not voted in favor of it, the shareholder may, within ten (10) days after the date on which the vote was taken, or if a corporation is to be merged without a vote of its shareholders into another corporation, any of its shareholders may, within fifteen (15) days after the plan of the merger has been mailed to the shareholders, make written demand on the corporation, or, in the case of a merger, on the surviving or new corporation, domestic or foreign, for payment of the fair value of the shareholder’s shares. If the proposed corporate action is effected, the corporation shall pay to the shareholder, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates representing the shares, the fair value of the shares as of the day prior to the date on which the vote was taken approving the proposed corporate action, excluding any appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of the corporate action. Any shareholder failing to make demand within the ten (10) day period or the fifteen (15) day period, as the case may be, is bound by the terms of the proposed corporate action. Any shareholder making the demand is thereafter only entitled to payment as provided in this section and is not entitled to vote or to exercise any other rights of a shareholder.
       </li>
       <li id="t07c1.2p12s7-1.2-1202ol1b">
        No demand may be withdrawn unless the corporation consents to it. If, however, the demand is withdrawn upon consent, or if the proposed corporate action is abandoned or rescinded or the shareholders revoke the authority to effect the action, or if, in the case of a merger, on the date of the filing of the articles of merger the surviving corporation is the owner of all the outstanding shares of the other corporations, domestic and foreign, that are parties to the merger, or if no demand or petition for the determination of fair value by a court has been made or filed within the time provided in this section, or if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the shareholder is not entitled to the relief provided by this section, then the right of the shareholder to be paid the fair value of his or her shares ceases and his status as a shareholder is restored, without prejudice to any corporate proceedings taken during the interim.
       </li>
       <li id="t07c1.2p12s7-1.2-1202ol1c">
        Within ten (10) days after the corporate action is effected, the corporation, or, in the case of a merger, the surviving or new corporation, domestic or foreign, shall give written notice of the action to each dissenting shareholder who has made demand as provided in these provisions, and shall make a written offer to each dissenting shareholder to pay for the shares at a specified price deemed by the corporation to be the fair value of the shares. The notice and offer must be accompanied by a balance sheet of the corporation the shares of which the dissenting shareholder holds, as of the latest available date and not more than twelve (12) months prior to the making of the offer, and a profit and loss statement of the corporation for the twelve (12) month period ended on the date of the balance sheet.

        If within thirty (30) days after the date on which the corporate action was effected the fair value of the shares is agreed upon between any dissenting shareholder and the corporation, payment for the shares must be made within ninety (90) days after the date on which the corporate action was effected, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates representing the shares. Upon payment of the agreed value, the dissenting shareholder ceases to have any interest in the shares.
       </li>
       <li id="t07c1.2p12s7-1.2-1202ol1e">
        If within the period of thirty (30) days a dissenting shareholder and the corporation do not agree on the matter, then the corporation, within thirty (30) days after receipt of written request for the filing from any dissenting shareholder given within sixty (60) days after the date on which the corporate action was effected, shall, or at its election at any time within the period of sixty (60) days may, file a petition in any court of competent jurisdiction in the county in this state where the registered office of the corporation is located praying that the fair value of the shares is found and determined. If, in the case of a merger, the surviving or new corporation is a foreign corporation without a registered office in this state, the petition must be filed in the county where the registered office of the domestic corporation was last located. If the corporation fails to institute the proceeding as provided, any dissenting shareholder may do so in the name of the corporation. All dissenting shareholders, wherever they reside, must be made parties to the proceeding as an action against their shares quasi in rem. A copy of the petition must be served on each dissenting shareholder who is a resident of this state and served by registered or certified mail on each dissenting shareholder who is a nonresident. Service on nonresidents may also be made by publication as provided by law. The jurisdiction of the court is plenary and exclusive. All shareholders who are parties to the proceeding are entitled to judgment against the corporation for the amount of the fair value of their shares. The court may, if it so elects, appoint one or more persons as appraisers to receive evidence and recommend a decision on the question of fair value. The appraisers have the power and authority that is specified in the order of their appointment or an amendment of the order. The judgment is payable only upon and concurrently with the surrender to the corporation of the certificate or certificates representing the shares. Upon payment of the judgment, the dissenting shareholder ceases to have any interest in the shares.
       </li>
       <li id="t07c1.2p12s7-1.2-1202ol1f">
        The judgment should include an allowance for interest at the rate of interest on judgments in civil actions from the date on which the vote was taken on the proposed corporate action to the date of payment.
       </li>
       <li id="t07c1.2p12s7-1.2-1202ol1g">
        The court shall determine and assess the costs and expenses of any proceeding against the corporation, but all or any part of the costs and expenses may be apportioned and assessed as the court deems equitable against any or all of the dissenting shareholders who are parties to the proceeding to whom the corporation has made an offer to pay for the shares if the court finds that the action of the shareholders in failing to accept the offer was arbitrary or vexatious or not in good faith. The expenses include reasonable compensation for and reasonable expenses of the appraisers, but exclude the fees and expenses of counsel for and experts employed by any party; but if the fair value of the shares as determined materially exceeds the amount which the corporation offered to pay for the shares, or if no offer was made, the court in its discretion may award to any shareholder who is a party to the proceeding a sum that the court determines to be reasonable compensation to any expert or experts employed by the shareholder in the proceeding.
       </li>
       <li id="t07c1.2p12s7-1.2-1202ol1h">
        Within twenty (20) days after demanding payment for his or her shares, each shareholder demanding payment shall submit the certificate or certificates representing his or her shares to the corporation for notation on the certificate that the demand has been made. His or her failure to do so may, at the option of the corporation, terminate his or her rights under this section unless a court of competent jurisdiction, for good and sufficient cause shown, directs otherwise. If shares represented by a certificate on which notation has been made are transferred, each new certificate issued for the shares must bear similar notation, together with the name of the original dissenting holder of the shares, and a transferee of the shares acquires by the transfer no rights in the corporation other than those which the original dissenting shareholder had after making demand for payment of the fair value of the shares.
       </li>
       <li id="t07c1.2p12s7-1.2-1202ol1i">
        Shares acquired by a corporation pursuant to payment of the agreed value for the shares or to payment of the judgment entered for the shares, as provided in this section, may be held and disposed of by the corporation. However, in the case of a merger, they may be held and disposed of as the plan of merger otherwise provides.

         The trial court erred in basing an interest award upon an equitable rate of interest per subsection (f); former § 7-1.1-90.1 (see now § 7-1.2-1315) limited the use of the procedures in former § 7-1.1-74 (see now this section) solely to determining the purchase price, or fair value, of the shares involved, and not to ascertaining what interest shall be awarded.

         The provisions linking the measure of damages for conversion with the phrase “full and fair value” were not intended to define restrictively the meaning of that phrase but rather were intended to fix the time as of which such value was to be determined by an exercise of the appraisal procedure.

         If the shareholder seeks nothing more than the value of his shares, then appraisal is the exclusive remedy. On the other hand, when there are allegations of fraud, unfair dealing or breaches of fiduciary obligations, the plaintiff should not be deprived of other remedies such as rescission and injunctive relief that might be necessary to restore him to the position he otherwise would have occupied.

       <li id="t07c1.2p13s7-1.2-1303ol11">
        The board of directors adopts a resolution recommending that the corporation be dissolved, and directing that the question of the dissolution be submitted to a vote at a meeting of the shareholders, which may be either an annual or a special meeting.

       <li id="t07c1.2p13s7-1.2-1303ol12">
        Written notice is given to each shareholder entitled to vote at the meeting within the time and in the manner provided in this chapter for the giving of notice of meetings of shareholders, and, whether the meeting is an annual or special meeting, states that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the advisability of dissolving the corporation.
       </li>
       <li id="t07c1.2p13s7-1.2-1303ol13">
        At the meeting a vote of shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting is taken on a resolution to dissolve the corporation. The resolution is adopted upon receiving the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of the corporation entitled to vote on the resolution, unless any class of shares is entitled to vote on the resolution as a class, in which event approval of the resolution also requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of each class of shares entitled to vote as a class and of the total shares entitled to vote on the resolution.
       </li>
       <li id="t07c1.2p13s7-1.2-1303ol14">
        The corporation shall immediately deliver notice of the adoption of such resolution by a vote of the shareholders to each known creditor of the corporation.

       <li id="t07c1.2p13s7-1.2-1303ol15">
        The corporation shall proceed to collect its assets, sell or otherwise dispose of those of its properties that are not to be distributed in kind to its shareholders, pay, satisfy, and discharge its liabilities and obligations and do all other acts required to liquidate its business and affairs. After paying or adequately providing for the payment of all its obligations, the corporation distributes the remainder of its assets, either in cash or in kind, among its shareholders according to their respective rights and interests.
       </li>
       <li id="t07c1.2p13s7-1.2-1303ol16">
        The corporation, at any time during the liquidation of its business and affairs, may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction within the state and county in which the registered office or principal place of business of the corporation is situated, to have the liquidation continued under the supervision of the court as provided in this chapter.

         Appointment of a temporary receiver for the owner of the majority of the condominium units in a condominium – which was also the declarant of the condominium and sold the petitioners’ condominium units to them – was inappropriate because the petitioners lacked standing to file a motion to appoint a temporary receiver in the matter as the petitioners were neither shareholders nor creditors of the owner.

         Superior court may supervise the liquidation of an insolvent corporation under R.I. Gen. Laws § 7-1.2-1314(a)(1)(vi) by appointing a receiver after the corporation has passed a resolution to dissolve under R.I. Gen. Laws § 7-1.2-1302. Accordingly, after shareholders unanimously voted to dissolve a corporation, the trial court properly granted the shareholders’ petition for the appointment of a permanent receiver to oversee the liquidation and eventual dissolution of the insolvent corporation.

         Although the term “oppression” has not been specifically defined by the Supreme Court as it relates to close corporations, it has been defined by other courts to encompass that conduct which deviates from a heightened good faith standard that exists in closely held corporations; this is a more stringent standard than is found in their public counterparts.

        Avoidance of dissolution by share buyout.
       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       Whenever a petition for dissolution of a corporation is filed by one or more shareholders (subsequently in this section referred to as the “petitioner”) pursuant to either § 7-1.2-1314 or a right to compel dissolution which is authorized under § 7-1.2-1701 or is otherwise valid, one or more of its other shareholders may avoid the dissolution by filing with the court prior to the commencement of the hearing, or, in the discretion of the court, at any time prior to a sale or other disposition of the assets of the corporation, an election to purchase the shares owned by the petitioner at a price equal to their fair value. If the shares are to be purchased by other shareholders, notice must be sent to all shareholders of the corporation other than the petitioner, giving them an opportunity to join in the election to purchase the shares. If the parties are unable to reach an agreement as to the fair value of the shares, the court shall, upon the giving of a bond or other security sufficient to assure to the petitioner payment of the value of the shares, stay the proceeding and determine the value of the shares, in accordance with the procedure set forth in § 7-1.2-1202, as of the close of business on the day on which the petition for dissolution was filed. Upon determining the fair value of the shares, the court shall state in its order directing that the shares be purchased, the purchase price and the time within which the payment is to be made, and may decree any other terms and conditions of sale that it determines to be appropriate, including payment of the purchase price in installments extending over a period of time, and, if the shares are to be purchased by shareholders, the allocation of shares among shareholders electing to purchase them, which, so far as practicable, are to be proportional to the number of shares previously owned. The petitioner is entitled to interest, at the rate on judgments in civil actions, on the purchase price of the shares from the date of the filing of the election to purchase the shares, and all other rights of the petitioner as owner of the shares terminate on that date. The costs of the proceeding, which include reasonable compensation and expenses of appraisers but not fees and expenses of counsel or of experts retained by a party, will be allocated between or among the parties as the court determines. Upon full payment of the purchase price, under the terms and conditions specified by the court, or at any other time that is ordered by the court, the petitioner shall transfer the shares to the purchaser.

         By conditioning the election to purchase shares on the owner’s shareholder status, the purchaser was merely holding the shareholder to his proof in establishing his rightful ownership of the shares, a necessary statutory precondition to the shareholder’s initiation and maintenance of a dissolution claim and to the purchaser’s invocation of his buyout election.

      <p>
       In proceedings to liquidate the assets and business of a corporation, the court may require all creditors of the corporation to file with the receiver, in any form that the court prescribes, proofs under oath of their respective claims. If the court requires the filing of claims, it shall fix a date, which is not to be less than four (4) months from the date of the order, as the last day for the filing of claims, and shall prescribe the notice that is to be given to creditors and claimants of the fixed date. Prior to the fixed date, the court may extend the time for the filing of claims. Creditors and claimants failing to file proofs of claim on or before the fixed date may be barred, by court order, from participating in the distribution of the assets of the corporation.

         Default judgment entered against a corporation that had already been dissolved for over two years when the service was effected against it was void ab initio because former § 7-1.1-98 (now this section) provided a two-year statute of repose to bring the action and, beyond that time, there was no right to maintain a cause of action against a dissolved corporation.

         Summary judgment for a Rhode Island corporation was error in suit brought by a Massachusetts corporation because the Massachusetts corporation had a certificate of authority under R.I. Gen. Laws § 7-1.2-1418 when it filed suit, and, although the certificate was later revoked, a certificate was not required in the interim; however, a certificate had to be obtained before proceeding to final judgment. The trial court erred in disregarding the statutory language requiring that such a foreign corporation be “transacting business” within Rhode Island and, as it was undisputed that the Massachusetts corporation was no longer transacting business in Rhode Island, it was not required to hold a certificate of authority.

It is a defense to any action for penalties under this section that the person bringing the suit has within two (2) years sold or offered for sale any list of shareholders or of holders of voting trust certificates for shares of the corporation or any other corporation or has aided or abetted any person in procuring any list of shareholders or of holders of voting trust certificates for that purpose, or has improperly used any information secured through any prior examination of the books and records of account, or minutes, or record of shareholders, or of holders of voting trust certificates for shares of the corporation or any other corporation, or was not acting in good faith or for a proper purpose in making his or her demand.

        <p>
         A corporation is under a legal duty to permit a records examination requested by a minority shareholder if the request is made in good faith and for a proper purpose; the corporation is not excused from doing so merely because the shareholder previously breached a fiduciary duty to the corporation. Any legitimate concern that the corporation may have about the shareholder’s good faith, the propriety of the demand, or the potential misuse of corporate records should be presented to a court for its consideration and possible entry of a protective order concerning such activity.

         An order giving a stockholder access to the corporation’s books and records was proper insofar as it granted him access to records relevant to his stated purpose of evaluating a proposed dividend, but it should have denied access to such proprietary information as customer and supplier lists, contract bids, or profit margins and discounts.

         Superior court properly dismissed an employee/shareholder’s claim under the Business Corporation Act (BCA) because the alleged violations of the BCA by the corporation and its president—how shareholder meetings were conducted and the process by which shareholders and others exercised their right to review a corporation’s books and records—qualified as “internal affairs” that Rhode Island was unauthorized to regulate because the corporation was incorporated in Delaware; supporting this conclusion was the fact that R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 7-1.2-701 and 7-1.2-1502 use the term “corporation” and not “foreign corporation.” Rein v. ESS Grp., Inc.,

         The trial court did not err in holding that the plaintiff failed to prove misappropriation, wrongful denial of access to corporate records, waste of assets, or fraud since the record supported that conclusion and since there was nothing in the record to indicate the existence of any oral bifurcation agreement relating to these issues between the parties and the court.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A person holding stock in a fiduciary capacity is entitled to vote the stock. In the case of stock held jointly by two (2) or more executors, administrators, guardians, conservators, trustees, or other fiduciaries, the fiduciaries may designate, in writing, one or more of their number to represent the stock and vote it, unless there is a provision to the contrary in any instrument defining their powers and duties. A person whose stock is pledged is entitled to vote the stock until the stock is transferred on the books of the corporation to the pledgee, and subsequently the pledgee is entitled to vote the stock.

       If any shareholder becomes ineligible, he or she shall transfer his or her shares to an eligible person or offer them to the corporation for redemption at their fair-market value. If the articles of incorporation or the bylaws of the corporation restrict transfer of its shares, and transfer of the shares to an eligible person is prevented, the corporation shall redeem the shares of the ineligible shareholder, and compensate the ineligible shareholder in full for the fair-market value of his or her shares determined as of the date that the ineligibility occurred. Nothing contained in these provisions is to be interpreted to prevent a shareholder and the corporation from making a binding agreement as to a method for determining the fair-market value or for determining what constitutes the fair-market value of his or her shares. In the event the corporation and an ineligible shareholder cannot agree as to the fair-market value, the regulatory agency excluding the division of professional regulation shall, upon application by either party, appoint a board of not less than three (3) qualified persons engaged in performing similar professional services to determine the fair-market value of the shares, and the decision of the board is final and binding upon the parties. The division of professional regulation shall, upon application by either party, appoint a neutral arbitrator with experience in business valuation whose fees will be paid by the corporation petitioner to determine the fair-market value of the shares, and the decision of the arbitrator is final and binding upon the parties. The redemption of its shares by a professional service corporation shall not be effected at a time or in a manner so as to impair or prejudice the rights or remedies of any creditor of the corporation. As used in this chapter, “ineligible shareholder” includes a shareholder electing to retire or withdraw from active employment in the corporation. Nothing contained in these provisions is to be interpreted to prohibit the temporary exercise of incidence of ownership of stock in any corporation by persons or corporate fiduciaries not authorized to practice, solely for purposes of administering estates of shareholders deceased or under legal disability to transfer their shares. For purposes of this section, “temporary incidence of ownership” means any period of time not exceeding two (2) years; and “administering estates of shareholders” shall include, but not be limited to, contracting with licensed professionals to operate the practice upon the death of the person licensed to practice.

       Every professional service corporation shall maintain insurance against any liability imposed by law upon the corporation or its employees arising out of the performance of professional services, excluding liability for claims brought about or contributed to by the dishonest, fraudulent, criminal, or malicious acts or omissions of any employee. The insurance shall be maintained in a company lawfully authorized to write insurance in this state and shall be, with respect to each claim, in the aggregate amount of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) multiplied by the number of professional employees of the corporation as of the policy anniversary date. However, in no case is the coverage to be less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000). Not more than five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) coverage is to be required of any corporation.

The incorporators shall file the certificate in the office of the secretary of state at the time of filing the articles of association, and the secretary of state shall not certify the articles of association unless the certificate of insurance has been filed. Subsequently, every insurer shall notify the secretary of state and the insured of the termination of the insurance not more than thirty (30) days nor less than ten (10) days before the effective date of the termination. Upon receipt of the notice, the secretary of state shall inform the appropriate regulatory agency of the notice.

        Trial court judgment dismissing the complaint filed by shareholders against a corporation, its officers and directors, and an auction house, was upheld on appeal, because the action of the officers and directors in voting to sell a valuable folio of five prints was within their powers under the corporation’s bylaws and the shareholders had no proprietary interest in the sale. The shareholders failed to show any impropriety with regard to the bylaws and, therefore, their attempt to block the sale of the folio failed since the corporation’s action was not ultra vires.

As used in this section, “compensation” does not include a per diem or per meeting allowance, health insurance benefits, or reimbursement for out of pocket costs and expenses incurred in the service. Nothing in these provisions is construed to exempt a volunteer from liability based upon his or her ownership and/or operation of a motor vehicle.

        Trial court judgment dismissing the complaint filed by shareholders against a corporation, its officers and directors, and an auction house, was upheld on appeal because the action of the officers and directors in voting to sell a valuable folio of five prints was within their powers under the corporation’s bylaws and the shareholders had no proprietary interest in the sale. The shareholders failed to show any impropriety with regard to the bylaws and, therefore, their attempt to block the sale of the folio failed since the corporation’s action was not ultra vires.

       In proceedings to liquidate the assets and affairs of a corporation the court shall have the power to issue injunctions, to appoint a receiver or receivers pendente lite, with such powers and duties as the court directs, and to take such other proceedings as may be requisite to preserve the corporate assets wherever situated, and carry on the affairs of the corporation until a full hearing can be had.

      In proceedings to liquidate the assets and affairs of a corporation, the court may require all creditors of the corporation to file with the clerk of the court or with the receiver, in any form that the court prescribes, proofs under oath of their respective claims.

       Marketing contract — Enforcement.

     <p>
      The marketing contract of any association formed under this chapter may fix as liquidated damages, specific, reasonable sums to be paid by a member to the association upon the breach by him or her of any provisions of the marketing contract regarding the sale or delivery or withholding of products. It may also provide that the member will pay all costs, premiums for bonds, expenses, and fees in case any action is brought upon the contract by the association, and any provisions are valid and enforceable in the courts of this state. In the event of a breach, or threatened breach, of the marketing contract by a member, the board of directors may authorize one of the executive officers of the association to apply to the superior court for the counties of Providence and Bristol for an injunction to prevent the further breach of the contract and for a decree for the specific performance of the contract. Pending the adjudication of the petition, the court, upon the filing of a sufficient bond by the association, may grant any temporary relief that seems to it just and proper.

      At least once a year, the members and/or directors, as provided in the articles of association or bylaws, shall apportion the net savings of the association, after payment of return on capital, and after deduction of sums retained for proper corporate purposes, which may include an educational fund and a fund for the general welfare of the members, among member patrons, or to all patrons of the association in proportion to their patronage. However:

     <ol>

       Not less than ten percent (10%) shall be placed in a reserve fund until such time as the fund equals at least fifty percent (50%) of the paid-up capital, and the fund may be used in the general conduct of business.

      <li id="t07c08s7-8-26ol12">
       Sums allocated to subscribers and nonmembers as a result of the apportionment need not be paid in cash but may, if the articles of association or bylaws provide, be credited on the books of the association toward the payment of the minimum amount of share or membership capital subscribed for, or necessary for membership.

      A security may be registered in beneficiary form if the form is authorized by this or a similar statute of the state of organization of the issuer or registering entity, the location of the registering entity’s principal office, the office of its transfer agent or its office making the registration, or by this or a similar statute of the law of the state listed as the owner’s address at the time of registration. A registration governed by the law of a jurisdiction in which this, or similar legislation, is not in force or was not in force when a registration in beneficiary form was made is nevertheless presumed to be valid and authorized as a matter of contract law.

      On death of a sole owner or the last to die of all multiple owners, ownership of securities registered in beneficiary form passes to the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survive all owners. On proof of death of all owners and compliance with any applicable requirements of the registering entity, a security registered in beneficiary form may be reregistered in the name of the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survived the death of all owners. Until division of the security after the death of all owners, multiple beneficiaries surviving the death of all owners hold their interests as tenants in common. If no beneficiary survives the death of all owners, the security belongs to the estate of the deceased owner or the estate of the last to die of all multiple owners.

      A composition or compromise is not to be so construed as to discharge the other copartners, except as provided in §§ 7-12-5 and 7-12-6; nor does it impair the right of the creditor to proceed against the members of the copartnership who have not been discharged. The members of the partnership so proceeded against are permitted to set off any demand against the creditor that could have been set off had the suit been against all the individuals composing the firm. They may avail themselves of any defense that would have been available had not this chapter been passed, except that they shall not set up the discharge of one individual as a discharge of all the other copartners, unless it appears that all were intended to be discharged.

       Rules for determining the existence of a partnership.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In determining whether a partnership exists, these rules apply:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t07c12s7-12-18ol11">
       Except as provided by § 7-12-27, persons who are not partners as to each other are not partners as to third persons.
      </li>
      <li id="t07c12s7-12-18ol12">
       Joint tenancy, tenancy in common, tenancy by the entireties, joint property, common property, or part ownership does not of itself establish a partnership, whether the co-owners do or do not share any profits made by the use of the property.
      </li>
      <li id="t07c12s7-12-18ol13">
       The sharing of gross returns does not of itself establish a partnership, whether or not the persons sharing them have a joint or common right or interest in any property from which the returns are derived.
      </li>
      <li id="t07c12s7-12-18ol14">
       The receipt by a person of a share of the profits of a business is prima facie evidence that he or she is a partner in the business, but no such inference is drawn if profits were received in payment:
       <ol type="i">
        <li id="t07c12s7-12-18ol14-i">

        A partnership need not involve ownership of partnership property. The determining factor is whether two or more persons associate and share profits from a business. McAleer v. Smith,

        Although R.I. Gen. Laws § 7-12-18 specifies five instances in which profit sharing does not create a presumption of partnership formation, there is no authority for the proposition that the evidentiary presumption created by profit sharing can be overcome only by establishing these five exceptions, rather than by competent evidence of other pertinent factors indicating the absence of an intent to form a partnership such as lack of mutual control over business operations, failure to file partnership tax returns, or failure to prescribe loss-sharing.

        A mere marketing and commission arrangement between a vessel’s captain and its owners was insufficient to establish a partnership in a general maritime negligence action where the captain had no ownership interest in the vessel, did not share in the profits from the vessel’s operations, and had no control over the vessel’s assigned itinerary.

        No partnership existed between a professional show owner and producer and a builders’ association, even though the show owner and producer’s predecessors in interest had produced home shows for the builders’ association in Rhode Island for more than 20 years where, inter alia, (1) the agreement between the parties was not denoted as a “partnership agreement,” (2) the agreement prescribed a fixed, albeit renewable, term, (3) rather than undertake to share operating costs with the builders’ association, the show owner and producer not only agreed to advance all monies required to produce the shows, but to indemnify the builders’ association for all show-related losses as well, and (4) the show owner and producer was responsible for the lion’s share of the management decisions.

In addition, partnerships under this section shall provide the names and addresses of all resident partners, the place where the business records of the partnership are maintained, or if more than one location for business records is maintained, then the principal place of business of the partnership, number, a brief statement of the business in which the partnership engaged, and that the partnership applies for status, or renewal of its status, as a registered limited-liability partnership.

If the partnership agreement specified the manner of authorizing a conversion of the limited partnership, the conversion shall be authorized as specified in the partnership agreement. If the partnership agreement does not specify the manner of authorizing a conversion of the limited partnership and does not prohibit a conversion of the limited partnership, the conversion shall be authorized in the same manner as is specified in the partnership agreement for authorizing a merger or consolidation that involves the limited partnership as a constituent party to the merger or consolidation. If the partnership agreement does not specify the manner of authorizing a conversion of the limited partnership or a merger or consolidation that involved the limited partnership as a constituent party and does not prohibit a conversion of the limited partnership, the conversion shall be authorized by the approval (1) by all general partners, and (2) by the limited partners or, if there is more than one class or group of limited partners, then by each class or group of limited partners, in either case, by limited partners who own more than fifty percent (50%) of the then current percentage or other interest in the profits of the domestic limited partnership owned by all of the limited partners or by the limited partners in each class or group, as appropriate.

        Assignee who failed to file an Amendment to Partnership Agreement with the Office of the Secretary of State to transfer the legal title of the partnership interest, at most, holds an unperfected, unrecorded equitable interest (by way of assignment) in the general partnership interest. The trustee in bankruptcy, as a hypothetical bona fide purchaser of real property for value, without actual or constructive notice, takes title free from such unrecorded equitable interests. Although as between the original parties the transfer might be valid and enforceable, as against the trustee, the assignee’s interest in the partnership is clearly subordinate. WFC Realty Co. v.

      Except as provided in the partnership agreement, a partnership interest is assignable in whole or in part. An assignment of a partnership interest does not dissolve a limited partnership or entitle the assignee to become or to exercise any rights of a partner. An assignment entitles the assignee to receive, to the extent assigned, only the distribution to which the assignor would be entitled. Except as provided in the partnership agreement, a partner ceases to be a partner upon assignment of all his partnership interest.

The certificate of cancellation must include the post office address to which the secretary of state may mail a copy of any process against the foreign limited partnership that is served on the secretary of state.

      The superior court has jurisdiction to enjoin any foreign limited partnership, or any agent of a foreign limited partnership, from transacting any business in the state if the limited partnership has failed to comply with any section of this chapter applicable to it or if the limited partnership has secured a certificate of the secretary of state under § 7-13-49 on the basis of false or misleading representation. The attorney general may bring an action to restrain a foreign limited partnership from transacting business in this state in violation of this chapter.

       Title to all property forfeited pursuant to this chapter, except for that property awarded by the court to the victims of violations of the chapter pursuant to § 7-15-4(c), vests in the state of Rhode Island. There is established within the general treasury of the state a special fund to be known as the asset forfeiture fund in which shall be deposited all proceeds of any forfeitures. Where the forfeited property is a vessel, vehicle, aircraft, or other personal property the use of which reasonably relates to law enforcement duties, title to the property may be transferred to the law enforcement agency that seized it. Where the forfeited property is personal property the use of which is not reasonably related to law enforcement duties and where the forfeited property is real estate or an interest in real estate, it shall be sold under the direction of the general treasurer and the proceeds of the sale deposited in the asset forfeiture fund. Where the forfeited property consists of negotiable instruments, securities, or other intangible property, it shall be maintained by the general treasurer as part of the asset forfeiture fund and may be sold at his or her discretion and the proceeds deposited in the fund. Where the forfeited property consists of money, both coin and currency, it shall be deposited in the asset forfeiture fund.

         The payment of twenty-five percent (25%) of the net proceeds of a forfeiture to the Rhode Island law enforcement agency or agencies that accomplished the seizure to be used only for the purposes of future investigations of racketeering activity as defined in these provisions. No law enforcement agency of the state is entitled to keep more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) per calendar year under this section. No law enforcement agency of a city or town with a population in excess of twenty thousand (20,000) is entitled to keep more than thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000) per calendar year under this section. No law enforcement agency of a city or town with a population of twenty thousand (20,000) or less is entitled to keep more than fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) per calendar year under this section.

When the presiding justice, upon consideration of the reasons set forth by the agency, deems the funds to be reasonable and necessary to the accomplishment of a goal within the powers and duties of the law enforcement agency, he or she may issue an order ex parte providing for the release of the funds.

       Power to issue.  The power to issue investigative demands does not abate or terminate by reason of the bringing of any action or proceeding under this chapter. The attorney general may issue successive investigatory demands to the same person in order to obtain additional information pertinent to an ongoing investigation.
      </li>
      <li id="t07c15s7-15-7ol1c">
       Confidentiality.  In the event the attorney general initiates a civil investigatory demand prior to a criminal indictment for violation of this chapter, then the commencement, contents, and results of the civil investigatory demand is held in the strictest confidence by the attorney general and shall remain so until the time that a civil action is commenced, indictment for violation of this chapter returned, or removal of the confidentiality is ordered by a justice of the superior court.

Any person compelled to appear under a demand for oral testimony pursuant to this section may be accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel.

The person or counsel may object on the record to any question, in whole or in part, and shall briefly state for the record the reason for the objection. An objection may properly be made, received, and entered upon the record when it is claimed that the person is entitled to refuse to answer the question on grounds of any constitutional or other legal right or privilege, including the privilege against self incrimination. The person shall not otherwise object to or refuse to answer any question, and shall not by him or herself or through counsel interrupt the oral examination.

The time allowed for compliance with the demand in whole or in part as deemed proper and ordered by the court shall not run during the pendency of the petition in the court.

         Compelled testimony shall not be used against the witness as evidence in any criminal proceedings against him or her in any court. However, the grant of immunity does not immunize the witness from civil liability arising from the transactions about which testimony is given, and he or she may nevertheless be prosecuted or subjected to penalty or forfeiture for any perjury, false swearing, or contempt committed in answering or in failing to answer or in producing evidence or failing to do so in accordance with the order. If a person refuses to testify after being granted immunity from prosecution and after being ordered to testify, he or she may be adjudged in civil contempt by the superior court until any time that he or she purges him or herself of contempt by testifying, producing documentary material or presenting written answers as ordered. The above does not prevent the attorney general from instituting other appropriate contempt proceedings against any person who violates any of the above provisions.

       If the limited-liability company agreement specified the manner of authorizing a conversion of the limited-liability company, the conversion shall be authorized as specified in the limited-liability company agreement. If the limited-liability company agreement does not specify the manner of authorizing a conversion of the limited-liability company and does not prohibit a conversion of the limited-liability company, the conversion shall be authorized in the same manner as is specified in the limited-liability company agreement for authorizing a merger or consolidation that involves the limited-liability company as a constituent party to the merger or consolidation. If the limited-liability company agreement does not specify the manner of authorizing a conversion of the limited-liability company or a merger or consolidation that involves the limited-liability company as a constituent party and does not prohibit a conversion of the limited-liability company, the conversion shall be authorized by the approval by the members or, if there is more than one class or group of members, then by each class or group of members, in either case, by members who own more than fifty percent (50%) of the then-current percentage or other interest in the profits of the domestic limited-liability company owned by all of the members or by the members in each class or group, as appropriate.

When a limited-liability company has converted to another entity or business form pursuant to this section, for all purposes of the laws of the state of Rhode Island, the other entity or business form shall be deemed to be the same entity as the converting limited-liability company and conversion shall constitute a continuation of the existence of the limited-liability company in the form of such other entity or business form.
