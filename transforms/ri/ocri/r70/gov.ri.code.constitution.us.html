     <p>
      On February 21, 1787, Congress adopted a resolution in favor of a convention to devise provisions to render the Constitution of the federal government adequate to the exigencies of the union. Subsequently all of the original states except Rhode Island appointed delegates to the convention. The convention convened on May 25, 1787, and completed the proposed Constitution on September 17, 1787. On September 28, 1787, Congress ordered the Constitution submitted to conventions of the people of the various states.
     </p>
     <p>
      Rhode Island ratified the Constitution on May 29, 1790, and the President so notified Congress on June 1, 1790. The dates of ratification by the others of the original thirteen states were as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      Connecticut, January 9, 1788; Delaware, December 7, 1787; Georgia, January 2, 1788; Maryland, April 28, 1788; Massachusetts, February 6, 1788; New Hampshire, June 21, 1788; New Jersey, December 18, 1787; New York, July 26, 1788; North Carolina, November 21, 1789; Pennsylvania, December 12, 1787; South Carolina, May 23, 1788; Virginia, June 26, 1788.

      No person shall be a senator who shall not have attained to the age of thirty years, and been nine years a citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that state for which he shall be chosen.

      The senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments. When sitting for that purpose, they shall be on oath or affirmation.

     </h3>
     <p>
      All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the house of representatives; but the senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills.
     </p>
     <p>
      Every bill which shall have passed the house of representatives and the senate, shall, before it become a law, be presented to the president of the United States; if he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his objections to that house in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the objections at large on their journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such reconsideration two-thirds of that house shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent, together with the objections, to the other house, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered; and if approved by two-thirds of that house, it shall become a law. But in all such cases the votes of both houses shall be determined by yeas and nays, and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each house respectively. If any bill shall not be returned by the president within ten days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the same shall be a law; in like manner as if he had signed it, unless the congress by their adjournment prevent its return, in which case it shall not be a law.

     <p>
      Every order, resolution, or vote, to which the concurrence of the senate and house of representatives may be necessary (except on a question of adjournment) shall be presented to the president of the United States; and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two-thirds of the senate and house of representatives, according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill.

        The 1992 U.S. Sentencing Guidelines’ “one book” rule (which instructs the district court that when it looks to an earlier version of the Guidelines to calculate a sentence, it must apply all the Guidelines in that earlier version, and cannot apply one section from one edition and another guideline section from a different edition) did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, since by looking to the 1988 Guidelines, the district court imposed the very punishment provided for by law at the time the defendant committed the act for which he was being punished.

       § 1. The President.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The executive power shall be vested in a president of the United States of America. He shall hold his office during the term of four years, and, together with the vice-president, chosen for the same term, be elected as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      Each state shall appoint, in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct, a number of electors, equal to the whole number of senators and representatives to which the state may be entitled in the congress; but no senator or representative, or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States, shall be appointed an elector.
     </p>
     <p>
      The electors shall meet in their respective states, and vote by ballot for two persons, of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves. And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for, and of the number of votes for each; which list they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States, directed to the president of the senate. The president of the senate shall, in the presence of the senate and house of representatives, open all the certificates, and the votes shall then be counted. The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the president, if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed; and if there be more than one who have such majority, and have an equal number of votes, then the house of representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for president; and if no person have a majority, then from the five highest on the list the said house shall in like manner choose the president. But in choosing the president, the votes shall be taken by states, the representation from each state having one vote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two-thirds of the states, and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice. In every case, after the choice of the president, the person having the greatest number of votes of the electors shall be the vice-president. But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes, the senate shall choose from them by ballot the vice-president.
     </p>
     <p>
      The congress may determine the time of choosing the electors, and the day on which they shall give their votes; which day shall be the same throughout the United States.
     </p>
     <p>
      No person except a natural-born citizen, or a citizen of the United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the office of president; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty-five years, and been fourteen years a resident within the United States.
     </p>
     <p>
      In case of the removal of the president from office, or of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office, the same shall devolve on the vice-president, and the congress may by law provide for the case of removal, death, resignation or inability, both of the president and vice-president, declaring what officer shall then act as president, and such officer shall act accordingly, until the disability be removed, or a president shall be elected.
     </p>
     <p>
      The president shall, at stated times, receive for his services, a compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected; and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument from the United States, or any of them.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before he enters on the execution of his office, he shall take the following oath or affirmation:
     </p>
     <p>
      “I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of president of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”

Since the only duly licensed state HMO had not triggered these mandates nor evinced any intention of doing so, a complaint by a hospital service corporation and a medical service corporation which, together, sponsored an employee welfare benefit plan, challenging the validity of § 27-41-27 offered no “case or controversy” under the federal constitution.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Since eleventh amendment immunity can be waived, and since courts have the discretion to raise eleventh amendment questions
        sua sponte,
        suggests that the eleventh amendment is just as much a grant of immunity, and thus a type of defense, as it is a limitation on courts’ jurisdiction. Thus, there are eleventh amendment claims that are not jurisdictional and therefore need not be resolved before reaching the merits. Parella v. Retirement Bd. of the R.I. Employees' Retirement Sys.,

        Rhode Island statutes (former §§ 28-10-10, 28-10-12), making it a crime for an employer to utilize the services of a third party in recruiting or hiring workers to replace those who are engaged in a labor strike, have been preempted by the National Labor Relations Act and are therefore unconstitutional.

    The exclusion for religious organizations in § 28-42-8 does not manifest any governmental intent or purpose to advance or promote religion.

    Although high policy-making employees from whom the need for personal loyalty and confidence is great may permissibly be terminated for making statements which are otherwise protected by the first amendment, the manager of a decentralized unit of the institute of mental health was not such an employee, since he was charged only with implementing internally and externally imposed hospital policies, and did not enjoy a close working relationship with his superiors such that extraordinary intimacy or confidentiality were required; thus the manager’s criticisms of his superiors were protected under the first amendment.

    In a case involving the free speech rights of public employees, the court rejected a theory extending protection to expressions by such employees in public forums about matters of public interest, but denying protection to such expressions made in private to co-workers or superiors; for the right of free speech is designed to protect not only public debate, but intra-agency debates over policies and ideas as well.

    While the simple fact of a teacher’s termination eight months after a public controversy over a reading program in which the teacher publicly criticized a reduction in the program was not enough to show a violation of her constitutional right of free speech, the jury could have concluded that the superintendent and principal of the school retaliated against the teacher for her exercise of first amendment rights by ordering a termination they were without power to order, unjustifiably threatening another firing shortly after the school district reinstated the teacher, and then depriving her of a job to which she was entitled, and that such outrageous conduct supported a punitive damage award.

    The rigorousness of a court’s inquiry into the propriety of a state election law depends upon the extent to which a challenged regulation burdens First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. When the right to vote is subjected to severe restrictions, the regulation must be narrowly drawn to advance a state interest of compelling importance; when the state law imposes only reasonable restrictions upon the rights of voters, the state’s important regulatory interests are generally sufficient to justify the restrictions.

    In attempting to ascertain whether a person was arrested at a given time, the court looks to several factors, including the following: The extent to which the person’s freedom of movement has been curtailed and the degree of force used by the police, the belief of a reasonable innocent person in the same circumstances, and whether the person had the option of not going with the police.

    A person is seized or under arrest for Fourth Amendment purposes if, in view of all the circumstances, a reasonable person would believe that he or she was not free to leave. In making this determination, a court may consider the following factors: (1) the extent to which the person’s freedom is curtailed; (2) the degree of force employed by the police; (3) the belief of a reasonable, innocent person in identical circumstances; and (4) whether the person had the option of not accompanying the police.

    It was not error to deny defendant’s motion to suppress defendant’s inculpatory statements to a police officer because defendant was not in custody when defendant made the statements, as nothing showed defendant’s freedom of movement was curtailed or that the officer used force that would make a reasonable person think the person was not free to leave.

    There was insufficient evidence to show that sufficiently exigent circumstances were present so as to justify defendant’s warrantless arrest.

    Claimant’s assault-and-battery claim against the police officers who arrested the claimant was not fit for resolution by summary judgment; although scant, the evidence raised a genuine dispute as to the propriety of the officers’ use of force, if such force in fact was used. A reasonable jury could have accepted the claimant’s account over the contradictory narrative provided by an arresting officer and inferred that the level of force applied by the officers was excessive under the circumstances.

    Ample evidence that probable cause existed for defendant’s arrest existed where the patrolman was a police officer with ten years of experience and training; he was signaled to stop his vehicle while patrolling the area in which the victim was murdered. After speaking with witnesses, he immediately parked his patrol car on the street in front of the steps leading to the park; upon entering the park, he observed defendant leaning over the victim’s body with both hands on her chest; the patrolman saw no one else in the area; the victim was observed bleeding profusely from the neck, her body still warm; the defendant’s arms, hands, and clothing were covered with blood; the patrolman also saw a pair of men’s pants on a park bench in close proximity to the victim; and broken glass was observed on the bench, on the victim’s body and all about the surrounding area.

    A particularized suspicion was justifiably raised in the minds of the arresting officers that the defendant was engaged in or was about to engage in wrongdoing since the defendant, a passenger in a speeding vehicle in which the driver was unable to produce either a driver’s license or the vehicle’s registration, was fidgeting, looking away, and when after exiting the vehicle, the defendant shied away from the officer on one side.

    The Supreme Court has set forth a two-step test for determining whether a reasonable expectation of privacy exists: whether the individual has exhibited a subjective expectation and whether such subjective expectation, viewed objectively, is justifiable under the circumstances.

    There was insufficient evidence to show that defendant’s mother’s signing of the consent to search form for their home was free and voluntary where numerous armed officers had entered her home at 7 a.m. looking for her son, whom they arrested, and there were still several officers in the home when she was asked to provide her written consent.

    Trial court erred by finding that defendant’s consent to the search of his bedroom after his illegal warrantless arrest was voluntary where he was still sitting in the back of the police cruiser immediately after having experienced the illegal entry into his residence by several police officers who immediately arrested him early on that Sunday morning, and there were no intervening circumstances that would lead to the determination that defendant’s consent was sufficiently attenuated from his illegal arrest so as to be untainted by the preceding illegal police activity.

    In the context of both the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, evidence derived from sources separate from a constitutional violation need not be suppressed under the exclusionary rule. The question as to whether the inevitable discovery exception is available arises after there has been a determination that an accused’s constitutional rights have been violated; when the evidence sought to be suppressed would inevitably have been discovered without reference to the police error or misconduct, there is no nexus sufficient to provide a taint and the evidence is admissible.

    In order to determine on the facts whether or not statements made by defendent while in detention following an illegal arrest were obtained by exploitation of the illegal arrest, the Supreme Court must consider (1) the temporal proximity of the arrest and the confession, (2) the presence of intervening circumstances, and (3) particularly the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct. State v. Burns,
    <cite class="ocri">

    Where defendant’s confession was obtained while defendant was being detained as the result of an illegal arrest, the state not only had the initial burden of showing that defendant’s statements met the voluntariness standards required by the Fifth Amendment but also has the burden of demonstrating that the causal connection between the statements and the illegal arrest was broken so as to dispel the primary taint of the illegal seizure. State v. Burns,

   <p>
    Where defendant made his statements some six to eight hours after he was taken into custody following his illegal arrest but was never allowed outside the interrogation area the whole time he was being detained, there was no intervening event of significance sufficient to break the connection between the illegal arrest and the statements made. State v. Burns,

    A finding that a confession may satisfy the voluntariness standards of the Fifth Amendment does not necessarily mean that there is no Fourth Amendment violation. State v. Jennings,

    Where the defendant’s sudden willingness to incriminate himself was the result of his being confronted with illegally seized evidence indicating his guilt, the confession was obtained by the exploitation of the illegal search and seizure and was therefore inadmissible. State v. Jennings,

    Where the Supreme Court must conclude as a matter of fact that defendent was brought involuntarily to the police station for interrogation even though the police did not suspect him and had no probable cause to believe that he was guilty of a crime, the trial justice’s finding that his statements were involuntary for Fifth Amendment purposes was insufficient to overcome the Fourth Amendment violation.

    Evidence obtained as a result of a search incident to a lawful arrest is legally competent and therefore admissible to support the conviction of a defendant.

   <p>
    The right of the police to search areas into which the arrestee may be expected to move, as well as the search of articles to be handed to the arrestee, is well settled when the movement or other acts are performed at the request of the arrestee. In that situation a limited search for weapons is reasonable. State v. Robalewski,

    Although many courts have recognized the right of the police to conduct a quick and cursory check of a residence when they have reasonable grounds to believe there are other persons present who might present a security risk, the purpose of this type of search is to check for persons, not things; and the search is justified only when it is necessary to allow the police to ascertain the presence of anyone who might threaten their safety or destroy evidence.

    Where a constitutional violation is claimed resulting from a drug seizure following a patdown search for weapons after a traffic stop, the court should suppress the evidence if the officer negated the presence of an obvious weapon on the defendant’s person before he determined that the felt object was contraband, but not if he determined it was contraband before or simultaneous with negating the presence of a weapon.

    A two-pronged test has been articulated by the United States Supreme Court for determining whether an investigatory stop is permissible. First, the assessment of the situation must be based upon all the circumstances, including objective observations, information from police reports, and consideration of the patterns of operation of certain kinds of lawbreakers. From this data, a trained officer may draw inferences based upon his knowledge and experience. Second, this process must raise a suspicion that the particular individual being stopped is engaged in wrongdoing. In re John N.,

    Since police officers were informed at roll call of drug activity occurring at a certain address, since they later observed the defendant and another person leaving that location at two o’clock in the morning, since the defendant’s companion dropped two bags of cocaine before they could be asked what they were doing in the area, and since the defendant attempted to leave the scene while his companion was being arrested, a trained and experienced law enforcement officer had reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, justifying an investigatory stop.

    Defendant’s motion to suppress was properly denied because the investigating stop and subsequent search of the van conducted by the police before defendant was arrested were constitutionally proper and justified; the officers had more than an articulable suspicion that defendant had traveled to another city to purchase drugs, and an anonymous tip was sufficiently detailed, and thereafter corroborated, to warrant an experienced detective to become reasonably suspicious of defendant’s behavior.

     — “Knock and Announce” Requirement.
    </b>
   </h5>
   <p>
    Sole fact that search was for easily destructible narcotics did not justify unannounced entry in violation of common-law “knock and announce” where defendant had no criminal record, officer was not refused admittance, no drugs were destroyed and no other evidence justified unannounced entry in violation of the Fourth Amendment as applied by the Fourteenth Amendment.

    An officer must first knock and announce his identity and purpose and wait a reasonable period of time before breaking into and entering premises to execute an arrest warrant. State v. Sundel,

   <p>
    The knock and announce requirement is limited by certain qualifications and exceptions that apply under exigent circumstances. A no-knock search may be sustained, where the police, based on previous information and certain events at the scene, are confronted with an emergency situation, when approaching the premises. Thus the officer executing the warrant need not knock and announce himself when to do so would lead to the destruction of the evidence or increase the danger to the officer’s personal safety, where persons will escape and where it is evident that the officer’s purpose is known to those against whom the warrant is directed.

    Waiting five to ten seconds after an officer knocks and announces “police” before the officer forces his way into a house for which a search warrant is issued, is reasonable, where the warrant is executed at approximately 9:30 p.m., and knocking on the front door continues and remains unanswered before the officer knocks on the back door and then forces his way in.

    The knock-and-announce requirement mandates that an officer must first knock and announce his or her identity and purpose and wait a reasonable length of time before he or she may break and enter into the premises to be searched. However, not every entry by police needs to be preceded by an announcement. A ruse may be necessary in order to preserve the police officer’s personal safety and to prevent the destruction of evidence by announcing police presence. State v. Mastracchio,

    The fourth amendment allows a police officer with reasonable suspicion to slightly lean into an open car window and shine a flashlight into the vehicle to follow the occupant’s hands, so that a hand-gun seized in plain view was properly admitted into evidence. State v. Aubin,

    Where, while conducting a general search, police officers, relying on the plain-view doctrine, seized a magazine found on the defendant’s nightstand, which included an article describing the inside world of the drug trade and the challenges of stopping drug trafficking, as well as a police scanner and radio guide, in light of the accusation that the defendant was involved in drug trafficking, it was reasonable for the officers to suspect that these otherwise unincriminating objects were assisting defendant in avoiding police detection while carrying on illicit trades. Thus, the items were properly seized under the plain-view doctrine. State v. Pratt,

    Since a police officer’s presence at a residence was lawful because he was investigating a burglar alarm, and since the sight of a caged raccoon in plain view would have given him probable cause to believe that the animal was evidence or contraband, a two hour delay to check the raccoon’s license and to locate environmental management officers was reasonable, and no constitutional violation occurred.

    Courts should treat with preference the drawing of inferences by a judicial officer on the basis of facts set forth in an affidavit in support of an application for a search warrant. In doubtful cases, preference must always be given to the use of warrants in order not to discourage police officers from submitting their evidence to a judicial officer before acting. State v. Read,

    Although a court determining the existence of probable cause must view the circumstances in the context of the factual and practical considerations of everyday life, probable cause to arrest one person does not in itself constitute probable cause to arrest and search everyone else present or associating with the first individual. State v. Firth,

    Probable cause exists when the facts and circumstances known by the officers and of which they have reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that an offense is being or has been committed and that the defendant has committed it. The arresting officer in the field is entitled to rely on the departmental knowledge that comes to him through official channels. State v. Firth,

    One of the most important elements in determining whether probable cause existed is satisfied when the police know a crime has actually been committed. State v. Frazier,

    When the arrest or search is made when the police do not know that a crime has been committed, more and better evidence is needed to prove that probable cause exists for the arrest than is the case when the police do know that a crime has been committed. State v. Frazier,

    While a reasonable suspicion might justify a brief investigatory stop of an individual to determine his identity or momentarily to maintain the status quo, probable cause remains a prerequisite to an arrest. State v. Frazier,

    The crucial issue is whether at the moment of the arrest the facts and circumstances within the police officer’s knowledge and of which he had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent person’s believing that the arrestee had committed or was committing an offense.

    A search warrant may not be challenged as issued without probable cause merely because one or more of the persons toward whom the probable cause pointed turned out ultimately to be innocent: any contrary rule would require the evidentiary support necessary for probable cause to rise to the level of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

    Where the affidavit submitted in support of an apartment search warrant described the defendant’s purchase of approximately 29 pounds of marijuana and the subsequent forfeiture of approximately 26 pounds by an undercover officer to the police department, and where the affidavit further expressed the police department’s belief that the defendant “had given or sold those (missing) three pounds to person or persons unknown”, because the affidavit was devoid of any facts or other evidence to support the conclusion that the defendant had actually sold the marijuana, the issuing magistrate could reasonably conclude that the defendant had not sold or given away the drugs, but in fact still possessed them in his home.

    Based on experience in narcotics, a surveillance detective determined that a suspected drug transaction had taken place between defendant and a buyer. He seized a bag suspected to be cocaine, and then relayed the information via police radio to an arresting detective who was told the location of defendant and a description of his vehicle. When the arresting officer responded to the call within minutes of the suspected drug deal, defendant’s car was still parked in the exact spot the first detective had described. The information the arresting officer received through official channels had the requisite probable cause to arrest defendant, thus, the arrest was lawful; accordingly, defendant’s extemporaneous statements were not fruits of a poisonous tree, and defendant’s motion to suppress his statements was properly denied.

    Defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the text messages exchanged between himself and his girlfriend contained in her cell phone, and therefore he had no standing to challenge the search and seizure of her phone, because he had no control over who could view or access the text messages having already sent the incriminating text messages. The phone was used exclusively by the girlfriend and defendant exhibited no dominion or control over it, nor did he attempt to exclude others from accessing the phone. State v. Patino,

    A warrant describing the property and articles to be searched for as “any and all evidence of breaking and entering of dwellings, and possession of stolen goods, to include, but not limited to, jewelry, coins, collectors’ items, electronic equipment, etc.” was adequate and sufficiently descriptive given the urgent circumstances, since the defendant, who had been taken into custody during the afternoon, was likely to be released on bail or recognizance within a short time of his arrest, thus necessitating the request for authorization to execute the warrant during the nighttime.

    An affidavit was not invalid for failure to particularly describe the premises to be searched, where the allegations in the affidavit amply supported the inference drawn by the issuing justice that the entire dwelling unit and both occupants were involved in the storage of stolen drugs, and the issuing justice could infer on the basis of ordinary experience in the facts of life that a person engaged in the storage of a great quantity of stolen narcotics and related substances would not place it in a portion of a single-family dwelling house without having first taken the precaution of making a confederate of his tenant; in drawing these inferences from the affidavit, the justice was following the principal that affidavits for search warrants must be tested and interpreted by magistrates and courts in a common sense and realistic fashion.

    Although the DEA agent had extensive training and expertise, her statements in the affidavit supporting the search warrant simply provided only generalized information regarding how drug traffickers operate; thus, the totality of the circumstances, as summarized within the four corners of the affidavit, did not give rise to a fair probability that the search of the particular location that the agent only presumed to be the suspected trafficker’s residence would uncover contraband.

    In a child pornography case in which the named subscriber of an IP address did not reside at the address listed in the warrant, nothing within the affidavit rose to the level of a knowing or intelligent false statement or one made with reckless disregard for the truth as the police were able to make a direct connection between the device using that IP address, the physical address listed in the warrant, and the downloaded child pornography; and, even if the name of the subscriber listed in the warrant affidavit was disregarded, there was probable cause for the search warrant, considering the information regarding the IP address, and the detective’s surveillance of the physical address.

    The warrant in this case was fatally flawed because it authorized the police to conduct a blanket or general search of the entire 12 acre, 18 building, 10 warehouse, 83 separate unit business complex, rented to at least 30 different tenants, and thus the evidence seized must be excluded.

    When considering whether facts alleged in a search warrant affidavit established probable cause to issue a warrant, the fact that the affidavit omitted that another person, other than defendant, lived in the house to be searched was not significant because (1) the house was a single-family home, and (2) nothing showed defendant did not control the entire house.

   <p>
    Because of the importance of Fourth Amendment freedoms to every American, and because of the fact-specific nature of the probable cause inquiry, the government’s contention that a controlled buy of contraband should be
    per se
    sufficient to establish probable cause for a search warrant is rejected. United States v. Khounsavanh,

    Requisite nexus between contraband described in a search warrant affidavit and the place to be searched need not be based on direct observation of the suspect with the contraband at or near the area to be searched. Rather, it may be found in the type of crime, the nature of the items sought, the extent of the suspect’s opportunity for concealment, and normal inferences as to where a criminal would be likely to hide items of the sort sought in the warrant.

    As a reasonable inference could be drawn from the facts alleged in a detective’s affidavit that defendant would take home the easily transportable digital camera he used to take photos beneath a child’s skirt, a warrant to search defendant’s home for cameras was supported by probable cause under U.S. Const. amend. IV and R.I. Const. art. I, § 6. State v. Byrne,

    Search warrant affidavit established probable cause to issue a search warrant for defendant’s residence, under the totality-of-the-circumstances test, because the confluence of an anonymous tip, twelve cut plastic baggies from defendant’s trash, cocaine residue on one baggie, defendant’s non-drug-related criminal history, and inferences therefrom showed a “fair probability” that drugs and indicia of drug distribution would be found at the residence. State v. Storey,

   <p>
    It was not error for an affidavit seeking the issuance of a warrant to search for drugs and indicia of drug distribution to describe defendant’s history of non-drug-related criminal activity because such activity was part of the totality of the circumstances considered in determining whether to issue a warrant. State v. Storey,

    Two-month-old tip relied on to obtain a warrant to search defendant’s residence was not stale because trash seized from the residence shortly before the warrant was issued refreshed the tip, as evidence found in the trash was directly consistent with the tip. State v. Storey,

   <p>
    When considering whether facts alleged in a search warrant affidavit established probable cause to issue a warrant, the fact that the affidavit alleged that cocaine residue was found on only one of twelve cut baggies found in defendant’s trash, which was consistent with personal use rather than distribution, was insignificant because the affidavit sought the issuance of a warrant to search for the presence of illegal narcotics, as well as any indicia of drug distribution. State v. Storey,

    Totality of the circumstances presented in an affidavit in support of a search warrant allowed the magistrate to reasonably infer that drugs would be found in defendant’s apartment, as the affiant stated that a confidential informant reported the sale of cocaine by a black male from an apartment, and police determined that defendant was that male and lived in that apartment.

    (R.I. 2012).
   </p>
   <p>
    Defendant’s motion to suppress evidence seized from his residence was properly denied, as a confidential informant’s tip that he was selling drugs from his apartment was corroborated, and this corroborated tip, combined with defendant’s recent sale of cocaine in a controlled buy, satisfied the probable cause requirement to support the search warrant.

    Respondent juvenile’s motion to suppress was properly denied because the warrant was based on probable cause as the warrant application listed the correct IP address that was suspected of involvement with child pornography and the correct physical address linked to that IP address; and the fact that the named subscriber did not reside at the physical address listed in the warrant did not invalidate the warrant.

    Since law enforcement officers’ relevant knowledge regarding a raccoon being kept as a pet in a residence was complete almost two hours before environmental management officers arrived to seize the animal, and since the officers on the scene were not motivated by an objective or subjective belief that the animal would be spirited away or that it was imminently dangerous, there were no exigent circumstances justifying an exception to the warrant requirement.

    Where the police could have obtained a search warrant for evidence whose discovery they fully anticipated, under circumstances which indicated that no intolerable delay would have been required, the talisman excuse of police safety did not justify their excursion beyond the scope of activity necessary to effect the defendant’s arrest, and a search warrant based on their observations was likewise invalid.

    The prohibition of this amendment is not against being twice punished, but against being twice put in jeopardy, and the accused whether convicted or acquitted, is equally put in jeopardy after trial on the first offense. United States v. Ball,

    Where sentence of petitioner was to begin after expiration of prior sentence he was then erroneously thought to be serving and it was later discovered that he was not serving a prior sentence, a correction of the sentence four days later, when he was again brought before the court, did not constitute two sentences on one indictment and was not a violation of his constitutional rights under this provision.

    Where defendants indicted for rape, kidnapping, sodomy and larceny pled nolo contendere pursuant to a plea bargain which provided for sentences on all four charges, and where trial judge first accepted, then revoked, the plea bargain and reinstated the not guilty pleas upon which the jury returned a verdict of not guilty of rape and kidnapping with sentences greater than those originally agreed upon in the plea bargain, upon remand by the supreme court with instructions to resentence in accordance with the original bargain, the sentencing judge could not impose the agreed-upon sentences for sodomy and larceny since defendants had been acquitted for those charges by the jury and to do so would violate the double jeopardy prohibitions of the Constitution.

    To determine whether a defendant being tried for the violation of two distinct statutory provisions which arose from the same act or transaction is being placed twice in jeopardy, the test to be applied is whether each statutory provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.

    Where appellants themselves have pressed for a mistrial, the double jeopardy clause bars a new trial only if it can be said that the government’s claimed error stemmed from bad faith, an effort to harrass or prejudice, or an attempt to provoke a mistrial. United States v. Zozlio,

    A new information which was prompted by evidence developed a trial prior to a declaration of mistrial and which increased the potential for conviction could not be imposed in lieu of the original indictment, as it would have victimized the defendant significantly for having successfully pursued a legitmate trial tactic.

    When the same act or transaction constitutes the violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the applicable standard is found in Blockburger v. United States,

    When the meaning of a criminal statute is ambiguous, the policy of lenity in the construction of criminal statutes requires that the less harsh of two possible meanings be adopted. Its purpose is to prevent the pyramiding of sentences when the penalties have not been clearly authorized. State v. Anthony,

    The standard used for determining whether an accused is in danger of being twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense is that set forth by the United States Supreme Court in Blockburger v. United States,
    <cite class="ocri">
     284 U.S. 299
    </cite>
    ,
    <cite class="ocri">

    </cite>
    ,
    <cite class="ocri">
     76 L. Ed. 306

    (1932), wherein the supreme court held that: “the applicable rule is that where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.” State v. Ballard,
    <cite class="ocri">
     439 A.2d 1375
    </cite>
    ,
    <cite class="ocri">
     1982 R.I. LEXIS 796
    </cite>
    (R.I. 1982).
   </p>
   <p>
    Ordinarily, when a mistrial is granted on the defendant’s motion or with his consent the principal of double jeopardy does not bar a subsequent prosecution. State v. Sundel,
    <cite class="ocri">
     460 A.2d 939
    </cite>
    ,
    <cite class="ocri">
     1983 R.I. LEXIS 954
    </cite>
    (R.I. 1983).
   </p>
   <p>
    Double jeopardy did not bar defendant’s retrial for second-degree murder after the Supreme Court had sustained his appeal on the ground that a mistrial should have been awarded, where the prosecutor had not intended to bring about a mistrial, even though his conduct gave rise to a situation in which a mistrial should properly have been granted. State v. Diaz,
    <cite class="ocri">
     521 A.2d 129
    </cite>
    ,
    <cite class="ocri">
     1987 R.I. LEXIS 418
    </cite>
    (R.I. 1987).
   </p>
   <p>
    Where the granting of a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal did not terminate the prosecution’s case, was never communicated to the jury which remained impaneled, and only had the effect of reducing certain charges; the granting of the motion had no effect on the continuance of the trial and submission of the case to the jury which remained impaneled, and the defendant was not faced with the threat of reprosecution in violation of double jeopardy. State v. Iovino,
    <cite class="ocri">
     524 A.2d 556
    </cite>
    ,
    <cite class="ocri">
     1987 R.I. LEXIS 449
    </cite>
    (R.I. 1987).
   </p>
   <p>
    Where the defendant apparently sought to promote the trial’s progression by attempting to resolve the controversy surrounding his request for his wife to assist with communication at counsel table, his failure to arrange for an interpreter, even if engendering a concern for the effectiveness of counsel and serving as a catalyst for the declaration of mistrial, cannot be construed as a request for or consent to mistrial, nor can his failure to object after the trial justice’s abrupt and unanticipated declaration of mistrial be viewed as acquiesence in the ruling. Accordingly, the mistrial cannot be said to have been declared at defendant’s behest. State v. Torres,
    <cite class="ocri">
     524 A.2d 1120
    </cite>
    ,
    <cite class="ocri">
     1987 R.I. LEXIS 473
    </cite>
    (R.I. 1987).
   </p>
   <p>
    The manifest-necessity standard is the proper measure of double-jeopardy protection that must be extended to a defendant absent the defendant’s request or consent, even though the trial justice, in declaring the mistrial, was motivated by desire to protect the defendant’s rights and was therefore, in effect, conferring a benefit upon the defendant. State v. Torres,
    <cite class="ocri">
     524 A.2d 1120
    </cite>
    ,
    <cite class="ocri">
     1987 R.I. LEXIS 473
    </cite>
    (R.I. 1987).
   </p>
   <p>
    The Double Jeopardy Clause embodies three distinct safeguards for one accused of a crime. First, it protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal. Second, it protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction. Third, it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense. United States v. Abreu,
    <cite class="ocri">
     952 F.2d 1458

    Where the trial justice labored under three concerns before declaring the mistrial: Judicial economy, defendant’s potential communication problem, and absence of a prosecution witness, none of these concerns manifestly required the mistrial, since the potential length of any continuance that might be required to resolve the problems at hand did not warrant the jury’s dismissal, the communication problem was resolved with a continuance that merely extended from midpoint in the court’s afternoon session to the next morning, a loss of only a few hours, the record was devoid of any indication that the witness problem required a continuance, given that the prosecution had other witnesses to call, or if it did require a continuance, that the continuance would be lengthy, and the reason for the witness’s absence was minor and on its face easily resolvable within a brief period.

   </h5>
   <p>
    Where the judge erroneously revokes counsel’s permission to appear, then asks the defendant whether he wishes to proceed, represent himself, or obtain other counsel, and the defendant says he would like to engage other counsel, the judge may then take the case from the jury and set a new trial date. The new trial does not violate the protection against double jeopardy provided by this amendment. The important consideration, for purposes of the double jeopardy clause, is that the defendant retain primary control over the course to be followed after a serious trial court error, and unless the judge’s action is motivated by bad faith or undertaken to harass or prejudice the defendant, the double jeopardy clause does not prevent a retrial as long as the defendant is offered the choice of continuing.

    Where the prosecution inadvertently failed to disclose relevant information to the defendants and the trial judge granted a mistrial after finding that manifest necessity had been established, the motion justice who denied the defendant’s motion to dismiss the retrial on double jeopardy grounds properly found that the trial justice acted out of manifest necessity given that the proceeding at best would have produced a verdict that could have been upset at will by one of the parties.

    Since the trial justice, in granting a new trial for the defendant convicted of assault with intent to commit sexual assault, specifically assessed the credibility of the witnesses and determined that he did not believe certain witnesses who claimed that the defendant was essentially sober and was thus capable of forming a specific intent, the justice was acting as a thirteenth juror. The justice did not determine that the evidence was legally insufficient, as would have been the case had he granted a judgment of acquittal. Therefore, double jeopardy principles did not bar a second trial. State v. Laperche,

    Although first-degree murder and second-degree murder constitute the “same offense” under Rhode Island law, the defendant’s retrial for second-degree murder, the lesser-included offense, following his acquittal on the charge of first-degree murder, did not violate his constitutional rights against double jeopardy, since first-degree murder also requires proof of premeditation of more than a momentary duration and proof of deliberation, whereas second-degree murder does not, thus satisfying the applicable “same evidence” test.

    Retrial on the charge of kidnapping did not violate double jeopardy, as there was not abuse of discretion by the trial judge when he determined that the jury was “genuinely deadlocked” after he had made a prudent examination of the jury’s progress, provided supplemental instructions, and requested that the jurors return to deliberations for a reasonable period.

    (b), would force him to relitigate issues already decided by a valid judgment of acquittal, but defendant did not argue that the jury in the first trial necessarily decided the ultimate issue in count five, one of the first-degree sexual assault counts, which resulted in a deadlocked jury and was the only count for which the State sought a retrial; and his argument that admitting the acquitted conduct into evidence would force defendant to relitigate those same issues already decided by a valid judgment of acquittal conflated a double jeopardy contention with one that was evidentiary.

    Even if the filing of a notice of lis pendens constituted a taking with sufficient state involvement, the Rhode Island lis pendens procedure provides adequate constitutional safeguards since it specifies that a plaintiff shall give notice to all named parties within seven days after recording a notice of lis pendens, and a defendant may subsequently file a motion to quash an improperly filed lis pendens; there is no constitutional requirement that the landowner be given a hearing before the notice of lis pendens is filed.

The question as to whether the inevitable-discovery exception is available arises after there has been a determination that an accused’s constitutional rights have been violated; when the evidence sought to be suppressed would inevitably have been discovered without reference to the police error or misconduct, there is no nexus sufficient to provide a taint and the evidence is admissible.

    Two categories of outrageous misconduct cases exist: (1) those in which the government is an active participant in the crime, and (2) those involving the subversion of a defendant’s attorney to prosecute that defendant. Defendant was not entitled to the defense of outrageous government conduct in a situation where the State brokered an agreement with an attorney to grant transactional immunity to a witness in exchange for information leading to defendant’s arrest and indictment despite the fact that the attorney later represented defendant in the same matter; since the attorney was not in a client relationship with defendant when the agreement with the witness was brokered and since it was the witness and not the attorney who gave the government information, the government committed no misconduct and did not interfere with defendant’s attorney-client relationship.

    If a substantive due process violation is to be found in the practice of detention pending deportation, it can only be based upon a finding that the detention, under a particular set of factual circumstances, is excessive in relation to the governmental purposes behind the restriction.

    Because the plaintiff’s fifth amendment substantive due process claim in his habeas corpus petition did not implicate the adequacy of the procedures afforded him by the federal immigration statute or the validity of the decision of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in applying the provisions of that statute, he was not statutorily required to exhaust his administrative remedies prior to seeking judicial relief.

    Since there existed the potential for many more years of detention while awaiting the occurrence of the remote possibility of deportation, due to the refusal of the potential country of destination to accept the deportee, and since the danger posed by the deportee was of the milder sort, in that his convictions were for purse-snatching and low-level narcotics violations, the continued physical detention of the deportee in a prison pending deportation was excessive in relation to the governmental objectives that regulatory detention sought to advance.

    Although it is true that the privilege against self-incrimination should be upheld if the answer to a question would create a link in a chain of evidence which might be utilized in order to prosecute the witness for criminal conduct, it is necessary that the trial justice make a determination of whether relevant questions could have a reasonable possibility of establishing the hazard of incrimination.

    Once it is clear from the implications of the question in the setting in which it is asked that a responsive answer to the question or an explanation why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because an injurious disclosure could result, it is the duty of the court to refrain from placing upon the witness the burden of establishing the incriminatory nature of responses to the question by making disclosures that in themselves would be incriminatory.

    Prosecutor’s statement during closing argument that a government theory had gone uncontested in cross-examination came “perilously close” to commenting on defendant’s failure to testify on his own behalf, since defendant was the only witness whose testimony could have refuted the theory; however, the prosecutor’s remarks fell short of reversible error because they were limited to the failure of defense to refute government arguments in cross-examination, and because the trial judge issued appropriate instructions.

    The trial justice’s comments to defense counsel regarding the defendant’s failure to testify were a candid assessment that the defendant’s admissions of guilt, brought out through the state’s witnesses, remained uncontradicted except for any inconsistencies that could be found in the witnesses’ testimony.

    Prosecutor’s statement that there was no evidence before the jury that the sex was consensual, including none from defendant, taken in context, did not violate defendant’s Fifth Amendment rights as the prosecutor’s comment did not implicate defendant’s right to remain silent. Given the broader context of the comment, the prosecutor’s statement was not of such a character that a jury would naturally and necessarily have construed it to amount to a comment on the failure of the accused to testify; further, the portion of the general instructions pertaining to defendant’s right not to testify adequately expressed that he had every right to remain silent, and admonished that such a choice could not be held against him.

    Where a murder suspect who struck all who observed him as highly intelligent reserved as many as six Miranda cautions during the period in which he was giving statements to police, and executed waivers after each caution, there was no question that he was eager to talk about what he had done, and that his statements, like the waivers, were voluntary and admissible.

    It was not error to deny defendant’s motion to suppress defendant’s confession made during an interrogation at a police station because it was not clear error to find the confession was made after defendant voluntarily waived defendant’s Miranda rights, as (1) defendant’s counsel admitted defendant was not forced to make the confession, (2) the evidence was undisputed that defendant was not threatened, defendant never said defendant was confused or felt pressured, defendant never asked to stop questioning, and defendant never requested an attorney, and (3) any limits on defendant’s understanding of English had little bearing on the validity of defendant’s Miranda waiver, as defendant was advised of those rights in defendant’s first language.

    The Miranda safeguards come into play whenever a person in custody is subjected to either express questioning or its functional equivalent; that is, the term “interrogation” under Miranda refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating reponse from the suspect.

    There was no “interrogation” within the meaning of Miranda where police officers transporting an arrested defendant to the station conversed briefly among themselves but within the defendant’s hearing about the need to find the murder weapon, believed to be located in the vicinity of a school for handicapped children; the fact that the officers’ comments struck a responsive chord in the defendant, who then located the shotgun for the police, did not decide the matter where it was not established that the police should have known that their words were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.

    The right against self-incrimination is personal; it cannot be invoked or waived by anyone other than the person to whom the right attaches. Therefore, even if police conduct infringes on an existing attorney-client relationship, it cannot violate the accused’s fifth amendment right not to incriminate himself unless the conduct itself somehow affects the accused’s capacity to invoke his rights.

    In determining whether to admit inculpatory statements allegedly obtained in violation of constitutional guarantees, the trial justice must first conduct a preliminary hearing out of the jury’s presence in which the state must show by clear and convincing evidence that the statements were obtained in a constitutional manner; and, if the trial justice admits the evidence, he must specifically instruct the jury that, before it may consider the evidence, it must first determine beyond any reasonable doubt that the inculpatory statements were not obtained in violation of the defendant’s constitutional guarantees.

    Since no constitutional infraction automatically takes place when the police question a suspect who they have reason to know is represented by counsel, none ipso facto occurs merely because of neglect to inform the suspect of an attempt by an attorney to contact him. Rather, the relationship of the suspect to the attorney, the extent of the knowledge enjoyed by the authorities, the nature of the lawyer’s request, and all kindred factors, become part and parcel of the “totality of the circumstances” which must in all events be sifted and weighed in determining whether or not a free and sentient waiver of the rights to remain silent and to the presence of an attorney has been effectuated.

    Defendant’s prior involvement in the criminal justice system was “telling evidence” that the constitutional warnings given him by the police were understood and that his waiver was knowingly and intelligently made. State v. Ferola,
    <cite class="ocri">
     518 A.2d 1339
    </cite>
    ,

    The defendant’s waiver of Miranda rights was both knowing and intelligent even if, as defendant contended, he could not speak fluent English and did not understand the full consequences of making a statement to the police, where he was advised of his rights in his native tongue and claimed to understand such rights. State v. Leuthavone,
    <cite class="ocri">

    The trial justice correctly concluded that a Cuban-born defendant who had resided in the United States for 10 years and appeared to communicate successfully with non-Spanish speakers, was sufficiently fluent in the English language to have waived his Miranda rights knowingly and intelligently. State v. Garcia,
    <cite class="ocri">
     643 A.2d 180
    </cite>
    ,

    Where, before the defendant was brought to the videotaping room, he was advised of his rights, he initialed statements given to him indicating that he understood each statement and then signed the form, and his mother signed as a witness, having been informed that her son’s rights applied to her as well, these facts, taken together with the fact that the seventeen-year-old defendant was living on his own with his girlfriend and their son, drove a car, and had held a couple of jobs, supported the finding that the defendant was apprised of his rights and, on the basis of the totality of the circumstances, had waived them knowingly and voluntarily. State v. Kryla,
    <cite class="ocri">
     742 A.2d 1178

    Defendant, a juvenile, knowingly and voluntarily waived defendant’s
    Miranda
    rights in accordance with U.S. Const. amend. V, despite the police detective’s failure to determine defendant’s reading-comprehension ability; no evidence was presented to suggest that defendant had cognitive problems, and the warnings were read to defendant in addition to defendant reading them. In re Joseph B.,
    <cite class="ocri">

    Defendant’s statements to police regarding a killing that occurred while defendant was engaged in a gang fight were voluntary because defendant was advised of defendant’s Miranda rights, defendant’s guardian was present during the interview and allowed to converse with defendant privately at several points during the interview, defendant did not appear to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and a detective testified that no one made any promises to defendant or otherwise coerced defendant into waiving defendant’s Miranda rights.

    Where the confession of a joint defendant who did not take the stand was introduced in evidence after the deletion of all references to the other two defendants, the court held that, since the two defendants’ connection with the confessing defendant was established by the independent testimony of two witnesses who were fully cross-examined, their constitutional right to confront witnesses under this amendment and former R.I. Const., Art. 1, § 10 (see now R.I. Const., Art. 1, Sec. 10) was not infringed by the admission of the confession. State v. Wilbur,

    Although generally a defendant has a constitutional right under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, to cross-examine a prosecution witness as to his present residence, without any obligation to explain the purpose of the questioning, where the personal safety of the witness is involved, the witness has been placed in his proper setting or environment and the defendant fails to demonstrate he has suffered any harm from the failure to disclose the witness’ exact address, such cross-examination may be properly excluded.

    The right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses is required in a parole violation hearing, unless the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not allowing confrontation. State v. DeRoche,
    <cite class="ocri">
     120 R.I. 523

   <p>
    A critical issue in determining the right to confrontation is always the availability of a witness. In respect to availability, a threshold determination must be made by the tribunal. If the witness is unavailable, then the tribunal may consider other elements such as reliability and evidentiary exceptions to the hearsay rule. It may also consider the effect of a statement against penal interest in determining reliability. State v. DeRoche,
    <cite class="ocri">
     120 R.I. 523

   <p>
    In its enforcement of the confrontation clause, the Supreme Court of the United States has not manifested an intention to freeze at a given point in time the development of exceptions to the exclusionary hearsay rules where indicia of reliability would justify such exceptions, even though they constitute a departure from traditional evidentiary rules. State v. DeRoche,

    Where trial was started while defendant was not present, over the objection of defendant’s counsel, and during defendant’s absence the only witness who saw defendant in possession of a handgun testified, and when defendant arrived in courtroom trial justice refused to allow defense counsel to proffer any explanation for defendant’s absence, a new trial was required.

    The better course at this time, in a period where prison practices are diverse and somewhat experimental, is to leave matters of confrontation and cross-examination to the sound discretion of the officials of state prisons. La Plante v. Southworth,

    Within the reasonable limitations necessary in the prison disciplinary context, there is no requirement but merely a suggestion that a disciplinary committee state its reason for refusing to call a witness, whether it be irrelevance, lack of necessity or the hazards presented in the individual case.

    A trial justice did not abuse his discretion so as to violate defendant’s rights to confrontation and cross-examination by limiting cross-examination of a witness to those matters which had been testified to on direct examination. State v. Benevides,

    The exercise of discretion by the trial justice in limiting the scope of cross-examination will not be disturbed except for clear abuse, and then only when such abuse constitutes prejudicial error. State v. Anthony,

   </p>
   <p>
    Questions exceeding the proper limits of cross-examination are those that harass, annoy, or humiliate the witness, or questions that are irrelevant or offer no probative value. Questions of this nature are subject to the control of the trial justice. State v. Anthony,

    Although the supreme court of the United States has ruled that a probationer or a parolee had a right at a revocation hearing to confront and cross-examine witnesses, the right of confrontation is satisfied if the trial justice has determined that the out-of-court declarant is available for cross-examination. State v. Potter,

    If the out-of-court declarant is not available for cross-examination, then the trial justice is to make a specific finding that there is just cause for not permitting confrontation before the hearsay testimony is admitted into evidence. State v. Potter,

    A defendant is entitled to cross-examine a witness granted immunity with regard to his bias or interest in testifying on behalf of the state, and this encompasses the nature of the immunity agreement and any additional promises made to or understandings reached with the witness.

    Where the sole witness’ credibility was a vital element in establishing defendant’s guilt and where the trial justice precluded the defendant from raising and probing the issues of motive, bias, or prejudice, effectively cutting off defendant’s right to test the witness’ credibility, the defendant’s constitutional right to confrontation was abrogated.

    Since the purpose of cross-examination is to impeach a witness’s credibility, the general rule that confines the scope of cross-examination to facts brought out during direct examination is inapplicable when the questions are designed either to explain, contradict, or discredit any testimony given by the witness on direct examination or to test his accuracy, memory, veracity, or credibility.

    The partiality of a witness may be explored at trial, and is always relevant for the purposes of discrediting a witness and thereby affecting the weight of his testimony; however, this does not permit a defendant to introduce evidence which is irrelevant to showing a witness’s purported bias.

    A criminal defendant’s right to cross-examination is guaranteed by this amendment and by R.I. Const., art.

    Where the only evidence defendant was allowed to place before the jury regarding a witness’s mental condition was that he had a “problem” with his memory and defense counsel was not permitted to elicit from the witness for the benefit of the jury the witness’s treatment for premature Alzheimer’s disease and the many other different conditions for which he was being treated, applying the harmless-error analysis to the facts, and particularly those elements of cross-examination that were not permitted concerning witness’s mental disease and the inferences that might be drawn therefrom, the error was not only harmless beyond a reasonable doubt but was extremely harmful to the development of defendant’s defense by restricting his ability to attack the credibility of the most important witness presented in support of the charges against him.

    In a prosecution for sexual assault, the trial justice does not impermissibly limit the cross-examination of the complaining witness, even though defense counsel’s cross-examination of the victim may not have been as effective as he would have desired, where a significant cross-examination of the victim is allowed, and there is corroborating testimony from two other witnesses.

    A state witness, on cross-examination, disclosed his substantial criminal record, including the fact that at the time of his testimony he was on probation and was subject to a deferred sentence. Only when defense counsel attempted to elicit the witness’s understanding of what a deferred sentence entailed did the trial justice sustain the state’s objections. By that point in the cross-examination defendant’s constitutional right to confrontation had been amply satisfied, and the trial justice’s decision to limit questioning could not be considered an abuse of discretion.

    The trial court did not improperly consider in a motion to reduce sentence the defendant’s exercise of his right to stand trial or his corollary right to hold the state to its burden of proving his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt through the presentation of testimony from the child victim, since the defendant forced the child to testify about the molestation in open court by exercising his right to stand trial and by presenting false testimony to the court in the hopes of escaping conviction and punishment, and had indicated his intention to appeal while knowing full well that what the little girl said from the stand was absolutely true.

    The trial court did not commit an abuse of discretion amounting to prejudicial error by limiting the defendant’s cross-examination of a police detective who received information from another officer.

    The defendant’s right to confrontation was improperly limited since the defense counsel was prohibited from questioning the sexual abuse victim about the allegations that she made against other men to the Department of Children, Youth and Families investigator, and therefore, the defense was denied the opportunity to cross-examine the victim.

    Although the juvenile record of the victim was not discoverable under Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, if the defendant had been originally informed of the existence of the record he could have taken appropriate steps in the family court to have the record made available to him; thus, the defendant was denied his right of confrontation and was entitled to a new trial.

    Five factors that are considered in making a determination whether a restriction on cross-examination constitutes harmless error include: 1) the importance of a witness’ testimony in the prosecution’s case; 2) whether the testimony is cumulative; 3) the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of a witness on material points; 4) the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted; and 5) the overall strength of the prosecution’s case.

    The right to cross examination is not unlimited. Accordingly, since there was no evidence whatsoever that the witness had taken drugs on the day of the incident, or at any time thereabouts, such that the drug use would have affected the witness’ ability to observe and recall accurately the events of the day, there was no error in the trial court’s ruling precluding the introduction of the witness’ medical history referencing the drug use.

    There was no abuse of discretion in the trial justice declaring a witness unavailable where the testimony of a police officer, the issuance of a bench warrant for the witness after he had failed to appear at trial, and a search of the facilities where he may have been detained satisfied the requirement of reasonable good faith effort on the part of the prosecution.

    Defendant was not deprived of his constitutional rights to confront and cross-examine the complaining witness by the exclusion of evidence of the prior sexual-abuse allegations the complaining witness purportedly made against her biological father when she was five years old. While both allegations were of sexual misconduct against father figures, the prior accusations defense counsel sought to introduce were different from the specific allegations against defendant of sexual penetration and the taking of nude photographs; and defense counsel had the opportunity to thoroughly attack the complaining witness’s credibility as defendant was afforded an opportunity to inquire into her purported motive to bring false accusations against defendant.

    In a prosecution for sexual abuse, the trial court did not err in refusing to grant the defendant broad access to the victim’s psychotherapy records on the alleged grounds that the victim has waived her psychotherapist-patient privilege by testifying about her discussions of the abuse with her doctor. The trial court’s

    The defendant’s right to cross-examine his accusers was violated since the trial court precluded the defendant from cross examining a witness, who placed him at the scene of a burglary, regarding any criminal activities she may have engaged in with her current boyfriend who was also charged with breaking and entering.

    In a prosecution for driving with a suspended license, a driver’s abstract from the Registry of Motor Vehicles was clearly admissible under Rules 901(b)(7) and 902(4) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, and was not excluded under Rule 803(8)(B) because it did not contain information observed by police officers or law-enforcement personnel. Also, the admission of this abstract did not violate the defendant’s right to confrontation under the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions by allowing, in effect, New York officials to testify about violations in that state. The report did not contain any statements by New York officials, only a notation of the New York violation. State v. D'Alo,

     — Conflict of Interest.

   </h5>
   <p>
    Cases in which per se conflicts of interest have been found typically involved situations where a lawyer failed to divulge a conflict implicating his own criminal conduct, and the situation where a third party with an arguable stake in the outcome of a case paid the lawyer did not necessarily result in an actual or constructive denial of the assistance of counsel. Familia-Consoro v. United States,
    <cite class="ocri">

    Where the unrebutted testimony was that the defendant’s brother, who paid the lawyer representing the defendant, never placed any restrictions on the representation to be provided, and where a defense that the brother, and not the defendant, was the guilty party, was presented, there was no showing that an improper economic motive resulted in ineffective assistance of counsel. Familia-Consoro v. United States,

    Where there was no evidence that, even had his lawyer called a witness to the stand, the man would have testified, and where the district court accepted the lawyer’s explanation that he did not subpoena the witness because he believed the witness would likely have asserted the fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination, the court did not err in finding that a non-conflict motive informed trial counsel’s refusal to subpoena the witness.

    Defendant was subject to the cause and prejudice requirement on his federal ineffective assistance of counsel claim because he had created the “conflict” of interest about which he complained by choosing to retain a particular attorney as co-counsel despite knowing all the relevant facts, and by failing to apprise the court of that conflict.

    The defendant failed to make a showing that his representation was adversely affected by a conflict of interest where his lead attorney had no such conflict, and where there was no evidence either of any influence exercised by co-counsel on the lead attorney or of knowledge on the part of the lead attorney of his co-counsel’s conflict.

    Defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel due to a conflict of interest when counsel simultaneously represented another individual in an unrelated criminal case whose child’s mother testified for the State in defendant’s case as the main eyewitness to the shooting, because (1) while counsel likely became aware that the witness was related to an individual facing criminal charges only through her representation of that individual, representing defendants with unrelated charges did not show divided loyalties, and (2) no effect on counsel’s representation of defendant was shown.

    If a defendant can show that certain evidence would not have been admitted but for counsel’s incompetence and that the evidence actually influenced the defendant’s decision to accept a guilty plea agreement, the defendant must be allowed to withdraw the plea because counsel’s incompetence rendered the plea an unknowing and unintelligent act.

    The harmless-constitutional-error doctrine may be applied to deprivations of efficacious assistance, in cases where: (1) the violation does not run to a matter so basic as to trench inexorably, by its very nature, upon the elementary rights of the accused to a fair trial; (2) the infraction is not the result of conduct fairly attributable to the government (i.e., the prosecution or the court); and (3) the determination of the quantum and effect of disadvantagement can be made objectively, without “unguided speculation.” Sparfven v.

    Defendant’s failure to testify did not support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel where the hearing justice found as a fact, based on the conflicting evidence presented at the postconviction hearing, that the defendant was fully aware of his right to testify on his own behalf and that his decision not to testify was a voluntary one, made without any improper influence from counsel.

    With respect to defendant’s argument that his trial attorney failed to maintain his innocence by remarking that he “played a very minor role at most” in the crime and that he was “not as culpable as the other players in the case,” the court found that defendant failed to submit any transcript excerpts or citations supporting his argument. Without any evidence to support his allegations, the court was unable to determine exactly what trial counsel said, in what context the alleged statements were made, and whether the statements were against defendant’s wishes; consequently, he failed to sustain his burden of showing ineffective assistance of counsel.

    Defendant did not show that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and, thus, defendant was not entitled to relief on his postconviction application in case involving drug offenses that claimed that his Sixth Amendment rights had been violated. Trial counsel’s decision not to call a man who executed an affidavit that purportedly exculpated defendant, or at least present the man’s prior testimony, appeared to be a sound tactical decision given the man’s poor credibility and prior criminal history.

    There was nothing in the record that allowed a court to conclude that counsel’s failure to compel production of a pastor’s notes prejudiced a postconviction relief applicant in any way; the notes never were produced, even at the postconviction-relief proceeding, and the hearing justice’s supposition that the notes may have been critical material was insufficient to demonstrate the necessary prejudice to the applicant that was needed to meet

    Given that a court on direct appeal found a claim that a pastor bolstered the victim’s testimony to be without merit, counsel’s failure to specify that his objection was based on impermissible bolstering was not ineffective assistance because no prejudice could have resulted from such an omission. Because the determination that a pastor’s testimony was permissible was based on the content of her testimony and not on who she was, her appearance on the local television news would have had no impact on the decision on direct appeal.

    Applicant for postconviction relief failed to meet his burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that his application should have been granted; he never presented any evidence concerning his counsel’s failure to object to a pastor’s testimony as to the pastor’s status as an expert witness—the pastor had testified as to his counseling sessions with the applicant and that the pastor had dealt with a lot of sex offenders. Furthermore, even if the applicant had presented some evidence on this issue and as a result that court were to have concluded that counsel was deficient in this regard, there was no evidence that the applicant was prejudiced by this deficiency because there was other compelling evidence of the applicant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

    Trial court properly denied defendant’s post-conviction petition as defendant had failed to overcome the strong presumption that his counsel’s performance was reasonably professional, in that counsel testified that he first learned of the traffic stop, which would provide an alibi for defendant in his murder case, just before trial, two years into his representation of defendant, and that, because no detail surrounding the stop were provided and because defendant had waited so long to provide him with this information, counsel refrained from pursuing an investigation and from seeking a continuance. The ever-shifting nature of defendant’s story served to confirm the hearing justice’s conclusion that the information about the traffic stop was withheld and disclosed only when defendant thought he could safely do so and discredited the testimony of defendant and his wife that they discussed the stop with the attorney in the early stages of his representation.

    Inmate was not denied the effective assistance of trial counsel due to counsel’s failure to introduce expert testimony because (1) the prosecution presented no such testimony to rebut, and (2) no evidence of the victim’s abnormal behavior was proffered, so an expert would have improperly tried to attack the victim’s credibility.

    Claim of ineffective assistance of counsel failed, because the testimony of trial counsel at evidentiary hearing indicated that his decisions were indeed tactical and not unreasonable in light of the circumstances; among other things, counsel had a sound basis for the decision not to use a physician’s opinion, namely that the physician essentially agreed with the State’s witness and trial counsel’s use of a nurse practitioner and the Department of Children, Youth, and Families worker as defense witnesses to shed light on prior inconsistent out-of-court statements by the victim did not rise to the level of ineffective assistance, notwithstanding the resulting corroborative testimony from both witnesses achieved by the State on cross-examination.

    While trial counsel’s conduct in disclosing the inmate’s psychiatric records to the prosecutor fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, trial counsel’s deficient performance was not so deficient as to have prejudiced the inmate and deprived him of a fair trial.

    Farce-and-mockery standard for ineffective assistance of counsel claims has no place in assessing such claims after Strickland because (1) the standard has been rejected in favor of a standard requiring reasonably competent or effective assistance, (2) nothing in Strickland purports to revive the standard, and (3) the standard is rooted in the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. V, while claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are grounded in the guarantee of the assistance of counsel contained in U.S. Const. amend. VI and R.I. Const. Decl.

    Defendant’s motion to suppress statements he made to a Massachusetts Department of Children and Families (DCF) investigator on grounds that his statements were involuntary and that his right to due process was violated was improperly granted because the investigator’s interview at defendant’s kitchen table was the antithesis of a coercive interrogation; there was no DCF policy requiring the investigator to give defendant the DCF brochure informing him of his right to counsel at the beginning of the interview, and it was not unconstitutional for the investigator to have waited until the end of the interview to give defendant the brochure; and defendant’s rights to counsel had not attached as he was not in custody and had not been charged with a crime.

    United States Supreme Court has held that the selection of a petit jury from a representative cross section of the community is an essential component of the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial; to demonstrate a prima facie violation of the fair cross section requirement, the defendant must establish: (1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a distinctive group in the community; (2) that the representation of this group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community; and (3) that this under representation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury selection process.

    It is not error for the trial justice to allow the prosecutor to use a peremptory challenge to dismiss a black juror without requiring a racially neutral, non-discriminatory explanation for the challenge, where the juror challenged is black, not a member of the defendant’s race, and the defendant shows no pattern of discrimination or other circumstances during voir dire that support a finding of a discriminatory motive on the part of the prosecutor.

    The fact that the excluded juror knew the defense attorney prior to the trial as counsel to a friend is a sufficiently neutral reason for excluding him.

    Though the indictment charging the defendant with sexual assault was inartfully drawn in that it did not refer directly to the subsection of the section under which he was being charged, the count was otherwise sufficient because the defendant, having been put on notice that he was being charged with first-degree sexual assault, suffered no prejudice; furthermore, the bill of particulars for which defendant moved with respect to other charges was sufficient to provide him with the specific circumstance of force or coercion underlying the first charge.

    Where the record did not establish that the size of the courtroom deprived defendant of a fair trial or that the public was excluded from the trial, it was not error to deny defendant’s motion to conduct trial in larger courtroom. State v. Lerner,

    Although the right to a public trial is fundamental, it is not a “limitless imperative” of a criminal defendant but rather is subject to a court’s inherent power to regulate admission to the courtroom and to restrict attendance at the trial as conditions and circumstances may reasonably demand in order to preserve order and decorum, or to protect the rights of the parties and the witnesses, or generally to further the administration of justice.

    A trial justice may properly order the public from the courtroom if, in light of the nature of the crime, the expected testimony, or the emotional state of the witness, he has determined that the testimony would likely be severely hampered or distorted if the witness were required to testify in public.

    A trial justice has the discretion to exclude spectators from the courtroom in certain circumstances, including when necessary to protect a witness from the embarrassment or emotional pressures that often result when a victim must relate the details of a lurid crime in open court.

Furthermore, and fatal to defendant’s Sixth Amendment challenge, there was no showing that anyone, whether court personnel or the citizenry, was, in fact, excluded from that portion of the trial.

    A court should not allow defendants to count, for purposes of determining the length of delay, periods of time in which defendants fail to timely comply with the state’s request for discovery and thereby profit from their own dilatory tactics. State v. Fortier,

    Right to a speedy trial was not denied where the record strongly indicated that the defendant did not want a speedy trial and that the filing of the motion was merely a perfunctory gesture since the defendant preferred to bank on the lapse of time, hoping that witnesses would disappear or memories would become dim.

    In determining whether an accused has been denied his right to a speedy trial, the courts consider four factors: (1) the length of the delay, (2) the reason for the delay, (3) the defendant’s assertion of his rights and (4) the prejudice to the accused. Yet, no one of these factors alone is either a necessary or a sufficient condition to establish a deprivation. Rather, they are all related factors and must be considered together with such other circumstances as are relevant. State v. Allan,
    <cite class="ocri">
     433 A.2d 222

    If the delay between a defendant’s arrest and commencement of his trial is long enough to be considered “presumptively prejudicial,” the remaining three criteria (the length of the delay, the reason for the delay, and the assertion of the right by the defendant) announced in Barker v. Wingo,

    Prejudice to the defendant from a delay between his arrest and commencement of his trial may take the form of pretrial incarceration, anxiety and mental strain, or impairment of the defense of the case. State v. Charette,

    A defendant’s failure to demand a speedy trial is relevant in deciding whether he has been prejudiced by delay between arrest and commencement of trial. State v. Charette,

    Delay in the commencement of defendant’s trial due in part to a technical flaw in his original indictment was not a deliberate attempt by the state to prejudice defendant. State v. Charette,

    Period of two and one-half years between arrest and commencement of the trial was at least “presumptively prejudicial.” State v. Charette,

    Where defendant first filed a speedy trial motion 12 days after arraignment and did not renew it until he called the case ready for trial almost 33 months later, defendant was less than aggressive in asserting his right to a speedy trial and this was factor weighing against defendant’s claim that he had been denied a speedy trial. State v. Allan,

    Where not only did defendant fail to demand a speedy trial but he also contributed to the delay and no serious prejudice to defendant resulted in a delay of two and one-half years between arrest and trial did not deny defendant of his right to a speedy trial. State v. Charette,

    Where proceedings were delayed as result of defense counsel’s participation in another trial, and where it was unlikely that either defendant or counsel could have anticipated at time counsel was retained that other trial would go forward well in advance of defendant’s trial, delay could not be attributed to defendant.

    Although felony trials should take place within six months of the indictment, such a policy should not be construed as indicating that a failure to meet that goal in a particular case amounts to a denial of the right to a speedy trial guaranteed by R.I. Const., Art. I, § 10 (see now R.I. Const., Art. 1, Sec. 10), and this amendment. A “presumptively prejudicial” delay may occur at 12 months in the absence of special circumstances. State v. Tarvis,

    Twenty-one month delay from time of arraignment to the time of trial did not violate defendant’s right to a speedy trial, since the state was not solely responsible for the delay, the delay attributable to the state was not tactically motivated, defendant did not actively pursue his right to a speedy trial, and, although defendant was incarcerated for the entire period from his arrest until trial thereby heightening anxiety and mental strain, he was awaiting trial for a most vicious and brutal murder and there was no evidence to support a finding that his ability to conduct his defense was impaired by the incarceration or the passage of time.

    Where defendants were neither incarcerated nor under indictment nor subject to bail during the period between the dismissal of one indictment and the issuance of a subsequent indictment, that interval could not be used to determine if there was a violation of the constitutional guarantee of a speedy trial.

    Delay caused by the criminal-court-calendar system that allows a case continued or not reached to go back into the scheduling computer for several months before being placed on the calendar again is usually accorded less weight than is delay deliberately caused by the state in order to gain a tactical advantage over a defendant; however, the ultimate responsibility for such delay must be borne by the government.

    A defendant’s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial is to be assessed according to the four-part test set forth by the United States Supreme Court in Barker v. Wingo,

    Although nearly 18 months elapsed from the date of a defendant’s arrest until the start of his trial, and such a delay was sufficient to be presumptively prejudicial, the lack of any prejudice to the defendant as a result of the delay weighed against his claim that the state violated his speedy-trial right. State v. Austin,

    The defendant’s state and federal constitutional rights to a speedy trial were violated, requiring vacating of his conviction for possession-of-a-firearm charge that was brought to trial almost 11 years after the defendant’s indictment. State v. Powers,

    The defendant was deprived of his right to a speedy trial when the delay lasted five years and was primarily attributable to the negligence of the state. State v. DeAngelis,

    Although more than five years passed between the defendant’s indictment and the trial, most of that delay was attributable to the defendant’s voluntary and unlawful absence from the state. Accordingly, the trial court found, with no objection from the defendant, that the new speedy trial clock began to run when the defendant was returned to this state. Based on this finding, the length of delay was less than twelve months and, therefore, not presumptively prejudicial, eliminating the requirement to consider the remaining three

    Where the primary reason for a one and a half year delay between the defendant’s arrest and the start of his trial was court congestion, but some of the delay was due to the fact that the defendant was tried during that time for two other cases that occurred within the same time-frame, and some was due to minor delays attributable to the defendant, the bulk of the delay being attributable to the state was weighted less heavily in a determination of the defendant’s right to a speedy trial because the delay was the product of crowded calendars and not deliberate conduct.

    Where, over the course of a year and a half, defendant never requested a speedy trial, but waited until ten months after his arrest to move to dismiss the charges, renewing this motion five months later, defendant’s efforts fell short of evidencing a real desire to invoke his constitutional rights and proceed to trial.

    Defendant was not denied a speedy trial since, although the state moved for and obtained several continuances, it was not primarily responsible for causing the long delays, most of which were attributable to the defendant’s churning through the seven attorneys who represented him.

    A defendant was more culpable than the state for causing a delay in his trial since he knew of his indictment, his initial court date, and the warrant for his arrest, yet still left the jurisdiction for 16 years, which was not merely negligent but willful and deliberate. State v. Crocker,

    Where a defendant intentionally avoided returning to the jurisdiction to face charges that he knew or should have known were still pending against him, and was thus himself largely responsible for the delay in his eventual trial, any presumptive prejudice he may have suffered was insufficient by itself to support a finding that the state violated his right to a speedy trial.

    Trial court did not err by failing to recognize defendant’s remarks at the commencement of his trial as a motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial as no such motion was articulated for the trial justice to have made a ruling on, and defendant’s counsel made no such motion. As a result, defendant’s issue on appeal that the trial court erred by denying his pro se motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial was deemed unpreserved for appellate review. State v. Bido,

    Defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to move to dismiss an indictment on speedy trial grounds; as much of the 14-year delay between the applicant’s arrest and his extradition to Rhode Island was attributable to his flight from the state and his attempts to fight extradition, such a motion would have been denied.

    Defendant was not prejudiced by a delay of 67 months between the reversal of his first conviction and his retrial, where defendant acquiesced in the delay attributable to a codefendant, obtained another delay owing to his fear of improper publicity, and did not generally show an aggressive assertion of his right to a speedy trial.

    Defendant’s right to a speedy trial was not violated, even though the 45-month delay between the vacation of the conviction from defendant’s first trial and the commencement of his retrial was presumptively prejudicial, where the primary reasons for the delay were defendant’s first attorney’s unpreparedness for trial and his second attorney’s reasonable trial preparation efforts.

    Inadequate medical care to prisoners does not reach the level of a constitutional violation because of inadvertent or negligent errors in diagnosis or treatment; rather, the test of constitutional violation, which amounts to a recklessness standard, requires a showing of conscious disregard by the defendants of a substantial risk that serious injury or illness would be engendered or prolonged by the inadequacies of the medical system.

But in choosing the president, the votes shall be taken by states, the representation from each state having one vote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two-thirds of the states, and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice. And if the house of representatives shall not choose a president whenever the right of choice shall devolve upon them, before the fourth day of March next following, then the vice-president shall act as president, as in the case of the death or other constitutional disability of the president.

    Where the class of persons who were “evicted” were individuals who were never public employees, at least in the capacity for which the state pensions were sought, and were permitted to enter the system at bargain-basement prices while retaining their pensions as union employees, the choice to evict them, returning their contributions with interest, was not so patently arbitrary, irrational, or unrelated to a legitimate legislative purpose as to constitute a violation of substantive due process.

    The due process and equal protection rights of the owners of a proposed outpatient abortion facility are violated where (1) the town applies the definition of a hospital under local zoning ordinances to the facility, thereby requiring it to obtain a special use permit before it can operate, but other facilities in the town which perform minor surgery are not required to obtain special use permits and (2) the town revokes the facility’s building permit after a full month of construction passes without granting a pre-revocation hearing.

    Due process of law does not require that the legislature, when prescribing a fact-finding process for an administrative board of review, must cloak the process it adopts with the sophisticated technicalities governing the admissibility of evidence in an adversary proceeding litigated in a court of law, but it is sufficient if the prescribed procedure affords a claimant a reasonable opportunity to challenge the correctness of the information on which the board relied.

    Although the ordinance made no provision for predeterminate notice and hearing, and orders to owners of property commanding connection of their premises to the sewer system were, as an initial matter, wholly dependent upon determination made ex parte by the city public works director, this procedure was not constitutionally defective, because full judicial review of such orders was available to property owners.

    An administrative hearing officer is not required to assume a wholly passive role and may participate in the proceeding whenever necessary to the end that the hearing proceed in an orderly, expeditious fashion, but he must be impartial and must not attempt to establish proof to support the position of any party to the controversy. Once he does so, he becomes an advocate or participant, thus ceasing to function as an impartial trier of fact and such a transformation gives risk to a lack of the fundamental fairness required by due process.

    Resolution of the issue whether the administrative procedures provided to an aggrieved party are constitutionally sufficient requires analysis of the governmental and private interests that are affected. This analysis requires consideration of three distinct factors: (1) the private interest that will be affected by the official action, (2) the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used and the possible value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards, and (3) the government’s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirements would entail.

    In ruling on a petition for preliminary injunction, the federal district court rejected the equal protection claim that the exemption granted to small retail stores by § 5-23-2 constituted invidious discrimination against plaintiff, a large retailer, since the legislature had the reasonable aim to minimize both the number of employees working on Sunday and the amount of commercial activity on Sunday.

    While to interpret § 5-21-3 as including within its scope any property on which is collected a miniscule accumulation of automobile parts and accessories, such as a pair of unserviceable windshield wipers or a few discarded spark plugs, is literally correct, it is manifestly contrary to the intent of the legislature, but does not render the automobile licensing law unconstitutional because of vagueness and indefiniteness.

    The existence of different limitation periods for suits for negligence and for wrongful death does not violate the equal protection rights of tort victims who die from their injuries, since there is a clear distinction between the nature of the plaintiffs involved which fully supports the state’s decision to treat the two types of plaintiff differently, i.e., the personal injury plaintiff’s initial need to recover from his injuries and to know the extent of his injuries, the likelihood of the community-disturbing event of death prompting more immediate focus by third parties upon the cause thereof, and the interest of both the survivors and the state in prompt settlement of the affairs of a deceased.

    In order to be constitutionally fair, “showup” identification of a defendant must satisfy the “totality of the circumstances” test, which requires analysis of the following factors: the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness’ degree of attention, the accuracy of the witness’ prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of time between the crime and the confrontation, which factors must be balanced against the suggestiveness of the showup; the degree of suggestiveness, in order to violate due process, must give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.

    Even assuming a photo array was suggestive insofar as defendant was the only one of the six mustached white males in the photo array wearing a navy golf shirt, which a victim had said one of the perpetrators was wearing, defendant’s due process rights were not violated by the admission of the identification into evidence where defendant was in the back seat of the car, next to the victim, for 30 minutes with the interior light of the car on the whole time and where the victim had ample opportunity to view the defendant with her attention focused on him as he rifled through her purse and belongings.

    Prosecution failed to establish knowing and intentional waiver of defendant’s privilege against self-incrimination where record showed that defendant made no reply when asked if he understood his constitutional rights as given in a Miranda warning, but that shortly thereafter defendant responded to police question whether his confederates were armed; and since defendant’s response to that question corroborated circumstantial evidence of his guilt, its introduction constituted reversible error.

    Strict scrutiny review is applied to all statutes and state-supported rules that classify individuals by race or ethnicity. Classifications by race or ethnicity demand strict scrutiny because no situation justifies the state from classifying individuals by race or ethnicity. Classifying persons according to race or ethnicity is more likely to reflect prejudice than legitimate public concern. Thus the strict scrutiny analysis is applied, and almost without exception racial or ethnic classifications are struck down as violations of equal protection. Kleczek v.

    The year-and-a-day rule, which established a conclusive presumption that when death occurs more than a year and a day after the criminal act, the death was due to natural causes rather than a result of the criminal act, was in effect and hence accepted by the state legislature as part of the state’s jurisprudence, both before and after the enactment of the constitution in 1842, as being part of the body of common law that had not been specifically abrogated by the writers of the constitution; but the Supreme Court holds that the rule does not remain viable in light of the state of modern medical and forensic science and the structure of procedural protections afforded criminal defendants by various statutes, case law, and rules of practice and procedure.

When the right to vote is subjected to severe restrictions, the regulation must be narrowly drawn to advance a state interest of compelling importance; when the state law imposes only reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions upon the rights of voters, the state’s important regulatory interests are generally sufficient to justify the restrictions.

    Even if the limited liability company could have established that the zoning certificates gave rise to a constitutionally protected property right, it could not establish that it was deprived of that interest without due process of law; the fact that the LLC was not provided with a hearing prior to the deprivation of its purported property right did not, by itself, establish a violation of due process.

    Any marginal First Amendment interest the bar-owning plaintiffs may have had in topless barroom dancing was outweighed by the state’s Twenty-First Amendment interest in regulating the circumstances under which liquor may be served. Thus, a city ordinance prohibiting nude dancing in a bar served a legitimate state purpose and was rationally related to the achievement of the purpose. Wreck Bar v. Comolli,

    Rhode Island’s statutory prohibition against advertisements that provide the public with accurate information about retail prices of alcoholic beverages is unconstitutional; this holding rests on the conclusion that such an advertising ban is an abridgment of speech protected by the First Amendment and that it is not shielded from constitutional scrutiny by the Twenty-first Amendment. 44 Liquormart v.
