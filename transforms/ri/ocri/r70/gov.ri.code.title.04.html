       Withdrawal from distribution orders.  When the director or the director’s authorized agent has reasonable cause to believe any lot of commercial feed is being distributed in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter or of any of the prescribed regulations under this chapter, he or she may issue and enforce a written or printed withdrawal from distribution order, warning the distributor not to dispose of the lot of commercial feed in any manner until written permission is given by the director or the court.

      The director of environmental management may appoint one or more inspectors in the state, whose duty it is to visit and inquire into the condition of any domestic animal in the state whenever there is reason to suspect that any domestic animal, the carcass of any domestic animal or tissues or products, is affected with tuberculosis, or other contagious, infectious, or communicable disease; and the inspectors are authorized to quarantine any diseased domestic animal, the carcass of any diseased domestic animal, or restrict the movement of any tissues or products produced by any domestic animal until such quarantine or movement restriction is released by a veterinarian employed by the director. The director may also employ, from time to time, any number of veterinary surgeons that he or she may find necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.

     <p>
      In the case of any bovine animal condemned as having any infectious, contagious, or communicable disease considered dangerous to livestock or public health, upon receipt of a post mortem examination, conducted by a veterinarian approved by the department of environmental management or one licensed to practice veterinary medicine in this state, the state may pay to the owner an indemnity not to exceed the difference between the appraised value of each animal destroyed less the net salvage received by the owner and any funds received from federal indemnity payments. No payment shall exceed five hundred dollars ($500), and any joint state federal indemnity payments plus salvage shall not exceed the appraised value of the animals. No payment shall be made for any animal that is condemned and killed if that animal is from a herd that has not been maintained in accordance with the rules, regulations, and standards of the state, and of any state and federal regulations for the suppression of bovine disease or if that animal has been imported into this state where there has been no compliance with the rules, regulations, and standards of the state governing the requirements for importation. The premises where the diseased animal has been kept shall be thoroughly cleansed and disinfected according to the regulations of the department of environmental management.

      If after the importation of cattle by any person, firm, corporation, or association, the director of environmental management is of the opinion that any of the cattle imported are at risk to be infected with tuberculosis, or if he or she has reason to question the accuracy or reliability of the test charts under which the cattle were imported into this state, or if for any other reason he or she believes any of the cattle so imported may be affected with tuberculosis, the director, if in his or her judgment that action appears advisable, shall place the cattle in quarantine at their destination or at some other suitable place to be designated by the director, and the cattle shall be held in quarantine for a period of not more than ninety (90) days or until released by order of the director within that period. While those cattle are held in quarantine, the director shall cause them to be tested for tuberculosis with tuberculin by the intradermic test.

       Thoroughbred dogs exempt — Kennel licenses.

     </h3>
     <p>
      No license fee is imposed on any thoroughbred dogs kept for breeding and stud purposes only; provided, that the dog is owned by a breeder or annual exhibitor of thoroughbred dogs; and provided, further, that the dogs are kept in a breeding kennel licensed in accordance with the provisions of this section, and only allowed at large in charge of the owner or keeper of that kennel. Every owner or keeper of thoroughbred dogs may make application to the city or town clerk or board of police commissioners or chief of police granting the dog licenses in the town or city in which that kennel is proposed to be located for what shall be known as a kennel license. The application states the name or names of the owner and keeper of the kennel, the proposed location of the kennel, and the number of dogs to be kept; and that the dogs are to be kept only for breeding and stud purposes. If that town or city clerk or board of police commissioners or chief of police deems that the kennel and the use and operation of that kennel at that location would not constitute a public nuisance, he, she, or they shall issue a kennel license authorizing the owner or keeper to keep the kennel in the definite location to be specified in the license, upon the payment by the applicant of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for the license. Every kennel license is for a period not exceeding one year and expires on the first day of April. All moneys received shall be credited to the dog fund of the town or city. Any person without a kennel license who establishes or keeps a kennel shall be fined not exceeding five dollars ($5.00) for each day the kennel is kept.

Any person may cause any dog not so collared to be impounded in the public pound of the town or city where the dog is found; and if the dog is not claimed by its owner or keeper within a period of five (5) days after the impoundment, the dog may be disposed of or destroyed. The five (5) days shall not include any day or part of a day that the public pound is not open for a specified period of time, not to be less than one-half (1/2) the normal hours of business, for the purpose of reclaiming any impounded  dog by its rightful owner. All periods of time shall be listed in a prominent location at the entrance to all public pounds. The owner or keeper of any dog so impounded shall not take the dog out of the pound until he or she has first paid to the poundkeeper the expense of keeping the dog, that expense not to exceed two dollars ($2.00) per day and to be determined by the city or town council in which impoundment occurs. The town council of the town of Glocester may, by ordinance, determine an expense not to exceed ten dollars ($10.00) for each of the first five (5) days during which this impoundment occurs plus five dollars ($5.00) every day the animal is detained, plus an additional ten dollars ($10.00) if the owner or keeper is unable to show that the dog has a current rabies shot pursuant to § 4-13-31, and further, the dog shall not be released from the pound until all the provisions of this chapter and the ordinances of the city or town are complied with. The provisions of this section relating to the five-day (5) waiting period shall not be deemed to apply to any dog which, when impounded, was injured or maimed, and after the dog has been examined by a licensed veterinarian who shall confirm, in writing, that the dog be destroyed for humanitarian purposes.

        It has been established that in the so-called “dog-bite” statute, R.I. Gen. Laws § 4-13-16, the clause “while traveling on the highway or out of the enclosure of the owner or keeper of such dog” modifies the word “person” and not the word “dog.” Therefore, the dog-bite statute imposes strict liability in any circumstance when the dog is outside of its owner’s enclosure. Johnston v. Poulin,

       </p>
       <p>
        Whereas the strict liability of the dog-bite statute, R.I. Gen. Laws § 4-13-16, is predicated upon the location of the dog at the time of the injury, the strict liability of R.I. Gen. Laws § 4-14-1 is predicated upon the conduct of the horse at the time of injury, whether or not it was “at large” or unrestrained at the time of the injury. Johnston v. Poulin,

        In an action for injuries resulting from a dog bite, the peaceable character of the dog was not material, because the statute has enlarged the common law liability of the dog’s owner or keeper. Whittet v. Bertsch,

        Rhode Island Supreme Court has never stated that the only type of prior incident which would suffice to indicate a dog’s vicious propensity is restricted to a bite; the pertinent language of this section imposes liability when a dog assaults, bites, or otherwise injures any person. Other kinds of canine behavior that might cause injury to persons may clearly indicate a dog’s vicious propensities; therefore, a determination of whether a incident relating to a scratch by an offending dog rose to the level of a vicious propensity was one that should properly have been made by a finder of fact after a trial.

        The purpose of the enclosure is to give the entrant reasonable notice that he is entering upon occupied premises where there may be a dog and the requisite notice is afforded if the premises are set apart from adjoining property by boundaries sufficiently apparent to indicate the approximate limits of occupation.

        In a dog bite case wherein a guest was bitten in a second floor apartment leased from the building owner, who lived in the first-floor apartment, a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the second-floor apartment was an entirely separate “enclosure” from the first-floor apartment where the dog had been because there was no inquiry into whether the second-floor apartment was kept locked and whether the owner was excluded from the premises.

        In a dog bite case, there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether a delivery man was within an enclosure at the time he was bitten; the existence of an enclosure for purposes of this section was usually a fact-intensive inquiry.

        The important thing in determining whether a dog is within an enclosure is that there be something to give a man reasonable notice that he is about to enter upon occupied premises where there may be a dog. Wilbur v. Gross,

        The purpose of the enclosure is to give the entrant reasonable notice that he is entering upon occupied premises where there may be a dog and the requisite notice is afforded if the premises are set apart from adjoining property by boundaries sufficiently apparent to indicate the approximate limits of occupation.

        If any person is to have the right to kill a dog which may assault him he must keep out of the enclosure of the owner or keeper of the dog, and if such person enters the enclosure of another person he loses the right to kill a dog there if he is suddenly assaulted by such dog while inside the enclosure.

       For the purpose of preventing the introduction of rabies when rabies appears in any nearby area and its appearance creates a threat of introduction into Rhode Island, or for the suppression, or for the control of rabies, the board shall make regulations requiring compulsory vaccination of dogs, cats, ferrets or any other domestic animal as deemed necessary against rabies in a manner specified by it in any area or areas within the state, which are deemed necessary to prevent that introduction, or for the purposes of suppression and control.

      A person owning, keeping or possessing a dog shall not allow, permit or consent to this dog chasing, hunting, molesting, attacking, or killing a deer. The director of environmental management is authorized to issue an order to restrain all dogs from running at large in any city or town where, in the director’s opinion, this restraining order is necessary to prevent dogs from chasing, hunting, molesting, attacking, or killing deer. This order shall be in effect forty-eight (48) hours after publication in one or more newspapers circulated in the city or town. When, in the director’s opinion, the director determines that this restraining order is no longer necessary, the director shall, by publication, rescind this order. A person owning, keeping, or possessing a dog shall restrain it from running at large in any city or town in which this restraining order is in effect. The chief of the division of enforcement, the chief’s assistants, conservation officers, members of the state police, members of the local police, in areas over which they have jurisdiction, may issue a citation to the owner of any dog found chasing, hunting, molesting, attacking, or killing a deer, charging the owner with a violation of this chapter. During any period when this order is not in force, the chief of the division of enforcement, the chief’s assistants, conservation officers and members of the state police and members of the local police and park police in areas over which they have jurisdiction, may issue a citation to the owner of any dog found chasing or hunting a deer if the dog is chasing or hunting with the knowledge or consent of the owner. Whenever a dog has been found chasing, hunting, molesting, attacking, or killing a deer and the owner or keeper of the dog has been notified by the director, and the same dog is found chasing, hunting, molesting, attacking, or killing, it shall be prima facie evidence that this chasing, hunting, molesting, attacking, or killing was with the knowledge or consent of the owner or keeper.

       Action for damages — Destruction of offending vicious dog.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If any dog declared vicious under § 4-13.1-11, when unprovoked, kills or wounds, or assists in killing or wounding, any domestic animal, belonging to or in the possession of any person, or, when unprovoked, attacks, assaults, bites, or otherwise injures any human being or assists in attacking, assaulting, biting or otherwise injuring any human being while out of or within the enclosure of the owner or keeper of the vicious dog, or while otherwise on or off the property of the owner or keeper whether or not the vicious dog was on a leash and securely muzzled or whether the vicious dog escaped without fault of the owner or keeper, the owner or keeper of the dog may be liable to the person aggrieved for all damage sustained, to be recovered in a civil action, with costs of suit. It is rebuttably presumed as a matter of law that the owning, keeping, or harboring of a dog that has been declared vicious in violation of this chapter is a nuisance. It shall not be necessary, in order to sustain any action, to prove that the owner or keeper of a dog that has been declared vicious knew that the dog that has been declared vicious possessed the propensity to cause this damage or that the dog had a vicious nature.

The hearing shall be conducted by a panel of three (3) persons that shall consist of the chief of police, or his or her designee, the executive director of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (S.P.C.A.), or his or her designee; and a person chosen by the chief of police and the executive director of the S.P.C.A. All members of the panel shall have one vote in making a determination whether or not the dog in question is vicious. Hearing officers shall have immunity.

      <li id="t04c13.1s4-13.1-11ol1b">
       After the hearing, the owner or keeper of the dog shall be notified in writing of the determination. If a determination is made that the dog is vicious, the owner or keeper shall comply with this chapter in accordance with a time schedule established by the dog officer or chief of police, but in no case more than thirty (30) days subsequent to the date of the determination. If the owner or keeper of the dog contests the determination, he or she may, within five (5) days of that determination, bring a petition in the district court within the judicial district where the dog is owned or kept, praying that the court conduct its own hearing on whether or not the dog should be declared vicious. After service of notice upon the dog officer, the court shall conduct a hearing de novo and make its own determination as to viciousness. The hearing shall be conducted within seven (7) days of the service of the notice upon the dog officer or law enforcement officer involved. The issue shall be decided upon the preponderance of the evidence. If the court rules the dog to be vicious, the court may establish a time schedule to ensure compliance with this chapter, but in no case more than thirty (30) days subsequent to the date of the court’s determination. If the owner has not complied with the provisions of this chapter at the end of thirty (30) days from the written notification that the dog is vicious, the dog may be euthanized.

       The determination of the district court shall be final and conclusive upon all parties. The dog officer or any law enforcement officer shall have the right to convene a hearing under this section for any subsequent actions of the dog.

       In the event that the dog officer or law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that the dog in question is vicious and may pose a threat of serious harm to human beings or other domestic animals, the dog officer or law enforcement officer may seize and impound the dog pending the hearings.
       <p id="t04c13.1s4-13.1-11ol1e.1">
        The owner or keeper of the dog is liable to the city or town where the dog is impounded for the costs and expenses of keeping the dog. The city or town council may establish by ordinance a schedule of those costs and expenses.

        When an animal specified in R.I. Gen. Laws § 4-14-1 ceases to be “at large”, a mixed question of law and fact is presented. Johnston v. Poulin,
        <cite class="ocri">
         844 A.2d 707
        </cite>
        ,
        <cite class="ocri">

        </cite>
        (R.I. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        For purposes of determining liability under R.I. Gen. Laws § 4-14-1, the distinguishing factor in determining whether an animal is “at large” is the presence or absence of control. If an animal is roaming at will and free to follow its own instincts, it may be said to be “at large;” however, if it is either physically restrained or subject to the moral authority of the person in charge, it is not “at large.” Johnston v. Poulin,
        <cite class="ocri">

        Whereas the strict liability of the dog-bite statute, R.I. Gen. Laws § 4-13-16, is predicated upon the location of the dog at the time of the injury, the strict liability of R.I. Gen. Laws § 4-14-1 is predicated upon the conduct of the horse at the time of injury, whether or not it was “at large” or unrestrained at the time of the injury. Johnston v. Poulin,

     <p>
      It is declared and determined as a matter of legislative finding that the use of humane methods in the slaughter of livestock prevents needless suffering, results in safer and better working conditions for persons engaged in the slaughtering industry, brings about improvement of products and economy in slaughtering operations, and produces other benefits for producers, processors, and consumers that tend to expedite the orderly flow of livestock and their products. It is declared to be the policy of the state to require that the slaughter of all livestock and the handling of livestock, in connection with slaughter, be carried out only by humane methods and to provide that methods of slaughter conform generally to those employed in other states where humane slaughter is required by law and to those authorized by the Federal Humane Slaughter Act of 1958,

        State law undermined the plaintiff’s property interest claim in a raccoon, since a permit is required for such an animal taken from the wild to be lawfully possessed, and the failure of the plaintiff to obtain a permit meant that the animal could not be reduced to private ownership and lawful possession as property.

Each and every incidence of non-compliance by an adopting party which continues unremedied for thirty (30) days after written notice of a violation under this section constitutes a subsequent offense and the attendant penalties will apply. Second and subsequent offenses may constitute grounds for seizure and forfeiture of the dog or cat, which seizure will be conducted by a dog officer or a police officer for the city or town in which the adopting party resides, and the seized animal will be returned to the licensed releasing agency from which it was adopted, which licensed releasing agency will be free to adopt out or euthanize the seized dog or cat. The adopting party loses all ownership rights in the seized dog or cat, forfeits all rights to any fee or deposit paid for the dog or cat, and shall have no claim against the licensed releasing agency or any other person for any expenses incurred by the adopting party for the dog or cat’s maintenance. The provisions of §§ 4-19-16 — 4-19-18 will be enforced against an adopting party by a dog officer or a police officer for the city or town in which the adopting party resides.

The third and subsequent offenses may result in the temporary or permanent revocation of the licensed releasing agency’s license to operate. Compliance by the releasing agency with §§ 4-19-16 — 4-19-18 will be monitored as to the licensed releasing agencies by the state veterinarian.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The state finds that a cat identification program, which would require an owner of a cat to maintain an identification for the cat, would serve the following public purposes:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t04c22s4-22-1ol11">
       Cat identification would provide cats protection under the law, equal to that afforded dogs, by establishing ownership which, in turn, would encourage cat owners to take full responsibility for their pets’ welfare.
      </li>
      <li id="t04c22s4-22-1ol12">
       Cat identification would protect cats, as dogs are now protected, by establishing minimum holding periods for cats released to and/or impounded by municipal animal control facilities and private animal shelters.
      </li>
      <li id="t04c22s4-22-1ol13">
       A program to require cat identification should facilitate the return of lost, owned cats.
      </li>
      <li id="t04c22s4-22-1ol14">
       Cat identification would provide a method to help distinguish between owned and unowned cat populations thus assisting animal control officers and animal shelters in carrying out their mission.
      </li>
      <li id="t04c22s4-22-1ol15">
       Cat identification would advance the reduction of the untold suffering of cats at-large in our state by helping to insure the quick return of injured and sick animals to their owners.
      </li>
      <li id="t04c22s4-22-1ol16">
       Passage of this bill would reduce the number of unowned cats and increase education to owners as to the need for sterilization of cats, thereby reducing unwanted litters, eliminating cat over-population problems, and reducing the costs to cities and towns for euthanizing at-large or unowned cats.
      </li>
      <li id="t04c22s4-22-1ol17">
       Cat identification would help support public health and safety in the control of rabies.
       <p id="t04c22s4-22-1ol17.1">
        The purpose of this chapter, therefore, is to establish a cat identification program, which would require that an owner of a cat maintain an identification for the cat. These measures will also reduce the spread of rabies.

      For the purposes of this chapter:
     </p>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t04c22s4-22-2ol1a">
       “At-large” means: (1) On the premises of a person other than an owner of the cat, without the consent of an occupant or owner of such premises, or (2) on a public street or highway, on public or private school grounds, or in any other public place, except when under the physical control of an owner.
      </li>
      <li id="t04c22s4-22-2ol1b">
       “Feral cat” means any wild, unsocialized or untamed cat.
      </li>
      <li id="t04c22s4-22-2ol1c">
       “Guardian” shall mean a person(s) having the same rights and responsibilities of an owner, and both terms shall be used interchangeably. A guardian shall also mean a person who possesses, has title to or an interest in, harbors or has control, custody or possession of an animal and who is responsible for an animal’s safety and well being.
      </li>
      <li id="t04c22s4-22-2ol1d">
       “Identification” means: a traceable form of identification such as (1) a collar and a flat or hanging tag worn by a cat which includes the current name, address and telephone number of the owner, or (2) a rabies vaccination tax, or (3) an ear tag issued by a licensed veterinarian or by a licensed animal shelter or licensed municipal pound, or (4) a registered microchip which is used in conjunction with a visible collar and tag or in conjunction with a faceted, reflective ear stud, or (5) a tag from a licensed animal shelter or licensed municipal pound, or (6) a tattoo registered with the National Dog Registry or other similar national tattoo service, or (7) a cat license issued by a Rhode Island city or town, or (8) a collar incorporating embroidery as a type of information labeling rather than a hanging or flat tag or (9) in the case of feral cats, a tipped or notched ear in conjunction with a microchip or any of the above other forms of identification. The intent is to allow flexibility in the types of identification available for cats and to incorporate other types of cat identification in the future as they are developed.
      </li>
      <li id="t04c22s4-22-2ol1e">
       “Impounded cat” means any cat released to or under the custody of or control of a licensed animal shelter or licensed municipal pound.
      </li>
      <li id="t04c22s4-22-2ol1f">
       “Owner” means (1) any person who keeps, has permanent custody, owns, maintains, harbors, provides care or sustenance for, has control or charge of or responsibility for a cat or who permits a cat to habitually be or remain on or be lodged or fed within such person’s property or premises, and (2) any refusal to permit any animal control officer to impound such cat shall be deemed evidence of ownership unless ownership of the cat by another party is established.
      </li>
      <li id="t04c22s4-22-2ol1g">
       “Person” means an individual, firm, jointstock company, partnership, association, private, or municipal corporation, state, commission, political subdivision, a state, any interstate body or the federal government or any agency or subdivision thereof.

     <ol>
      <li id="t04c24s4-24-2ol11">
       An unacceptable number of healthy, but abandoned cats are euthanized annually in Rhode Island.
      </li>
      <li id="t04c24s4-24-2ol12">
       Due to the large number of stray and abandoned cats, euthanasia is not a cost effective, acceptable or ethical solution to the threats to public health and safety posed by large populations of stray, feral or homeless cats.
      </li>
      <li id="t04c24s4-24-2ol13">
       Stray and abandoned pets, specifically cats, create numerous public health and safety problems, including transmission of disease and traffic hazards created by cats running loose on public streets.
      </li>
      <li id="t04c24s4-24-2ol14">
       A permit system for breeding of cats owned or harbored in the state, combined with a program for spaying/neutering, is a reasonable and effective means of reducing the population of abandoned or stray cats, and for eliminating the practice of euthanizing homeless cats, except those for whom euthanasia is an escape from suffering or necessary to protect people and/or other animals from vicious behavior.
       <p id="t04c24s4-24-2ol14.1">
        The general assembly therefor finds and declares that it intends to provide for the public health, safety and welfare through a program requiring spaying and neutering cats unless appropriate permits are acquired. The provisions of this chapter shall be in addition to the cat registration or identifying program requirements set forth in this title.
