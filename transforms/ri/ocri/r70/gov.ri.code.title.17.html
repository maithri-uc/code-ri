        A regularly scheduled statewide election constitutes a general election for purposes of R.I. Const. Art. 14, § 1, even though state officers are not on the ballot. In 2008, an even-numbered year when the state’s general offices are not in contention, voters will cast their ballots for the President of the United States, a statewide and national election of no small significance. Bowen v. Mollis,

        The 5% threshold in R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-1-2(9)(iii) to establish “political party” status, while onerous, was constitutional. The requirement had received the stamp of constitutional approval in numerous ballot access challenges dating back four decades, and against such authority, the 5% requirement did not intrude significantly on the rights of plaintiffs, and because the burden of collecting 23,588 signatures was modest, the important state interest in avoiding confusion, deception, and even frustration of the democratic process was sufficient to justify the limitation on associational and voting rights. Block v. Mollis,
        <cite class="ocri">
         618 F. Supp. 2
        </cite>

       </p>
       <p>
        Under any level of scrutiny, the State presented no legitimate regulatory interest whatsoever to justify the January 1 start date for obtaining signatures for political party status; while the 5% requirement for signatures alone passed constitutional muster, it could not erase the lack of justification for the late start date. The appropriate remedy was to strike the offending portion, the second sentence of R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-1-2(9), and it followed that plaintiff political party, political action committee, and party founder, were entitled to injunctive relief as to enforcement of the January 1 start date.

 MANNER OF APPOINTING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTORS IN MEMBER STATES.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to the time set by law for the meeting and voting by the presidential electors, the chief election official of each member state shall determine the number of votes for each presidential slate in each state of the United States and in the District of Columbia in which votes have been cast in a statewide popular election and shall add such votes together to produce a “national popular vote total” for each presidential slate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The chief election official of each member state shall designate the presidential slate with the largest national popular vote total as the “national popular vote winner.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The presidential elector certifying official of each member state shall certify the appointment in that official’s own state of the elector slate nominated in that state in association with the national popular vote winner.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least six (6) days before the day fixed by law for the meeting and voting by the presidential electors, each member state shall make a final determination of the number of popular votes cast in the state for each presidential slate and shall communicate an official statement of such determination within twenty-four (24) hours to the chief election official of each other member state.
      </p>
      <p>
       The chief election official of each member state shall treat as conclusive an official statement containing the number of popular votes in a state for each presidential slate made by the day established by federal law for making a state’s final determination conclusive as to the counting of electoral votes by Congress.
      </p>
      <p>
       In event of a tie for the national popular vote winner, the presidential elector certifying official of each member state shall certify the appointment of the elector slate nominated in association with the presidential slate receiving the largest number of popular votes within that official’s own state.
      </p>
      <p>
       If, for any reason, the number of presidential electors nominated in a member state in association with the national popular vote winner is less than or greater than that state’s number of electoral votes, the presidential candidate on the presidential slate that has been designated as the national popular vote winner shall have the power to nominate the presidential electors for that state and that state’s presidential elector certifying official shall certify the appointment of such nominees.
      </p>
      <p>
       The chief election official of each member state shall immediately release to the public all vote counts or statements of votes as they are determined or obtained.
      </p>
      <p>
       This article shall govern the appointment of presidential electors in each member state in any year in which this agreement is, on July 20, in effect in states cumulatively possessing a majority of the electoral votes.

 OTHER PROVISIONS.
      </p>
      <p>
       This agreement shall take effect when states cumulatively possessing a majority of the electoral votes have enacted this agreement in substantially the same form and the enactments by such states have taken effect in each state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any member state may withdraw from this agreement, except that a withdrawal occurring six (6) months or less before the end of a president’s term shall not become effective until a president or vice president shall have been qualified to serve the next term.
      </p>
      <p>
       The chief executive of each member state shall promptly notify the chief executive of all other states of when this agreement has been enacted and has taken effect in that official’s state, when the state has withdrawn from this agreement, and when this agreement takes effect generally.
      </p>
      <p>
       This agreement shall terminate if the electoral college is abolished.
      </p>

      It is the intent of the general assembly that the board of elections be a board on which all the qualified electors of the state, regardless of their political identification or the lack of it, will be eligible to serve. The governor, in making these appointments, and the senate, in confirming them, shall consider the abilities and integrity of the qualified electors under consideration and their knowledge of and/or experience in the working of the election laws of the state. They shall strive to select a board whose membership shall be representative of all citizens of the state and of their diverse points of view.

        In a declaratory judgment suit brought by a political party and a gubernatorial campaign against the State Board of Elections seeking to stop the Board from investigating a violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-10.1, the trial court clearly erred by holding that the Board was required to adopt rules and regulations relevant to its regulatory powers before it could investigate complaints.

The mayor or the president of the town council shall nominate the members of the canvassing authority from lists of party voters submitted by the respective chairpersons of the city or town political committee, which lists shall contain the names of five (5) times the number of persons to be appointed. If the legislative body refuses to approve the nomination of any person to the canvassing authority, the mayor or the president shall submit to the legislative body another person named on one of the lists, and so on until a person is appointed. If the chairperson of the city or town committee of a political party entitled to an appointment fails or refuses to submit a list, the mayor or the president shall nominate any party voter of the political party entitled to the appointment.

        The process for the appointment of local canvassing authority members is facially nondiscriminatory; the practice of distinguishing between political parties based on past electoral accomplishment is not per se invidiously discriminatory. Additionally, these statutes have no direct effect on ballot access, the right to vote, or the right to have one’s vote counted; local boards of canvassers perform the administrative functions of running and managing elections.

        The amendment of 1958 by which the chairmen are now required to submit lists “of party voters” did not in any manner change the obligation of the appointing authority in that respect. The amendment was obviously intended to restrict the broad power to designate potential nominees formerly held by the party chairmen by requiring them to make their selection for the lists of potential nominees to be submitted to the appointing authority from among the “party voters” of their respective parties.

        The process for the appointment of local canvassing authority members is facially nondiscriminatory; the practice of distinguishing between political parties based on past electoral accomplishment is not per se invidiously discriminatory. Additionally, these statutes have no direct effect on ballot access, the right to vote, or the right to have one’s vote counted; local boards of canvassers perform the administrative functions of running and managing elections.

        Superior court properly confirmed an arbitrator’s finding that an employee’s dispute with a town regarding elimination of her clerical position was arbitrable by the union, as the employee clearly was a member of the bargaining unit. Although the employee was appointed by the local board of canvassers under R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-8-5, there was nothing to suggest that she was not employed by the town and part of the union’s bargaining unit where the town code’s definition of classified personnel specifically included persons appointed or employed in the service of the town; the CBA, by reference to R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-9.4-2(b), provided that municipal employees were members of the bargaining unit under the agreement; and allowing the union to arbitrate the employee’s grievance did not infringe on the board’s authority to appoint clerical employees.

       Power of boards to administer oaths and subpoena evidence — Self-incrimination — False swearing.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The members of the local boards are severally authorized to administer oaths, and the boards, in all cases of every nature pending before them, are authorized and empowered to summon witnesses by subpoena signed by the clerk of those boards, and to compel these witnesses to attend and testify in the same manner as witnesses are compelled to appear and testify in any court; and the boards are authorized to compel the production of all papers, books, documents, records, certificates, or other legal evidence that may be necessary or proper for the determination and decision of any question or the discharge of any duty required by law of the boards, by issuing a subpoena duces tecum, signed by their clerk. Every person disobeying any subpoena shall be adjudged as in contempt, and the boards may punish any contempt of their authority in like manner as contempt may be punished by any court, and the boards may, at any meeting held for the purpose of canvassing the voting lists, examine under oath the person whose right to vote is disputed or any other person, and may receive any other evidence that the boards may deem necessary respecting the right of any person to have his or her name upon the registry or to vote, and shall decide upon the right. No evidence elicited in the examination shall be used against the person so examined in any criminal prosecution against him or her, except a prosecution for perjury in the examination. Any person who shall willfully swear falsely in any proceeding, matter, or hearing before the boards or any of them shall be guilty of a felony.

        _______________ , which is the date of the second general election following the date of this mailing, then your name may be removed from the voter registration list. If you have permanently changed residence address to another city or town in Rhode Island, please complete and return the
        completed voter registration form to the local board of canvassers in the city or town of your current address.

       If a confirmation notice is mailed to a voter and returned as undeliverable, or if delivered and the voter has not responded within fourteen (14) days from the date of the mailing, the voter shall remain on, or be placed on, the inactive list and shall not be permitted to vote until the voter has signed an affirmation form at either the approved polling place or at the local board of canvassers as provided in this chapter. Any application for a mail ballot under § 17-20-2.1 or an emergency mail ballot under § 17-20-2.2 shall serve as a proper affirmation form under this section if the address is the same as the voter’s current address on record with the board of canvassers. If the voter fails to vote by the second general election following the date of the confirmation mailing, then the voter shall be removed from the voting list. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, if the confirmation mailing was based upon the change of address information provided by or through the United States Postal Service National Change of Address Program, and the voter has failed to respond to the confirmation mailing, the voter shall remain on the active list of voters and shall not be required to sign the affirmation form. In these cases, the voter’s residence address for voting purposes will be changed by the local board to the new address as indicated by the National Change of Address Program.

       Any elector may challenge the registration of a registered voter by submitting to the local board an affidavit prescribed by the state board of elections in accordance with rules and regulations promulgated by the board stating that the voter is not eligible to vote and setting forth evidence that would create a reasonable cause to suspect that the challenged voter is not in fact eligible. The return as undeliverable of a mailing sent to the voter by someone other than the state board or local board shall not, standing alone, constitute reasonable cause. The local board, upon receipt of the affidavit and upon finding that the affidavit establishes reasonable cause, shall cause to be mailed, by certified mail, a notification of the challenge to the challenged voter at his or her registered address. The return of the notice or acknowledgement of its receipt may be admitted as evidence at the hearing. The challenged voter shall appear before the local board at a time and place to be determined by the local board. The objector shall also be notified of the hearing. If the board finds that the affidavit does set forth reasonable cause to suspect that the challenged voter is not eligible, the voter, upon taking the following oath or affirmation, shall answer pertinent questions as provided in this section, and any other questions necessary to establish his or her eligibility.
      </li>
      <li id="t17c9.1s17-9.1-28ol1b">

       Findings.  The legislature finds that:
       <ol>
        <li id="t17c9.2s17-9.2-2ol1a1">
         Voting is both a fundamental right and a civic duty. Restoring the right to vote strengthens our democracy by increasing voter participation and helps people who have completed their incarceration to reintegrate into society. Voting is an essential part of reassuming the duties of full citizenship.
        </li>
        <li id="t17c9.2s17-9.2-2ol1a2">
         Rhode Island is the only state in New England that denies the vote to people convicted of felonies, not only while they are in prison, but also while they are living in the community under the supervision of parole or probation officials.
        </li>
        <li id="t17c9.2s17-9.2-2ol1a3">
         As a result of this extended disfranchisement, Rhode Island deprives a greater proportion of its residents of voting rights than any other state in the region. More than fifteen thousand five hundred (15,500) Rhode Islanders have lost the right to vote because of a felony conviction. Of these, eighty-six percent (86%) are not in prison, they have either been released or their convictions did not result in actual incarceration. Rhode Island has the second highest rate of people on probation in the nation.
        </li>
        <li id="t17c9.2s17-9.2-2ol1a4">
         Criminal disfranchisement in Rhode Island has a disproportionate impact on minority communities. The rate of disfranchisement of African American voters is more than six (6) times the statewide rate. Hispanics lose the vote at more than 2.5 times the statewide average. One in five (5) black men and one in eleven (11) Hispanic men are barred from voting in Rhode Island. By denying so many the right to vote, criminal disfranchisement laws dilute the political power of entire minority communities. Because these communities are concentrated in cities, the urban vote is also suppressed, with the rate of disfranchisement in urban areas 3.5 times the rate in the rest of the state.
        </li>
        <li id="t17c9.2s17-9.2-2ol1a5">
         Extending disfranchisement beyond a person’s term of incarceration complicates the process of restoring the right to vote. Under current law, a person may regain that right when released from incarceration if no parole follows, when discharged from parole, or when probation is completed. This system requires the involvement of many government agencies in the restoration process. This bill would simplify restoration by making people eligible to vote once they have served their time in prison, thereby concentrating in the department of corrections the responsibility for initiating restoration of voting rights. A streamlined restoration process conserves government resources and saves taxpayer dollars.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t17c9.2s17-9.2-2ol1b">
       Purpose.  The purposes of this act are to strengthen democratic institutions by increasing participation in the voting process, to help people who have completed prison sentences to become productive members of society, and to streamline procedures for restoring their right to vote.

The local board shall notify each voter whose registration has been canceled by a notice addressed to the voter at the voter’s last known address, and a memorandum that the notice has been sent shall be maintained on file by the local board; provided, that failure to give or receive the notice shall not affect the cancellation of the voter’s registration.

The local board, upon receipt of the list of deceased persons from the secretary of state, or upon receipt of an affidavit of death on forms prescribed by the secretary of state, shall promptly purge its files of registration cards by removing the cards of each deceased elector and canceling the voter registration information of the deceased elector from the central voter registration system.

It shall give notice of the time and place of the meeting, for at least ten (10) days previous to it, by posting notices of the meeting in the same manner as required by this chapter for the posting of the preliminary list, and by publication once, at least ten (10) days previous to the meeting, in one or more newspapers having general circulation in the city or town.

No registration shall be cancelled or a voter’s right to vote be otherwise limited based upon a finding that the voter no longer resides within the city or town unless the voter has confirmed either in person or in writing that the voter no longer resides within the city or town or the board has received written evidence that the voter has registered to vote within another city or town or in another state.

       Division of towns and representative district into voting districts.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The local board of any city or town may, on or before the sixtieth (60th) day preceding any election, divide or redivide the city or town, or any representative district in the city or town, into voting districts. The local board of each city or town shall determine voting districts by geographical boundaries and by no other means. No voting district shall at any time comprise parts of two (2) or more wards. It shall be the duty of the board to divide the city or town, representative district, or ward, so that substantially not more than three thousand (3000) total eligible registered voters shall be served by the same polling place; provided, however, that any divisions conducted by the local board pursuant to this section shall not result in creating a polling place serving less than five hundred (500) total eligible registered voters, except when a polling place is located in a low-income or elderly residential development, or when it is caused by legislative district boundaries; and provided, further, that no existing polling place which is presently located in a low-income or elderly residential development shall be eliminated. Upon the establishment and approval of any polling place by the state board, changes to the polling place shall not be allowed until the next redistricting by the general assembly, unless the polling place becomes unavailable to the city or town, or no longer meets polling place minimum requirements as established by the state board, then the city or town may take the appropriate action to replace the polling place. A polling place may be located either within or without the voting district for which it is established; provided, that a polling place may be located outside the district only upon unanimous determination of the local board and subject to the approval of the state board that a suitable place is not available within the voting district.

        Plaintiffs, a Democratic town committee and a member of both the town committee and the representative district committee, lacked standing to complain that §§ 17-12-6 and 17-12-9 required an election for town committee every two years. The injury was de minimis, the state had a legitimate function in setting the time, place, and manner of elections, and almost all state legislative offices are elected every two years. The election of town committees every two years fits in with this election scheme. Charlestown Democratic Town Committee v. Connell,

        Plaintiffs, a Democratic town committee and a member of both the town committee and a representative district committee, lacked standing to claim that the state, by setting the number of members on district committees and receiving legislative candidate endorsements only from district committees, violated the First Amendment, because one disgruntled town committee, which could not change the internal workings of the democratic party, brought this suit against the wishes of the rest of the organization, because an individual party member or single party committee to maintain this type of action lacks standing, and because the Rhode Island Democratic state committee, the governing body of the Democratic party, vigorously opposed the present action and joined as an intervenor defendant.

        Plaintiffs, a town committee and a member of both the town committee and the representative district committee, lacked standing to complain that §§ 17-12-6 and 17-12-9 required an election for town committee every two years. The injury was de minimis, the state had a legitimate function in setting the time, place, and manner of elections, and almost all state legislative offices are elected every two years. The election of town committees every two years fits in with this election scheme. Charlestown Democratic Town Committee v. Connell,

        Plaintiffs, a Democratic town committee and a member of both the town committee and a representative district committee, lacked standing to claim that the state, by setting the number of members on district committees and receiving legislative candidate endorsements only from district committees, violated the First Amendment, because one disgruntled town committee, which could not change the internal workings of the democratic party, brought this suit against the wishes of the rest of the organization, because an individual party member or single party committee to maintain this type of action lacks standing, and because the Rhode Island Democratic state committee, the governing body of the Democratic party, vigorously opposed the present action and joined as an intervenor defendant.

        Subsection (a) is unduly vague and unconstitutional on its face because the definition of a “bona fide national candidate” fails to specify by whom a candidate must be generally recognized nationally, and fails to specify what a candidate must do in order to comply and, in attempting to comply, a candidate must necessarily guess at its meanings, and permits the secretary of state to exercise unreviewable discretion in her determination of candidacy.

        Subsection (a) is discriminatory and unconstitutional on its face because it draws a distinction between otherwise-valid candidates without a rational basis; a “bona fide national candidate” is given a preferred position over a candidate with only regional support, a “dark horse” candidate, a one-issue candidate, or a “favorite son” candidate, all of whom deserve ballot consideration on the same basis as any serious candidate.

        Subsection (b)(1) is unduly vague and unconstitutional on its face because it provides absolutely no standards for the state party chairman to follow in recommending candidates to the secretary of state. Duke v. Connell,

        Subsection (b)(2) is reasonably necessary to achieve the legitimate state interest of limiting ballot access to only those candidates who can demonstrate sufficient support and is nondiscriminatory because it burdens all candidates equally, regardless of their political views.

      Not all endorsers of a candidate need sign on the same nomination papers, but endorsers who are voters in different cities and towns shall not sign the same sheet. Every voter signing a nomination paper shall sign in person with his or her name, place of residence, and street number, as it appears on the voting list. The signature shall be accepted as valid if it can be reasonably identified to be the signature of the voter it purports to be. A variation of the voter’s signature by the insertion or omission of identifying titles or by the substitution of initials for the first or middle names, or both, shall not in itself be grounds for invalidation of the signature. Any voter who is unable to write may sign by making his or her mark “X” on the nomination paper in the presence of two (2) witnesses who shall subscribe their names on the paper as witnesses to the signing.

      Each nomination paper for party and independent candidates shall be submitted before four o’clock (4:00) p.m. on the sixtieth (60th) day before the primary to the local board of the city or town where the signers appear to be voters or, in the case of special elections, on the twenty-eighth (28th) day before the primary. Nomination papers for independent presidential candidates and presidential candidates of political parties, other than those defined in § 17-1-2(9), shall be filed not later than sixty (60) days prior to the general election. Each local board shall immediately proceed to check signatures on each nomination paper filed with it against the voting list as last canvassed or published according to law. The local boards shall certify a sufficient number of names appearing on the nomination papers that are in conformity with the requirements of § 17-14-8 to qualify the candidate for a position on the ballot, and after considering any challenge under this section and, if necessary, certifying any additional valid names, shall immediately file nomination papers for statewide office, general assembly, and state and district committee candidates with the secretary of state; provided, that nomination papers for local candidates shall be retained by the local board. If any candidate or the chairperson of any party committee questions the validity or authenticity of any signature on the nomination paper, the local board shall immediately and summarily decide the question, and for this purpose, shall have the same powers as are conferred upon the board by the provisions of § 17-14-14. If any challenged signature is found to be invalid, for any reason in law, or forged, then the signature shall not be counted.

      When nomination papers have been duly filed and are in apparent conformity with § 17-14-11, they shall be conclusively presumed to be valid, unless written objections to them are made as to the eligibility of the candidate or the sufficiency of the nomination papers or the signatures on them.

Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the secretary of state or the local board, as the case may be, from disqualifying a candidate based on the determination of the secretary of state or the local board, acting on its own motion, that the candidate is ineligible or the nomination papers or the signatures on them are invalid or insufficient.

     <p>
      The secretary of state shall immediately, upon receipt of the certificates provided for by chapter 14 of this title, cause the proper ballots to be prepared for use in the various voting districts. Names of party candidates for a particular office shall be printed vertically below the names of the office they seek and shall not appear on the ballot more than once for the same office; provided, the names of candidates having the endorsement of their party committees shall be printed first below the title of the offices they seek and shall be marked with an asterisk (*). As to each candidate, following the endorsed party candidate, for a national office, a general office within the state, or for a general assembly office, the names shall be listed in an order chosen by lot under the direction of the secretary of state. As to each candidate, following the endorsed party candidate, for a city, town, or other local election, the names shall be listed alphabetically after the name of the endorsed party candidate. In the event that there are more candidates for a particular office than the voting machine can accommodate in the vertical column, the names shall be continued in the same manner in the next succeeding vertical column. Names of candidates shall be printed upon the ballots as the names appear on the voting list, notwithstanding that the candidate may have signed his or her declaration of candidacy other than as the candidate’s name appears on the voting list.

        Though the state has a legitimate interest in the prevention of raiding, a 26-month restriction encompassing two primaries before a switch may be made in party affiliation was overly broad and was an infringement on the right to vote and the freedom of association as prescribed in the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.Yale v. Curvin,
        <cite class="ocri">

        The right to vote in a caucus is not guaranteed by the Constitution but is created by the legislature. In re Jamestown Caucus Law,

        Similar provision in Jamestown caucus law was constitutional even though it disqualified voters for acts prior to passage of the act. In re Jamestown Caucus Law,

        To the extent this section prohibits any otherwise eligible voter from voting in a party’s primary when the party’s bylaws would permit them to do so, it unconstitutionally infringes on the party’s members’ freedom of association. Cool Moose Party v. Rhode Island,

        By preventing a member of a political party that does not nominate candidates for federal office from voting as member of that party in the primary of another party that does nominate federal candidates, this section did not violate the qualifications clause of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const., Art.

        Where the state failed to articulate any legitimate interest for the restriction of this section on the ability of a party to invite registered voters from other parties to participate in its primary, the court affirmed the district court’s ruling that prohibiting such voters was unconstitutional to the extent that it prohibited them from voting in the primary of another party whose bylaws would permit their participation.

      If an optical scan precinct count unit becomes out of order, the warden shall notify the voting equipment technician assigned to respond to those calls. While repairing or otherwise attending to the repair of any voting machine equipment, the voting equipment technician shall display, in a visible manner and on his or her clothing, an identification furnished by the state board of elections, and which shall include, whenever possible, a photograph of the voting equipment technician. In the event that repairs are made to the voting equipment, the voting equipment technician shall make the repairs in the presence of a bi-partisan pair of election officials, and the technician shall note on the official document provided the nature and extent of the repairs made by the technician, the number of the optical scan precinct count unit, the time required to make the repairs, and the probable cause of the failure to operate properly. If any optical scan precinct count unit cannot be repaired by the technician within a period of thirty (30) minutes, the technician and the board shall at once substitute another optical scan precinct count unit for the out of order unit, and at the close of the polls the records of both units shall be taken. During the time in which the optical scan precinct count unit is not accepting ballots, the warden shall, in the presence of the clerk, unlock the emergency bin compartment of the optical scan unit and shall direct voters to place their voted ballots into that compartment. Upon the repair of the unit, the warden, in the presence of the clerk, shall remove the ballots, deposit them in the appropriate ballot slot for counting by the unit, and shall then close and lock the emergency compartment slot.

       Each person desiring to vote shall provide proof of identification as required by § 17-19-24.2 and state his or her name and residence, including that person’s street address, if he or she has any, to the pair of bi-partisan supervisors, who shall then announce the name and residence in a loud and distinct voice, clear and audible.
      </li>
      <li id="t17c19s17-19-24ol1b">
       A bipartisan pair shall locate the voter’s name on the certified voting list for the voting district. Upon finding the voter’s name on the certified voting list for the district, the voter shall sign their name on the line next to their printed name on the certified voter list, and the bipartisan pair shall initial the certified voter list in the place provided next to the voter’s signature entered on the certified list of voters. The bipartisan pair shall also make a proper notation on the certified voter list that the applicant has voted in the election. If the bipartisan pair cannot locate the voter’s name on the certified voting list for the voting district the bipartisan pair shall direct the voter to the clerk who shall review the certified list for the city or town and determine if the voter is registered to vote and in which voting district they are eligible to vote. The bipartisan pair of supervisors shall provide the voter with the appropriate computer ballot and security sleeve. The warden shall direct the voter to the voting booth which the voter shall use, and unless the voter needs instruction or assistance as provided in this chapter, the voter shall cast his or her vote, and if he or she desires place the voted computer ballot in a security sleeve, and shall proceed to the optical scan precinct count unit and shall personally place his or her voted ballot into the designated ballot slot on the unit, and after doing so, shall leave the enclosure at once. No voter shall remain within the voting booth longer than ten (10) minutes, and if the voter refuses to leave after the lapse of ten (10) minutes, the voter shall be removed from the voting booth by order of the warden. Except for the election officials and the election inspector, not more than two (2) voters in excess of the number of voting booths shall be permitted within the enclosed space at any time.
      </li>
      <li id="t17c19s17-19-24ol1c">
       The optical scan precinct count unit shall be programmed to return a ballot to the voter if the voter has cast votes for more persons than which he or she is entitled to cast. The warden, by reading the message given on the optical scan precinct count unit, must advise the voter of the fact that the ballot has been over-voted. The voter will be instructed by the warden to remove his or her own ballot from the optical scan precinct count unit ballot slot. The warden will then ask the voter to surrender the ballot as void and receive a new ballot. If the voter agrees, the voter will make additional marks on the ballot so as not to identify the actual votes intended by the voter for the ballot. The ballot will be marked void by the warden and deposited in the receptacle for void ballots provided at the polling place. If the voter insists on casting the over-voted ballot, he or she will be advised that all races, other than the over-voted race, will be counted by the optical scan precinct count unit, and if he or she still insists, the warden will manually override the appropriate control on the unit and allow for the ballot to be entered and counted for all races other than the over-voted race.
      </li>
      <li id="t17c19s17-19-24ol1d">
       In the event a voter incorrectly marks a ballot by indicating his or her choices other than in the spaces provided for them, the ballot will be returned to the voter. The warden, by reading the message given on the optical scan precinct count unit, must advise the voter of the fact that the ballot has been marked incorrectly. The voter will be instructed by the warden to remove his or her own ballot from the optical scan precinct unit ballot slot. The warden will then advise the voter to surrender the ballot as void and receive a new ballot. If the voter agrees, the voter will make additional marks on the ballot so as not to identify the actual votes intended by the voter for the ballot. The ballot will be marked void by the warden and deposited in the receptacle for void ballots provided at the polling place. The warden will then provide for the instruction of the voter on the correct manner of marking his or her vote and the voter will be issued a new ballot. If the voter insists on casting the incorrectly marked ballot, the warden will manually override the appropriate control on the optical scan precinct count unit and allow for the ballot to be accepted.

The bipartisan pair shall enter the voting booth with the voter and instruct the voter in the marking of his or her ballot, and if the voter has no further need of them, they shall both withdraw before the voter casts his or her vote. If, the voter is unable to mark his or her ballot, the bipartisan pair shall mark the ballot for the voter as he or she directs, but unless ordered to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction, neither member of the pair shall disclose for whom and how the voter voted. In every case of this nature, both members of the bipartisan pair shall enter and leave the voting booth together, and it shall be a violation of this chapter for either to enter or remain alone.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Ballots voted for any person whose name does not appear on the ballot as a nominated candidate for office are referred to in this section as “irregular ballots.” In voting for presidential electors, a voter may vote an irregular ticket made up of the names of persons in nomination by different parties; or partly of names of persons in nomination and partly of names of persons not in nomination; or wholly of names of persons not in nomination by any party. Scanned images of the computer ballot containing the irregular ballot shall be stored digitally on physical electronic media in the optical-scan precinct-count unit. With that exception, no irregular ballot shall be voted for any person for any office whose name appears on the ballot as a nominated candidate for that office; any irregular ballot so voted shall not be counted. An irregular ballot must be cast in its appropriate place on the ballot, or it shall be void and not counted and no irregular ballots shall be counted at primaries; provided, that at any presidential primary, irregular ballots shall be counted for those persons whose names have been written in for the office of president. At the close of the polls, irregular ballots shall be packaged according to § 17-19-33 and shall be immediately delivered to the local board of canvassers. The local board shall receive the tape from the optical precinct-count unit containing printed images of each written name on the irregular ballots, or the physical electronic media containing images of the irregular ballots and record all write-in votes cast for all federal, state, and local races listed on the tape. The local board shall notify the state board of the results through a procedure promulgated by the state board.

        The contestant in an election who seeks a new election because of the malfunction of a voting machine should not have to prove that the result would have been in fact different but for the malfunction. However, the contestant may not rely upon speculation to upset an election result. A happy balance is struck by requiring the contestant to show that the irregularities were sufficiently large in number to establish the probability that the result would be changed by a shift of or invalidation of the questioned votes.

Const., amend. 23 since annulled) in 1948 on absentee voting it was held that amendments to existing law after such adoption substantially implemented such constitutional provision by reenacting the prior statutory law by reference as against contention that existing law fell with the annulment of the previous constitutional provision, but it was further held that the statutory provisions were invalid insofar as they permitted voting before election day since R.I. Const., amend. 23 contained no provision authorizing the legislature to prescribe the time of voting by the absentees. Roberts v. Board of Elections,

      Those electors who are unable to vote in person at the polls for the reasons set forth in § 17-20-2 are entitled to vote in a manner which reasonably guarantees the secrecy of their ballots. The procedures set forth in this chapter are designed to promote the effective exercise of their rights while safeguarding those voters who utilize the mail ballot process from harassment, intimidation, and invasion of privacy. The procedures are intended to prevent misuse of the electoral system by persons who are not eligible to vote by mail ballot. The provisions of this chapter shall be interpreted to effectuate the policies set forth in this section.

Thereafter, the voter shall enclose and seal the ballot in the envelope provided for it. The voter shall then execute before the official or witnesses the certification on the envelope. The voter shall then enclose and seal the certified envelope with the ballot in the envelope addressed to the state board and cause the envelope to be delivered to the state board on or before election day.

     <p>
      The requirements set forth by this chapter controlling mail ballot eligibility and the procedure by which mail ballots are obtained and cast shall be strictly applied to assure the integrity of the electoral system. No mail ballot which was not obtained and/or cast in material conformance with the provisions of this title shall be certified by the board of elections. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 34-12-3 to the contrary, any mail ballot application or mail ballot certification notarized by a person who is not in fact a notary public or other officer authorized to administer oaths and take acknowledgements shall be void. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require the disqualification of a ballot merely because the elector did not sign the elector’s full name as it is listed on the voter registration list, but omitted or included a middle initial or name, abbreviated a first and/or middle name, or made a similar omission or inclusion, as long as the board of elections can reasonably determine the identity of the voter.

      The state board shall, at the completion of the count of all votes cast at any election, securely store all ballots cast in the election, and after the certification of the results of the elections, the state board shall place all ballots received from mail voters together with the certified envelopes containing the ballots in a steel box or package and shall seal the ballots and envelopes in open meetings of the board by affixing at least four (4) adhesive labels, and the members of the board shall sign the labels by affixing their signatures in ink to each of the labels, and thereafter no steel box or package shall upon any pretense be reopened by any person, except upon order of the general assembly or a court of competent jurisdiction, but shall be held by the board for twenty-two (22) months, when they may then be destroyed. The certified copies of the voting lists of mail voters and the applications referred to in § 17-20-10 shall likewise be safely sealed and kept by the board for the same length of time.

     <p>
      The sessions of the state board for the counting, canvassing, and tabulating provided for in § 17-22-1, and for the opening of the inner certifying envelopes containing mail ballots and for the counting, canvassing, and tabulating of these ballots, shall be public, but no notice or advertisement of these sessions needs to be given. The opening, counting, canvassing, and tabulating shall be done within a railed space in the room in which it takes place, and the board shall admit within the railed space the candidate, or at least one representative of the candidate, for whom votes are at the time being opened, counted, canvassed, or tabulated who may scrutinize the opening, count, canvass, and tabulation in accordance with the rules which may be adopted by the board. The board shall also admit to the opening, counting, canvassing, and tabulating an equal number of representatives of each political party who shall be party voters of the parties represented by them. These representatives, as well as the representatives of candidates, shall be authorized in writing by the chairperson of the state committees of their respective political parties or by the candidates whom they represent, as the case may be. Insofar as applicable, the procedures provided for in this chapter shall be followed by the local boards in the counting and tabulating of municipal mail ballots, except only that in these instances the representatives of political parties shall be appointed by the chairpersons of the city or town committees of their respective political parties. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to prevent the board from admitting, in its discretion, other persons and representatives of the press within the railed space during the opening, counting, canvassing, and tabulating.

        In examining the constitutionality of the Rhode Island Campaign Contributions and Expenditures Reporting Act, R.I. Gen.

        The Rhode Island Campaign Contributions and Expenditures Reporting Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-1 et seq., contains both a general severability clause, R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-17(a), and a clause stating that the application of any provision to ballot question referenda is severable from the application of that provision to candidate elections, R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-17(b). These clauses strongly suggest a legislative intent that, if any of the provisions of the Rhode Island Campaign Contributions and Expenditures Reporting Act are invalidated, the remaining provisions should be enforced.

        Subsection (a)(3) does not require corporations, profit or nonprofit, to establish political action committees for the purpose of making contributions and expenditures to influence the outcome of a ballot question, and, therefore, did not violate plaintiff corporations’ rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

        The “not acting in concert” limitation on expenditures in support of, or opposition to, ballot measures contained in R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-10(b) burdens the exercise of the right of political association by forcing individuals or groups who wish to coordinate their efforts with others to form a political action committee in order to make expenditures in furtherance of those efforts. It does not pass constitutional muster because it does not further any compelling state interest. R.I. Affiliate v. Begin,

        To the extent that they prohibit corporations or entities other than political action committees from making contributions from their own funds in order to support or oppose ballot measures, R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-10.1(h) and (j) are unconstitutional. R.I. Affiliate v. Begin,

        Disclosures required by R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-10(b) impose no great burden on the exercise of election-related speech. All that is required is the completion of a one-page form, which can be filled out and submitted to the Rhode Island Board of Elections online; this relatively small imposition serves the recognizably important government interest in providing the electorate with information as to where political campaign money comes from and how it is spent.

        Organization did not satisfy its burden of showing a likelihood of success on its First Amendment overbreadth challenge because (1) the campaign finance disclosures required by R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-10(b) imposed no great burden on the exercise of election-related speech; (2) the relatively small imposition served the recognizably important government interest in providing the electorate with information as to where political campaign money came from and how it was spent; and (3) the $100 threshold for the disclosure law was not wholly without rationality.

        The impact that the “not acting in concert” limitation on expenditures in support of or opposition to ballot measures contained in R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-10(b) has on First Amendment rights cannot be understood unless it is read together with R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-10(a). When considered in that context, the “not acting in concert” limitation fails the strict scrutiny test because it significantly infringes on First Amendment rights. R.I. Affiliate v. Begin,

        Rhode Island’s independent expenditure statute, R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-10(b), requires the reporting of expenditures aggregating over $100, made independently of a candidate, to support or defeat a candidate. In this context, the word “support” clearly sets forth the confines within which potential speakers must act in order to avoid triggering the provision. Nat'l Org. for Marriage v. Daluz,

        In the context of R.I. Gen.

        Eliminating the “not acting in concert” limitation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-10(b) with respect to expenditures for ballot issues does not create any loophole that would frustrate the State’s interest in public disclosure of the sources of political contributions. R.I. Affiliate v. Begin,

        Limitations on the amounts that may be contributed to political campaigns have only a “marginal” impact on a contributor’s freedom of expression because the expression involved in contributing does not increase perceptibly with the size of the contribution. However, there are circumstances under which contribution limits may have a direct and substantial impact on a contributor’s freedom of political association. Driver v. Distefano,

        In a declaratory judgment suit brought by a political party and a gubernatorial campaign against the State Board of Elections seeking to stop the Board from investigating a violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-10.1, the trial court clearly erred by holding that the Board was required to adopt rules and regulations relevant to its regulatory powers before it could investigate complaints.

        In a declaratory judgment suit brought by a political party and a gubernatorial campaign against the State Board of Elections seeking to stop the Board from investigating a violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-10.1, the trial court clearly erred by holding that the Board was required to adopt rules and regulations relevant to its regulatory powers before it could investigate complaints. However, since so much time had passed, and the available remedy was so nominal, the case no longer presented a sufficiently genuine case or controversy to warrant further review. R.I.

        This section, by mandating public revelation of all Political Action Committee contributors, burdens the rights of individuals to band together for the purpose of making either independent election expenditures or direct political contributions, and, by imposing this burden on PACs and PAC contributors while regulating candidates and their financial backers (viz., individuals who contribute directly to candidates rather than to PACs) more loosely, the statute compounds the unfairness of the burden. Finally, the disparity between the two disclosure thresholds (one for PACs and the other for individuals), and, hence, the net burden imposed solely on associational rights, bears no substantial relation to the attainment of any important state interest. Their cumulative effect compels the conclusion that the statute abridges the first amendment. Vote Choice v. DiStefano,

        The Rhode Island Campaign Contributions and Expenditures Reporting Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-1 et seq., contains both a general severability clause, R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-17(a), and a clause stating that the application of any provision to ballot question referenda is severable from the application of that provision to candidate elections, R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-17(b). These clauses strongly suggest a legislative intent that, if any of the provisions of the Rhode Island Campaign Contributions and Expenditures Reporting Act are invalidated, the remaining provisions should be enforced.

Gen. Laws § 17-25-10.1, the trial court clearly erred by holding that the Board was required to adopt rules and regulations relevant to its regulatory powers before it could investigate complaints. However, since so much time had passed, and the available remedy was so nominal, the case no longer presented a sufficiently genuine case or controversy to warrant further review. R.I.

      The general assembly finds that persons attempting to escape from actual or threatened domestic violence frequently establish new addresses in order to prevent their assailants or probable assailants from finding them. The purpose of this chapter is to enable victims of domestic violence and members of their household to participate in the electoral process by providing address confidentiality.
