     </h3>
     <p>
      Milk is recognized to be one of the most perfect foods afforded by nature. It is unique in that its consumption in adequate quantities is essential to the nutritional well-being of the individual; but if its production and distribution are not properly safeguarded, it may be instrumental in the transmission of diseases infectious to people. It is declared to be the policy of the state that, for the protection of the health and welfare of the people of the state of Rhode Island, the environmental conditions surrounding the production, handling, transportation, distribution, and sale of milk and milk products shall be to protect the public health and to provide consumers with products that are identified in such a way as to promote honesty and fair dealing in the best interests of the consumers. Specifically, it is declared to be the policy of the state to provide:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t21c02s21-2-2ol11">
       That the people of Rhode Island shall have a supply of milk adequate to their needs and demands under all conditions.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c02s21-2-2ol12">
       That milk provided for consumers within the state of Rhode Island shall be of good quality; shall be safe for human consumption; shall contain no live bacteria capable of transmitting disease to people; shall contain adequate nutritional components; and shall be free of adulteration.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c02s21-2-2ol13">
       That milk sold or produced in Rhode Island shall come from healthy cows or goats.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c02s21-2-2ol14">
       That milk sold or produced in Rhode Island shall be produced on farms having standards and conditions of sanitation adequate to ensure production of milk that is safe and of good quality.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c02s21-2-2ol15">
       That milk sold or produced in Rhode Island shall be produced, processed, and handled by personnel free from any communicable disease.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c02s21-2-2ol16">
       That milk to be consumed in the state of Rhode Island shall, at all stages in its travel from animal to ultimate consumer, be transported in equipment and/or packages that shall be designed, filled, operated, maintained, and emptied to prevent the introduction and/or propagation of bacteria, dirt, or any other foreign substances.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c02s21-2-2ol17">
       That all milk sold in Rhode Island shall be handled and processed under conditions of good sanitation and shall be finally packaged free from contamination, dirt, or any other foreign substances and/or adulteration.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c02s21-2-2ol18">
       That all milk sold within the state of Rhode Island shall be, except as specifically authorized by this chapter, pasteurized by a recognized method of pasteurizing adequate to destroy bacteria capable of transmitting disease to people. Provided, that a physician may authorize an individual sale of goat milk directly from producer to consumer by written, signed prescription.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c02s21-2-2ol19">
       That the branding or labeling of packages in which all milk sold in the state of Rhode Island shall be delivered to the consumer shall state the grade of milk packaged; may state any special attributes of the milk; and that all statements made on any packaging labels shall not be false or misleading.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c02s21-2-2ol110">
       That this state shall cooperate in the preparation and promulgation of any set of standards, regulations, statutes, or other means of control of sanitation in the production, transportation, handling, processing, and distribution of milk, or any one or more of them, according to a uniform system of requirements to be adopted alike by all or a majority of the states that contribute milk to the Rhode Island market.

      In the event that any permittee shall be deemed by the director to have violated any of the provisions of this chapter, or of the regulations promulgated under this chapter, or of the terms of § 21-4.1-6, he or she may, in his or her discretion, initiate proceedings for the revocation of the permit of the permittee. The director shall give the permittee twenty (20) days’ written notice of a hearing at which the permittee shall be given opportunity to show cause as to why his or her permit shall not be revoked. The director may, at the hearing, have the assistance of counsel in ruling upon evidence and in connection with the conduct of the hearing, or, in the alternative, the hearing may be conducted by a subordinate designated by the director for that purpose, who shall take a written record of the proceedings by a competent court stenographer, and the director may decide the issues arising at the hearing upon the basis of the written record. Any decision on the revocation of any permit shall be made by the director in writing by filing his or her written decision containing his or her findings of fact and conclusions in his or her office and serving a copy by registered or certified mail of his or her decision in the matter on the permittee.

     <p>
      In addition to any other remedy set forth in this chapter for the enforcement of the provisions of the chapter or any rule, regulation, order, or decision of the director, the superior court shall have jurisdiction in equity, upon a bill of complaint filed by the director or his or her authorized agents, to restrain or enjoin any person, his or her agents, and servants, from committing any act prohibited by this chapter or prohibited by any lawful rule, regulation, order, or decision of the director. If it is established upon hearing that any person charged, himself or herself or by his or her agents and servants, has been or is committing any act declared to be unlawful by this chapter or is in violation of any rule, regulation, order, and decision of the director, the court shall enter a decree enjoining that person, corporation, or trustee from further commission of that act or actions. In case of violation of an injunction issued under this section, the court or any judge of the court shall summarily try and punish the person, or his or her agents and servants, or both, for contempt of court. The existence of other civil or criminal remedies shall be no defense to this proceeding. The director, or his or her authorized agents, shall not be required in that proceeding to give or post a bond when making an application for an injunction, a restraining order, preliminary injunction, or permanent injunction under this section. The court may issue an ex parte restraining order, until further hearing, upon a reasonable showing ex parte that the respondent has been guilty of a violation, and shall have power to enter preliminary injunctions and grant other relief, pendente lite, which may pertain to equity and justice in the premises. All proceedings under this section, and any appellate proceedings which may follow, shall in all respects follow the course of equity.

      It shall be unlawful for any person to directly or indirectly manufacture, sell, distribute, receive for distribution, or hold in his or her possession or control any frozen dessert or frozen dessert mix for distribution, sale, or resale without first obtaining a license to do so from the director of health. Application for a license shall be filed with the director of health on forms prescribed and furnished by the director. The application shall include, among other things, the location of each plant at which frozen desserts and/or frozen dessert mixes are to be manufactured into a form for distribution, sale, or resale and the brand name or names, if any, under which they are to be distributed, sold, or resold. In order to set the license renewal dates so that all activities for each establishment can be combined on one license instead of on several licenses, the department of health shall set the license renewal date. The license period shall be for twelve (12) months, commencing on the license renewal date, and the license fee shall be at the full annual rate regardless of the date of application or the date of issuance of license. If the license renewal date is changed, the department may make an adjustment to the fees of licensed establishments, not to exceed the annual license fee, in order to implement the change in license renewal date.

     <p>
      The director of health shall, upon receipt of application for a license to operate an establishment for any or all of the purposes mentioned in § 21-11-3, cause that establishment to be inspected and, if it is found to conform to the provisions of this chapter and the regulations adopted in accordance with this chapter, shall issue a license upon receipt of a fee as set forth in § 23-1-54; provided, that the license fee shall be at a reduced rate, as also set forth in § 23-1-54, for any one establishment where: (1) the meat is sold only at retail, (2) no slaughtering is performed, and (3) no more than one of the activities described in § 21-11-3 for which a license is required is performed. In order to set the license renewal dates so that all activities for each establishment can be combined on one license instead of on several licenses, the department of health shall set the license renewal date. The license period shall be for twelve (12) months, commencing on the license renewal date, and the license fee shall be at the full annual rate regardless of the date of application or the date of issuance of license. If the license renewal date is changed, the department may make an adjustment to the fees of licensed establishments, not to exceed the annual license fee, in order to implement the change in license renewal date. Applications for renewal of licenses, accompanied by the prescribed fee, shall be submitted at least two (2) weeks before the renewal date. Licenses issued or renewed under this section may be suspended or revoked for failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter or the regulations adopted in accordance with this chapter.

     <p>
      No person shall conduct within this state any shellfish business until that person shall have obtained a license from the department. The director shall, upon receipt of application for a license to conduct a shellfish business, cause the applicant’s shellfish business facilities to be investigated and, if they are found to comply with the provisions of this chapter and the regulations adopted in accordance with this chapter, shall issue a license upon receipt of a fee for a shipper/reshipper or for a shucker packer/repacker as set forth in § 23-1-54. Any license issued shall apply only to those phases of the shellfish business that appear on the license and are defined by the director in regulations he or she shall adopt in regard to licensing. In order to set the license renewal dates so that all activities for each establishment can be combined on one license instead of on several licenses, the department of health shall set the license renewal date. The license period shall be for twelve (12) months, unless sooner suspended or revoked for cause, commencing on the license renewal date, and the license fee shall be at the full annual rate regardless of the date of application or the date of issuance of license. If the license renewal date is changed, the department may make an adjustment to the fees of licensed establishments, not to exceed the annual license fee, in order to implement the change in license renewal date. Licenses issued pursuant to this section may be suspended or revoked for violation of the provisions of this chapter or the regulations adopted in accordance with this chapter. The director may, after a hearing, refuse to issue any shellfish business license to any person who has been convicted of any violation of this chapter.

       When “chapter 1” first appeared as a reference in this section, such chapter 1 contained the law relating to the adulteration and misbranding of food and drugs which was originally enacted by
       <cite class="ocri">
        P.L. 1908
       </cite>
       , ch. 1597. Public Laws 1959, ch. 56, enacted the Food, Drugs, and Cosmetics Act as chapter 31, superseding, for the most part, chapter 1 but making no mention of such chapter 1. Public Laws 1963, ch. 164, then amended chapter 1 so as to change the subject matter of such chapter to relate to frozen food products. Therefore, it may be that the reference to chapter 1 in this section should actually be a reference to chapter 31.

      Blank forms of the application for permits shall be furnished by the department without cost. The fee for the permit shall be as set forth in § 23-1-54. The fee for a permit to manufacture or bottle apple cider shall also be as set forth in § 23-1-54. In order to set the license renewal dates so that all activities for each establishment can be combined on one license instead of on several licenses, the department of health shall set the license renewal date. The license period shall be for twelve (12) months, commencing on the license renewal date, and the license fee shall be at the full annual rate regardless of the date of application or the date of issuance of license. If the license renewal date is changed, the department may make an adjustment to the fees of licensed establishments, not to exceed the annual license fee, in order to implement the change in license renewal date. Any person applying for a permit to bottle or manufacture apple cider shall certify that he or she does not manufacture or bottle any carbonated or nonalcoholic beverage, soda water, fruit juice, syrup, bottled drinking water, either plain or carbonated, or any other so-called soft drink, other than apple cider. The fee received by the department for “bottlers’ permits” shall be turned over to the general treasurer. All permits granted under this chapter shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises of the bottler so that they may readily be seen by any person inspecting the premises; provided that the fees so far as they relate to cider, shall not apply to any person who manufactures and bottles during any one calendar year not exceeding five hundred (500) gallons of cider.

     <p>
      All bakery products, cereal flours, and related products regulations and any amendments to them adopted by the federal government pursuant to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, CFR 21, Parts 136, entitled “Bakery Products,” and 137, entitled “Cereal Flours and Related Products,” are the regulations in this state. The department may by regulation provide for modification or deviation from these regulations where the interest of Rhode Island consumers may warrant, whether or not the modifications or deviations are in accordance with the regulations adopted pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,

      § 301 et seq.; provided, the amendments do not interfere with interstate commerce. A federal regulation automatically adopted pursuant to this chapter takes effect in this state on the date it becomes effective as a federal regulation. The director shall publish a notice of the adoption in a newspaper having general circulation throughout the state. A person who may be adversely affected by a regulation may, within thirty (30) days after a federal regulation is automatically adopted, file with the director, in writing, objections and a request for a hearing. The timely filing of substantial objections to a federal regulation automatically adopted stays the effect of the regulation. If no substantial objections are received and no hearing is requested within thirty (30) days after publication of a notice of the adoption of a federal regulation, it shall be effective as of the date it was adopted by the federal government. If timely substantial objections are made to a federal regulation within thirty (30) days after it is automatically adopted, the director, after notice, shall conduct a public hearing in accordance with the provisions of chapter 35 of title 42. The director of health is authorized to adopt any regulations for bakery products, cereal flours, and related products that he or she deems necessary in accordance with authority granted under this chapter, chapter 31 of this title, chapter 27 of this title, and § 23-1-18(5).

         Sufficient evidence supported defendant’s conviction for manufacturing and cultivating marijuana, as defined in R.I. Gen. Laws § 21-28-1.02, because testimony by a witness, who entered into a cooperation agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, placed defendant at various meetings where the operation and its profits were discussed, defendant participated in the planning and preparation for the grow operation at the rented property, received money from the witness for rent and equipment, managed the rent and utility payments while the operation was ongoing, and evidence seized from the rented property demonstrated defendant’s connection to the property; thus, the trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal, R.I.

         The only discretion allowed the director of health pursuant to subsection (c) of this section is the authority to object to the action of the federal government in designating, rescheduling, or deleting a controlled substance. State v. Peloquin,

         In reading subsection (c) of this section, it is clear that upon publication in the federal register of a final order designating, rescheduling, or deleting a substance as a controlled substance, the director of health must similarly control the substance as a matter of Rhode Island law.

        </h5>
        <p>
         The phrase “each party to the transaction” conveys an unambiguous and reasonable meaning when read in relation to the persons described in the first two sentences of this section. State v. Udin,
         <cite class="ocri">
          419 A.2d 251
         </cite>
         ,

         (R.I. 1980).
        </p>
        <p>
         The person giving an official written order and the person who accepts that order constitute “each party to the transaction” upon whom this section imposes a record-keeping requirement. State v. Udin,
         <cite class="ocri">
          419 A.2d 251
         </cite>
         ,

         (R.I. 1980).
        </p>
        <p>
         The ultimate determination of whether a defendant is a “party to the transaction” depends upon resolution of the issue of whether he was the person giving the official written orders within the meaning of this section. State v. Udin,
         <cite class="ocri">
          419 A.2d 251
         </cite>
         ,
         <cite class="ocri">
          1980 R.I. LEXIS 1728
         </cite>
         (R.I. 1980).
        </p>
        <p>
         The essential factual finding in connection with deciding who is a party to the transaction for purposes of this section depended, under the circumstances of this case, upon determining who was listed as the registrant on the order forms in issue. State v. Udin,
         <cite class="ocri">
          419 A.2d 251
         </cite>
         ,
         <cite class="ocri">

         (R.I. 1980).
        </p>
        <p>
         The registrant named on the order form is a party to the transaction required by this section to preserve copies of accepted orders. State v. Udin,
         <cite class="ocri">
          419 A.2d 251
         </cite>

        </p>
        <p>
         The person described in this section as the one giving an official written order is the person who is named as the registrant on each order form. State v. Udin,
         <cite class="ocri">
          419 A.2d 251
         </cite>
         ,

         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         A defendant’s liability under this section hinges on whether he was the registrant named on the order forms or, if he was not the registrant, whether he occupied a position in relation to the registrant by which position the registrant’s failure to preserve order forms would be imputed to him. State v. Udin,
         <cite class="ocri">

         The requirement in the second sentence of this section is imposed on the person giving the official written order. State v. Udin,
         <cite class="ocri">
          419 A.2d 251
         </cite>

         (R.I. 1980).
        </p>
        <p>
         The language “person giving the order” must be construed narrowly because failure to comply with the record-keeping requirement of this section may under § 21-28-4.02 result in the imposition of penal sanctions. State v. Udin,
         <cite class="ocri">
          419 A.2d 251
         </cite>
         ,

         (R.I. 1980).
        </p>
        <p>
         The first sentence of this section indicates that the person giving an official written order is, under this section, distinct from a duly authorized agent who signs the order. Thus, an agent who signs an order is not the person giving the order. State v. Udin,

         The defense of entrapment requires a showing that the criminal conduct was the product of the creative activity of law-enforcement officials, and where it was shown by substantial, overwhelming evidence that the defendant was a willing and voluntary participant in the drug activities for which he was indicted, the State had not “manufactured” the crime and the defense of entrapment would not stand.

         By raising the defense of entrapment, the defendant put in issue his predisposition to sell and possess drugs, and the state was entitled to show, by evidence of defendant’s voluntary participation in other drug sales, the state of mind of the defendant, and that the undercover drug operation had trapped an “unwary criminal,” not an “unwary innocent.” State v.

         When the defendant introduces sufficient evidence of inducement to raise the question of entrapment but the state adduces no evidence of predisposition in rebuttal, the trial justice must find as a matter of law that entrapment has occurred. However, if the state introduces evidence of defendant’s predisposition, the jury must resolve the question of entrapment. State v. Jones,

        <p>
         Predisposition should be proven by reliable and probative evidence. For evidence to be reliable and probative, it must have a direct bearing on whether defendant was of a disposition that readily responds to inducement by government agents or informers at the time he was subjected to the inducement.

         Although an undercover police officer supplied the money to purchase marijuana, where it was the defendant who first suggested purchasing drugs, who made the travel arrangements and the initial contact with the dealer, and who contracted for the purchase of marijuana, delivered the money to the dealer, and, after delivery, brought the undercover officer to see the marijuana, the police conduct was not so “outrageous” as to prove entrapment.

         First-degree felony murder convictions of defendants were reversed since the trial court erred by denying defendants’ motion for a judgment of acquittal; their proven attempt to acquire a large amount of a controlled substance ($43,000 worth), without some further act directed at delivery or distribution of the contraband, did not satisfy the substantial step required to constitute attempted distribution or delivery to support a conviction under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-1. R.I. Gen. Laws § 21-284.01(a)(1) criminalized possession with intent to manufacture or deliver, whereas R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-1 omitted any reference to possession with intent to deliver and instead incorporated the language referring to a sale or other distribution, which was not the offense defendants’ felony-murder charge was predicated upon.

         Defendant’s presence in the car and his statements to the officer, the large quantity of heroin discovered, the relationship between the defendant and the driver of the car, their travel itinerary, and the physical evidence as it related to the car collectively gave rise to a strong inference that defendant traveled to New York with his girlfriend in order to assist her in transporting a large shipment of heroin back to Rhode Island. From the totality of the circumstances the jury could infer that defendant had constructively possessed the heroin even though the heroin was in the trunk and occupants had no key to the trunk.

         In a prosecution for possession of marijuana, evidence of the defendant’s alleged cocaine involvement may have been prejudicial to the defendant; however, the probative value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect where the defendant’s proposed means of obtaining the money to pay for the marijuana was through the sale of cocaine.

         In a delivery of a controlled substance case, the testimony at trial indicated that a surveillance detective observed an exchange of cocaine for money between a buyer and defendant; later, the surveillance detective seized what tested to be cocaine from the buyer’s truck. Shortly thereafter, defendant was apprehended sitting in the same green car, parked in the same location as the purveyor of the suspected narcotics and made incriminating statements; with those facts in the record as a basis that defendant delivered a controlled substance, the trial justice was not clearly wrong did not overlook material evidence in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial. State v. Castro,
         <cite class="ocri">

        </p>
        <p>
         In a prosecution for possession of marijuana with intent to deliver, defendant’s counsel was not ineffective for not discovering that a toxicology report was erroneous; but, even if counsel were, defendant was not prejudiced, since a factual basis existed for defendant’s nolo contendere plea even in the absence of the report. Moniz v. State,
         <cite class="ocri">
          933 A.2d 691

         (R.I. 2007).
        </p>
        <p>
         Because the record was replete with evidence that defendant knew there was cocaine in the bags that defendant tossed under a cooperating witness’s car and/or were seized from defendant’s automobile, and because the intent to deliver could be inferred from the quantity of cocaine seized, defendant was properly convicted of possessing cocaine with an intent to deliver; thus, defendant’s R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 29 motion for a judgment of acquittal was properly denied. State v. Rodriguez,

         Evidence that an individual approached defendant in a rushed manner, handed him currency, and received something from defendant in return, and that the transaction took place in an area known for drug trafficking and the individual was apprehended minutes later with a small bag of cocaine in his pocket was sufficient to support a reasonable jury finding defendant guilty of delivery of a controlled substance, cocaine, in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 21-28-4.01(a)(4)(i). State v. Vargas,

Gen. Laws tit. 21, ch. 28, were vacated. As the evidence was insufficient to prove he knew of and intended to exercise control over cocaine found in his passengers’ purses, the evidence did not support the inference that he agreed with them to traffic in drugs.

         Sufficient evidence supported defendant’s conviction for manufacturing and cultivating marijuana, R.I. Gen. Laws § 21-28-4.01(a)(1) and (4)(i), because testimony by a witness, who entered into a cooperation agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, placed defendant at various meetings where the operation and its profits were discussed, defendant participated in the planning and preparation for the grow operation at the rented property, received money from the witness for rent and equipment, managed the rent and utility payments while the operation was ongoing, and evidence seized from the rented property demonstrated defendant’s connection to the property; thus, the trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal, R.I.

         First-degree felony murder convictions of defendants were reversed since the trial court erred by denying defendants’ motion for a judgment of acquittal; their proven attempt to acquire a large amount of a controlled substance ($43,000 worth), without some further act directed at delivery or distribution of the contraband, did not satisfy the substantial step required to constitute attempted distribution or delivery to support a conviction under R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-1. R.I. Gen. Laws § 21-284.01(a)(1) criminalized possession with intent to manufacture or deliver, whereas R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-23-1 omitted any reference to possession with intent to deliver and instead incorporated the language referring to a sale or other distribution, which was not the offense defendants’ felony-murder charge was predicated upon.

         Despite the fact that a small amount of cocaine was found on defendant, the trial court properly denied defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal on charges of possession with intent to deliver cocaine and heroin, as the State presented evidence that the cocaine was individually packaged and that the buyer and defendant had an existing buyer-seller relationship that included the delivery of cocaine.

         Trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal as he intended to deliver the cocaine found in his possession because a law enforcement officer testified that, on approximately 15 occasions in less than a two-month period, he had observed defendant visiting an apartment that had been under investigation for selling narcotics; the exhibits presented at trial included a digital scale, and nine clear plastic bags containing cocaine that had been seized from defendant’s residence; an expert witness testified that the total weight of the cocaine seized was 33.43 grams; and approximately $3,300 worth of cocaine was seized from defendant and his residence.

         Where defendant, in a previous conviction, admitted to conspiring to violate the Rhode Island Uniform Controlled Substances Act by agreeing to possess, with intent to deliver, an amount of cocaine, the state conviction was a “serious drug offense” within the meaning of

         The Legislature intended the words “common nuisance” as used in subsection (2)(a) (now (b)(1)) to have their common-law meaning and such meaning contemplates acts which are recurrent or of an habitual nature. State v. Reis,

         Since the lesser included offense of possession of a controlled substance requires guilty knowledge of “conscious possession”, a conviction on an indictment charging delivery of the controlled substance also requires proof of such a general intent. Sharbuno v. Moran,

         This subsection establishes a strict liability standard of guilt for administering or giving a controlled substance and no specific intent need be shown. Thus a mother who had given methadone to her daughter was criminally liable under this statute. State v. Taylor,

         When there is clear evidence that a defendant has possession and control of a substantial cache of drugs from which he delivers quantities in a series of sales or transfers, he clearly could be tried and sentenced for both possession and delivery. State v. Ahmadjian,

         Since the evidence demonstrated that defendant was charged with conspiring with the individual to deliver cocaine to the detective, the conspiratorial agreement was a distinct and chargeable offense from the delivery count; thus, the trial court properly denied the motion for acquittal.

         Where defendant, in a previous conviction, admitted to conspiring to violate the Rhode Island Uniform Controlled Substances Act by agreeing to possess, with intent to deliver, an amount of cocaine, the state conviction was a “serious drug offense” within the meaning of

         An attempt to collect property through civil forfeiture proceedings must be remedial; the state cannot collect a sum or compel forfeiture of an object whose value exceeds the remedial limit. In considering the amount that might be within the remedial limit, the trial court may consider the cost of apprehending and prosecuting each individual defendant as well as the cost in these cases of probationary supervision during the terms of probation imposed. The state may not consider the cost of combating the drug traffic as a whole but only those costs that relate to the particular case at issue. State v. One Lot of $8,560 in United States Currrency,

         A defendant who already has been punished in a criminal prosecution may not be subjected to an additional civil sanction to the extent that the second sanction may not be fairly characterized as remedial but only as a deterrent or retribution.

         An attempt to collect property through civil forfeiture proceedings must be remedial; the state cannot collect a sum or compel forfeiture of an object whose value exceeds the remedial limit. In considering the amount that might be within the remedial limit, the trial court may consider the cost of apprehending and prosecuting each individual defendant as well as the cost in these cases of probationary supervision during the terms of probation imposed. The state may not consider the cost of combating the drug traffic as a whole but only those costs that relate to the particular case at issue. State v. One Lot of $8,560 in United States Currrency,

          Burden of Proving Illegal Connection.
         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         The burden of establishing a substantial and instrumental connection with illegal behavior must lie with the party claiming the forfeiture. United States v. Jenison,
         <cite class="ocri">
          484 F. Supp. 747
         </cite>
         ,
         <cite class="ocri">
          1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9846
         </cite>
         (D.R.I. 1980).
        </p>
        <p>
         The government has the burden of proving the direct derivation of money as contraband by a preponderance of the evidence. United States v. Jenison,
         <cite class="ocri">
          484 F. Supp. 747
         </cite>
         ,
         <cite class="ocri">
          1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9846
         </cite>
         (D.R.I. 1980).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where defendant’s arrest has not led to conviction on any charge, and the city has failed to show that there are any indictments pending against him that directly involve the seized funds, the city has not established a substantial and instrumental relationship between the money seized and illegal behavior by a preponderance of the evidence. United States v. Jenison,
         <cite class="ocri">
          484 F. Supp. 747
         </cite>
         ,
         <cite class="ocri">
          1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9846
         </cite>
         (D.R.I. 1980).
        </p>
        <p>
         The fact that defendant was observed knocking on the door of a motel room in which illegal drugs had recently been confiscated is simply not sufficient evidence to support the city’s conclusion that “defendant was linked to a large scale marijuana smuggling operation and the large amounts of money he was carrying had been used or were to be used in the purchase or sale of a controlled substance”. United States v. Jenison,
         <cite class="ocri">
          484 F. Supp. 747
         </cite>
         ,

        <p>
         Because forfeitures of property are drastic remedies, forfeiture statutes are strictly construed against forfeiture and in favor of the person whose rights are affected. United States v. Jenison,
         <cite class="ocri">
          484 F. Supp. 747
         </cite>
         ,

        </p>
        <p>
         Forfeitures are not punishment for criminal activity, but rather an exercise of the police power of a state to confiscate property that was instrumental in a crime so as to prevent the continuance of unlawful acts. United States v. Jenison,
         <cite class="ocri">
          484 F. Supp. 747
         </cite>
         ,

        <p>
         Though some articles such as counterfeit money, narcotics, or dangerous weapons are contraband by their very nature, other articles, such as large sums of money, acquire that status only if their possession or receipt is substantially and instrumentally related to illegal behavior. United States v. Jenison,
         <cite class="ocri">
          484 F. Supp. 747
         </cite>
         ,

        </p>
        <p>
         The fact that money is not specifically included in the detailed listing of items subject to forfeiture in this section is not dispositive. United States v. Jenison,
         <cite class="ocri">
          484 F. Supp. 747
         </cite>
         ,

        </p>
        <p>
         Under certain circumstances money is subject to seizure and forfeiture, the primary circumstance being when the money is the “fruit of crime” — that is, derivative contraband. United States v. Jenison,
         <cite class="ocri">
          484 F. Supp. 747
         </cite>
         ,

         Money proceeds cannot be seized unless they are directly derived from and directly traceable to the sale of a controlled substance. United States v. Jenison,

     <ol>
      <li id="t21c28.2s21-28.2-3ol11">
       Except as provided in this section, whenever any narcotic addict desires to obtain treatment for his or her addiction, whenever a related individual has reason to believe that any person is a narcotic addict, or whenever the director of health has reason to believe that any person is a narcotic addict, the addict, related individual, or director of health may apply for an order certifying that person to the care and custody of the department by presenting a verified petition setting forth knowledge, information, or belief that the person is a narcotic addict, together with a statement of the facts upon which that knowledge, information, or belief is based. When the petition is presented, the court may examine the petitioner, or any witness, under oath and shall determine whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person in whose behalf the application is made is a narcotic addict. If the court determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person is a narcotic addict, and if the person is not also the petitioner, it shall issue an order in accordance with subdivision (2) of this section; provided, that if the court determines that the person would not comply with the order the court shall issue, in lieu of an order, a warrant in accordance with subdivision (3) of this section. When the alleged addict is the petitioner and the court determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person is a narcotic addict, the court shall immediately proceed in accordance with subdivision (4) of this section. The state shall be a party in all proceedings pursuant to this section and shall act on the relation of the petitioner. The attorney general shall represent the state.

      <li id="t21c28.2s21-28.2-3ol12">
       An order issued pursuant to this section shall direct the alleged narcotic addict to appear at a specified time before the court for a determination whether there are reasonable grounds to order that person to undergo a medical examination at a facility or by two (2) physicians designated by the director.

      Upon demand by the alleged narcotic addict or anyone on his or her behalf, the court shall, or it may upon its own motion, issue an order directing the hearing of the application before the court unless the alleged addict requests a hearing before a jury. If the proceeding is in the district court, upon request, the matter shall be transferred to the superior court for the hearing and determination. The order shall be served upon the parties interested in the application and upon any other person that the court, in its discretion, may name. If the alleged addict elects a hearing before the court, he or she shall not be entitled to a jury trial. If a jury is requested, it shall be held in accordance with the rules of the superior court. At the time and place designated for the hearing by the appropriate court, it and the jury, if requested, shall proceed to hear the testimony introduced for and against the application, and the alleged narcotic addict may be examined, if deemed advisable. The court may issue subpoenas for attendance of witnesses at the hearing or trial and the alleged narcotic addict shall have the right to have subpoenas issued for this purpose. At the hearing or trial the alleged narcotic addict shall have the right to be represented by counsel, to present witnesses on his or her behalf, and to cross-examine witnesses. For purposes of this section, in a proceeding in which the alleged addict’s spouse is the petitioner, no communication made by the alleged addict to the spouse shall be deemed confidential within the provision of the general laws relating to confidential communications between husband and wife. If, from the facts ascertained upon the hearing, the proofs produced, the petition, and the report of the medical examination, the jury or, if there is no jury, the court, shall determine that the person is a narcotic addict, the court shall immediately issue an order certifying that person to the care and custody of the department for the period provided in § 21-28.2-8, provided that facilities are available.

Laws tit. 21, ch. 28.6, of marijuana charges against defendants was premature as the trial court failed to conduct the evidentiary hearing that was required under § 21-28.6-8(b) to determine whether the § 21-28.6-8(a) elements had been met.

       Legislative findings.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The general assembly finds and declares that:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t21c28.6s21-28.6-2ol11">
       Modern medical research has discovered beneficial uses for marijuana in treating or alleviating pain, nausea, and other symptoms associated with certain debilitating medical conditions, as found by the National Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Medicine in March 1999.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c28.6s21-28.6-2ol12">
       According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, ninety-nine (99) out of every one hundred (100) marijuana arrests in the United States are made under state law, rather than under federal law. Consequently, changing state law will have the practical effect of protecting from arrest the vast majority of seriously ill people who have a medical need to use marijuana.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c28.6s21-28.6-2ol13">
       Although federal law currently prohibits any use of marijuana, the laws of Alaska, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington permit the medical use and cultivation of marijuana. Rhode Island joins in this effort for the health and welfare of its citizens.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c28.6s21-28.6-2ol14">
       States are not required to enforce federal law or prosecute people for engaging in activities prohibited by federal law. Therefore, compliance with this chapter does not put the state of Rhode Island in violation of federal law.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c28.6s21-28.6-2ol15">
       State law should make a distinction between the medical and nonmedical use of marijuana. Hence, the purpose of this chapter is to protect patients with debilitating medical conditions, and their physicians and primary caregivers, from arrest and prosecution, criminal and other penalties, and property forfeiture if such patients engage in the medical use of marijuana.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c28.6s21-28.6-2ol16">
       The general assembly enacts this chapter pursuant to its police power to enact legislation for the protection of the health of its citizens, as reserved to the state in the Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c28.6s21-28.6-2ol17">
       It is in the state’s interests of public safety, public welfare, and the integrity of the medical marijuana program to ensure that the possession and cultivation of marijuana for the sole purpose of medical use for alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions is adequately regulated.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c28.6s21-28.6-2ol18">
       The goal of the medical marijuana program is to create a system that is transparent, safe, and responsive to the needs of patients. Consequently, the medical marijuana program requires regulation and a comprehensive regulatory structure that allows for oversight over all suppliers of medical marijuana while ensuring both safety and patient access.

     <p>
      “Opioid antagonist” means a drug which is a competitive antagonist that binds to the opioid receptors with higher affinity than agonists but does not activate the receptors, effectively blocking the receptor, preventing the human body from making use of opiates and endorphins.

Whenever a complaint shall be made of any violation of the provisions of this section, the board of pharmacy, on being notified of it, shall investigate the complaint, employing competent persons when necessary to make analysis of the articles alleged to be adulterated; and if the complaint shall be substantiated, the board shall assist in prosecuting the respondent.

     <p>
      It is found that the state of Rhode Island is in need of a regulatory format for the sale of home food service plans to ensure that consumers receive straightforward and informative disclosure as to the identity, quantity, weight and price of their purchase, while also assuring that those within the industry have a clear understanding of what they are required to disclose to a consumer. Disclosure by a simple one page written agreement which shows the price of the food and nonfood items, the price of the service charge and the total price of the plan, along with the document disclosing both a unit price and the item price should provide the consumer with significant and useful information. That information will permit consumers to judge whether or not the price of the food offered for sale is what they want to pay, whether the cost of the services associated with the plan is what they want to pay and whether the total price of the plan is what they want to pay, and thus allow for an informed consumer value decision to be made.

       Caffeine is a known alkaloid found in cocoa, coffee, tea, kola nuts, and is naturally present in more than sixty (60) plants. While generally used as a stimulant, it does not actually provide energy, but on the contrary, provides the illusion of energy. While caffeine can be found naturally, powdered caffeine is manufactured in a laboratory setting, and if used in small doses, can be used safely to caffeinate medicines, food, and soft drinks. When used in high doses however, caffeine can raise the user’s blood pressure, cause heartburn, dehydration, and can lead to seizures, erratic heartbeats, and in some cases, death.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c37s21-37-1ol1b">
       Currently, powdered caffeine is not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, and it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the health and safety of the consumers, particularly minors, by regulating the sale, possession, and use of powdered caffeine within the state of Rhode Island.
