        A cause of action may lie against the director of the Rhode Island department of behavioral healthcare, developmental disabilities and hospitals under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act,

Since any person who falls within the definition of “developmental disability” for the purposes of the DDA,

        The department’s power to establish a maximum-consecutive-work-hours cap for those healthcare employees who work with its custodial patients is not properly arbitrable because arbitration conflicts with the nondelegable managerial duties of the department and its director to provide for the safety and the welfare of the disabled, custodial patients and for the protection of the public health.

         Any physician who, after examining a person, has reason to believe that the person is in need of immediate care and treatment, and is one whose continued unsupervised presence in the community would create an imminent likelihood of serious harm by reason of mental disability, may apply at a facility for the emergency certification of the person thereto. The medical director, or any other physician employed by the proposed facility for certification, may apply under this subsection if no other physician is available and he or she certifies this fact. If an examination is not possible because of the emergency nature of the case and because of the refusal of the person to consent to the examination, the applicant on the basis of his or her observation may determine, in accordance with the above, that emergency certification is necessary and may apply therefor. In the event that no physician is available, a qualified mental health professional who believes the person to be in need of immediate care and treatment, and one whose continued unsupervised presence in the community would create an imminent likelihood of serious harm by reason of mental disability, may make the application for emergency certification to a facility. Application shall in all cases be made to the facility that, in the judgment of the applicant at the time of application, would impose the least restraint on the liberty of the person consistent with affording him or her the care and treatment necessary and appropriate to his or her condition.
        </li>
        <li id="t40.1c05s40.1-5-7ol1a2">
         Whenever an applicant, not employed by a community mental health center established pursuant to chapter 8.5 of this title, has reason to believe that the institute of mental health is the appropriate facility for the person, the application shall be directed to the community mental health center that serves the area in which the person resides, if the person is a Rhode Island resident, or the area in which the person is physically present, if a nonresident, and the qualified mental health professional(s) at the center shall make the final decision on the application to the institute of mental health or may determine whether some other disposition should be made.

       Applications.  An application for certification hereunder shall be in writing and filed with the facility to which admission is sought. The application shall be executed within five (5) days prior to the date of filing and shall state that it is based upon a personal observation of the prospective patient by the applicant within the five-day (5) period. It shall include a description of the applicant’s credentials and the behavior that constitutes the basis for his or her judgment that the prospective patient is in need of immediate care and treatment and that a likelihood of serious harm by reason of mental disability exists, and shall include, as well, any other relevant information that may assist the admitting physician at the facility to which application is made. Whenever practicable, prior to transporting or arranging for the transporting of a prospective patient to a facility, the applicant shall telephone or otherwise communicate with the facility to describe the circumstances and known clinical history to determine whether it is the proper facility to receive the person, and to give notice of any restraint to be used or to determine whether restraint is necessary.

       Confirmation; discharge; transfer.  Within one hour after reception at a facility, the person regarding whom an application has been filed under this section shall be seen by a physician. As soon as possible, but in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after reception, a preliminary examination and evaluation of the person by a psychiatrist or a physician under his or her supervision shall begin. The psychiatrist shall not be an applicant hereunder. The preliminary examination and evaluation shall be completed within seventy-two (72) hours from its inception by the psychiatrist. If the psychiatrist determines that the patient is not a candidate for emergency certification, he or she shall be discharged. If the psychiatrist(s) determines that the person who is the subject of the application is in need of immediate care and treatment and is one whose continued unsupervised presence in the community would create an imminent likelihood of serious harm by reason of mental disability, he or she shall confirm the admission for care and treatment under this section of the person to the facility, provided the facility is one that would impose the least restraint on the liberty of the person consistent with affording him or her the care and treatment necessary and appropriate to his or her condition and that no suitable alternatives to certification are available. If at any time the official in charge of a facility, or his or her designee, determines that the person is not in need of immediate care and treatment, or is not one whose continued unsupervised presence in the community would create an imminent likelihood of serious harm by reason of mental disability, or suitable alternatives to certification are available, he or she shall immediately discharge the person. In addition, the official may arrange to transfer the person to an appropriate facility if the facility to which he or she has been certified is not one that imposes the least restraint on the liberty of the person consistent with affording him or her the care and treatment necessary and appropriate to his or her condition.

The application shall set forth that the person who is to be certified is in need of immediate care and treatment and his or her continued unsupervised presence in the community would create an imminent likelihood of serious harm by reason of mental disability, and the reasons why an order directing a peace officer to transport the person to a designated facility is necessary.

        Mental health center possessed neither the legal authority nor the opportunity to exercise control over an outpatient that gave rise to a duty to control the patient to the extent of initiating involuntary commitment proceedings under R.I. Gen. Laws § 40.1-5-7; there was no evidence illustrating what the patient’s condition was when the district court last ordered him into counseling at the center, or what his condition was when he was last treated there, some four months before he attacked plaintiff. Plaintiff also failed to present any physicians’ affidavits in opposition to the center’s motion for summary judgment; thus, a special relationship did not exist that triggered a corresponding duty to control the patient.

        Community mental health center had no duty to exercise control over the outpatient to prevent him from assaulting plaintiff; the relationship between a mental health provider and its patient, in and of itself, was not sufficient to give rise to a duty to control the patient, and the assault was not a foreseeable consequence of the alleged negligent conduct (failure to exercise control by initiating R.I. Gen. Laws § 40.1-5-7 certification proceedings). Further, the outpatient’s liberty rights as expressed in § 40.1-8.5-1(a) had to be protected by following the statutory commitment procedures, and public policy concerns and notions of fairness militated against imposing a duty under the facts of the case.

        In a wrongful death action, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 10-7-1, involving the suicide death of a patient approximately 36 hours after he was discharged from a hospital emergency room, while the doctor should have sought an emergency mental health hold under R.I. Gen. Laws § 40.1-5-7, the trial justice did not err in granting defendants’ R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law because the decedent’s family failed to present expert testimony with respect to the issue of proximate cause. The record was devoid of any expert opinion that the decedent would not have been discharged within 36 hours after his arrival at a mental health facility. Almonte v. Kurl,

If the court finds that there is no probable cause to support certification, the petition shall be dismissed, and the person shall be discharged unless the person applies for voluntary admission. However, if the court is satisfied by the testimony that there is probable cause to support certification, a final hearing shall be held not less than seven (7) days, nor more than twenty-one (21) days, after the preliminary hearing, unless continued at the request of counsel for the person, and notice of the date set down for the hearing shall be served on the person. Copies of the petition and notice of the date set down for the hearing shall also be served immediately upon the person’s nearest relatives or legal guardian, if known, and to any other person designated by the patient, in writing, to receive copies of notices. The preliminary hearing can be waived by a motion of the patient to the court if the patient is a resident of a facility.

       In general.  Each patient admitted or certified to a facility pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be the subject of a periodic review of his or her condition and status to be conducted by a review committee composed of at least one psychiatrist and other mental health professionals involved in treating the patient. The committee shall be composed of no fewer than three (3) persons and shall be appointed by the director of the facility or his or her designated agent. The reviews shall minimally involve an evaluation of the quality of care the patient is receiving, including an evaluation of the patient’s treatment plan, and the making of any recommendations for the improvement of the care or for the revision of the treatment plan, including alternative available living arrangements, foster care, community residential facilities, nursing homes, and other convalescent facilities. At every fourth review, one member of the committee shall be a member of the hospital’s utilization review committee appointed by that committee’s chairperson.
      </li>
      <li id="t40.1c05s40.1-5-10ol1b">
       Frequency.  The review proceedings shall take place at least once within each ninety-day (90) period during which a person is a patient in the facility.
      </li>
      <li id="t40.1c05s40.1-5-10ol1c">
       Results of review.  The results of each review shall be entered in the patient’s medical record, presented orally to the patient within twenty-four (24) hours, and confirmed by written notice to the patient and his or her guardian, or with the patient’s consent, to his or her next of kin, within seventy-two (72) hours. In the event the director of the facility is not a member of the committee, the notice shall be transmitted to him or her as well. Where the committee determines that further care in the facility is required, the notice to the patient shall include an explanation of the patient’s rights to pursue discharge as elsewhere provided in this chapter.

A hearing must be held pursuant to the petition and a decision rendered before the expiration of the six-month (6) period. A recertification hearing shall follow all of the procedures set forth in § 40.1-5-8 and recertification may be ordered only if the petitioner proves by clear and convincing evidence that the conduct and responses of the patient during the course of the previous six-month (6) period indicate that the patient is presently in need of care and treatment in a facility; is one whose continued unsupervised presence in the community would create a likelihood of serious harm by reason of mental disability; and that all alternatives to recertification have been investigated and deemed unsuitable.

A transfer as above described may be accomplished without the consent of a patient, or his or her guardian, only upon prior application to, and a hearing in, the district court (or family court in the case of a patient under eighteen (18) years of age) and a specific finding by the court that the proposed transfer is in the best interests of the patient and is to a facility that will afford the patient the care and treatment necessary and appropriate to his or her condition.

      For the purposes of this chapter, facilities shall be maintained by the state for the care, treatment, and maintenance of the mentally disabled, and the patients may be maintained and treated in the facilities or in foster family care, and may receive the services conditioned upon prompt and regular payments for the care, maintenance, and treatment or for the services in amounts as fixed by the director. In the discretion of the director, the rates so fixed may be the reimbursement rates or in excess thereof. A preference shall be given to persons whose estate, or the person or persons legally liable for their support, cannot sufficiently pay for the care and treatment, or for the services in licensed private facilities or from sources outside the department. The director, in his or her discretion, may accept payments for services at less than the reimbursement rates, but the acceptance of the lesser payments shall not release the patient, his or her estate, or relatives, if they have sufficient financial ability, from the obligation to make up the difference between the amount fixed, accepted, or paid and the full reimbursement rates.

If the maximum term for the most serious offense charged is life imprisonment or death, the court shall, for the purpose of computation, deem the offense to be punishable by a maximum term of thirty (30) years.

On the basis of the evidence, the court shall make a finding as to the defendant’s competency and, if he or she is found to be incompetent, whether a reasonable likelihood exists that he or she will become competent prior to the dismissal of the charges pursuant to subsection (j).

        R.I. Gen. Laws § 40.1-5.3-3 provides for a series of procedures, evaluations, and hearings designed to ensure that criminal defendants are competent to stand trial. It therefore serves the dual purposes of protecting a criminal defendant’s right to be competent during his or her trial, while also serving the public’s interest in prosecuting crimes.

        Amnesia, without more, does not per se render an accused incompetent to stand trial. Trial courts should consider each amnesia case on its own merits pursuant to the holding in State v. Cook,

In certain instances a defendant’s amnesia could be so severe as to render him or her unable to understand the proceedings and assist his or her counsel at trial and thus render the defendant incompetent within the meaning of this section.

        The defendant was held competent to stand trial where both psychiatric experts agreed that he understood the role of the parties involved in and the nature of the proceedings, where the more credible expert’s report stated that the defendant admitted that he was able to assist counsel by: (1) discussing the possibility of calling specific alibi witnesses; (2) discussing the significance of a valid search warrant; (3) alerting his counsel to the possible bias of two potential jury members; (4) understanding the term “plea bargain” and discussing the possibility of entering a plea; (5) discussing by means of conversations and notes any discrepancies he noted in some of the witnesses’ testimony; (6) understanding that his defense counsel could use the noted discrepancies on cross-examination to “make some of the witnesses look very bad”; (7) understanding that some of the initial counts of the indictment were dismissed prior to trial, and (8) understanding that he was charged with a very serious offense, and where he was astute enough to believe that his initial attorney was not adequately protecting his rights and, thus, retained more experienced counsel.

        Since there was ample evidence to support the court’s finding that involuntarily committed criminal defendant’s competence would be fleeting without the specialized treatment he was receiving at the mental health facility, and that his release or remand to the Adult Correctional Institution would cause him to decompensate to such a degree that he would be unable to retain his competency and proceed to trial, the court did not err in ordering the criminal defendant to continue the commitment notwithstanding his certification of competency.

        Although two periodic reviews after defendant’s appeal of her initial commitment pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 40.1-5.3-4(e) indicated defendant, who was acquitted of murder by reason of insanity, was experiencing a recurrence of psychotic symptoms, defendant’s appeal was not moot because the initial finding of dangerousness and the commitment order were relevant considerations for purposes of the appeal and defendant had a continuing stake in the outcome. State v. Fuller-Balletta,
        <cite class="ocri">
         996 A.2d 133

        Sufficient evidence supported a trial justice’s determination at an initial commitment hearing that defendant, who was acquitted of murder by reason of insanity, was dangerous and ordered defendant to remain in the custody of the department, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 40.1-5.3-4(e), because the testimony of the director and the record demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that defendant’s unsupervised presence in the community would have created a likelihood of serious harm. State v. Fuller-Balletta,

        Trial justice did not err by not considering the motivation underlying defendant’s psychotic delusions, which gave rise to an insanity acquittal, for purposes of determining defendant’s dangerousness pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 40.1-5.3-4 because the events that precipitated defendant’s delusions were not relevant to the question of dangerousness; defendant was acquitted by reason of insanity of murdering her twelve-year-old daughter.

       <p>
        Trial justice did not err by refusing to order the department to place defendant, who was acquitted of murder by reason of insanity, in a community-based outpatient setting at an initial commitment hearing because R.I. Gen. Laws § 40.1-5.3-4(e) did not grant the trial justice the authority to order such a placement; the trial justice’s finding that defendant was dangerous required the commitment of defendant to inpatient care in a public institution.

The fiscal agent shall request that the general treasurer commence and prosecute an action, suit, or proceeding pursuant to § 40.1-5.3-11 whenever he or she determines that an action, suit, or proceeding is appropriate in light of the estate belonging to the prisoner sought to be charged. In determining the appropriateness of an action, suit, or proceeding, the fiscal agent shall consider the effect that execution against the estate would have upon the support and maintenance of those persons, if any, to whom the prisoner sought to be charged is liable for support.

        If a duty were imposed on a mental health center, in the absence of any evidence that an outpatient met the statutory requirements for commitment, then mental health professionals, faced with a choice between initiating certification proceedings and potential liability, would feel pressure to choose the former option. This result would run contrary to the State’s plan for treating patients in a manner that placed the least restraint on their liberty, as required by R.I. Gen. Laws § 40.1-8.5-1(a). Santana v. Rainbow Cleaners, Inc.,

       </p>
       <p>
        Community mental health center had no duty to exercise control over the outpatient to prevent him from assaulting plaintiff; the relationship between a mental health provider and its patient, in and of itself, was not sufficient to give rise to a duty to control the patient, and the assault was not a foreseeable consequence of the alleged negligent conduct (failure to exercise control by initiating R.I. Gen. Laws § 40.1-5-7 certification proceedings). Further, the outpatient’s liberty rights as expressed in § 40.1-8.5-1(a) had to be protected by following the statutory commitment procedures, and public policy concerns and notions of fairness militated against imposing a duty under the facts of the case.

       Article I
      </h3>
      <p>
       The party states find that the proper and expeditious treatment of persons who are mentally ill and developmentally disabled can be facilitated by cooperative action, to the benefit of the patients, their families, and society as a whole. Further the party states find that the necessity of and desirability for furnishing such care and treatment bears no primary relation to the residence or citizenship of the patient but that, on the contrary, the controlling factors of community safety and humanitarianism require that facilities and services be made available for all who are in need of them. Consequently, it is the purpose of this compact and of the party states to provide the necessary legal basis for the institutionalization or other appropriate care and treatment of people who are mentally ill and developmentally disabled under a system that recognizes the paramount importance of patient welfare and to establish the responsibilities of the party states in terms of such welfare.

        Because an individual who was committed by a district court to a residential living facility for adults with developmental disabilities was a person aggrieved by the order of the district court for further residential care, the individual had a right to appeal the findings and order of the district court de novo to the Supreme Court of Rhode Island. Furthermore, the filing of the individual’s notice of appeal 11 days after the order was entered was timely.

     <p>
      In cases other than voluntary admissions, if it is determined that care and treatment for a period in excess of six (6) months is required, and no prior application for a hearing was made by the client or someone in his or her behalf, then to retain a client beyond the period, the official in charge of the facility to which the client was admitted shall notify the client, his or her spouse and nearest relative, if known, and the applicant petitioning for his or her original admission, if available, of the client’s right to a hearing on the issue of his or her continued retention. If no request for a hearing is made within ten (10) days of notification, the client may be retained for an additional six-month (6) period, subject thereafter to similar notifications, at least, annually.
