      <li id="t19c02s19-2-14ol1a">
       Any mutual savings bank chartered under the laws of this state may convert to and become a financial institution with capital stock upon adoption of a plan of conversion by two-thirds (2/3) vote of the board of trustees and approval of the plan by the director, or the director’s designee, and a majority vote of the depositors of the savings bank present in person or by proxy at a meeting called by the board of trustees. For the purpose of this section, unless otherwise required under applicable provisions of federal banking law, the depositor shall be deemed to be the individual whose tax identification number or social security number is used by the bank for interest reporting purposes to the Internal Revenue Service. The plan of conversion shall provide that the savings bank shall issue and sell the stock issued in connection with the conversion at a price that represents its pro forma market value, as determined by an independent appraisal, and shall offer its stock initially in a subscription offering to the depositors of the savings bank on an eligibility record date established by the board of trustees, giving those depositors priority rights to purchase the shares over the general public pro rata based on deposits. The converted savings bank shall also create a liquidation account for the benefit of its depositors on the eligibility record date, in an amount representing the undivided profits and guaranty fund of the savings bank at that time, balances of which shall be calculated and subsequently recalculated as determined in accordance with regulations promulgated by the director, or the director’s designee. Unless otherwise impaired, any liquidation account so created also shall be considered as part of the paid-in and unimpaired capital stock and surplus of any stock financial institution. The plan of conversion may provide for restrictions on the amount of stock that any person or entity may purchase in the conversion, or own or control thereafter, which may also be incorporated into the stock agreement to form the converted entity.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c02s19-2-14ol1b">
       In connection with the conversion, the financial institution may form a holding company or utilize an existing holding company to hold all the shares of the financial institution, and offer to its depositors and general public (subject to subscription rights in favor of depositors) all of the stock of the holding company in lieu of the capital stock of the financial institution. This conversion may also be accomplished pursuant to a merger as permitted by this title. The converting savings bank may, at the time of conversion, merge any financial institution subsidiary into the capital stock financial institution resulting from the conversion, or cause the subsidiary to become a separate subsidiary of a holding company.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c02s19-2-14ol1c">
       No savings bank may convert to a stock form of financial institution unless its deposits will continue to be federally insured. The corporate existence of a mutual savings bank converting to the stock financial institution shall not terminate, but the financial institution shall be deemed to be a continuation of entity of the savings bank so converted.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c02s19-2-14ol1d">
       In connection with its approval of the plan of conversion, the director, or the director’s designee, shall approve the proposed stock agreement to form the converted entity. The director, or the director’s designee, upon finding that the requirements of this section and applicable regulations have been met, and that the conversion has been completed with the sale of all shares offered in the conversion, shall issue a certificate of approval of the conversion to the converted entity. Upon the payment of fifty dollars ($50.00), the certificate of approval shall be filed in the office of the secretary of state, together with the certificate of the general treasurer that the converted entity has paid into the treasury for the use of the state a sum equal to one tenth of one percent (.1%) of its capital stock which, in no event, shall be less than one hundred dollars ($100). Upon the filing of the certificate with the secretary of state and payment of fifty dollars ($50.00), the secretary of state shall immediately record the certificate of approval and stock agreement to form, whereupon the stock agreement to form will become effective.

The method of organizing the mutual holding company shall be set forth in a plan of mutual holding company reorganization. The corporate existence of a mutual savings bank converting to a stock financial institution as part of the reorganizing into the mutual holding company structure shall not terminate, but the stock financial institution, referred to in this section as the continuing stock financial institution, shall be deemed to be a continuation of the reorganizing mutual savings bank. The mutual holding company must at all times own, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediate stock holding companies, a majority of the voting shares of capital stock of the continuing stock financial institution. A mutual holding company organized under this section also may include an intermediate stock holding company so long as the mutual holding company owns a majority of the voting shares of capital stock of the intermediate stock holding company.

The approval of the plan of mutual holding company reorganization by a majority vote of the depositors of the mutual savings bank present in person or by proxy at a meeting called by the board of trustees is also required.

Any merger or consolidation may occur concurrently with a mutual holding company reorganization under this section, or subsequent to the initial reorganization, and cash and/or stock may be used as consideration for the merger or consolidation as long as the mutual holding company directly or indirectly owns a majority of the voting shares of capital stock of the intermediate stock holding company or stock financial institution after the merger or consolidation.

       The director, or the director’s designee, shall, whenever he or she considers it advisable, but at least once in each year, examine each regulated institution. However, the director may extend the examination period for eligible financial institutions to at least once every eighteen (18) months. For the purposes of this section, an eligible financial institution means a financial institution with total assets of less than two hundred fifty million dollars ($250,000,000) that has not experienced a change in control in the last twelve-month (12) period and that is:
       <ol>

          In addition, the director may also consider other factors that may be considered by federal banking regulatory agencies when those agencies determine whether financial institutions qualify for an extended examination cycle. At each examination the director, or the director’s designee, shall have free access to all books, records, papers, assets and any other information deemed necessary by the director, or the director’s designee, to ascertain the regulated institution’s condition; its ability to fulfill its obligations; and whether it has complied with the provisions of law.

     <p>
      The credit committee or duly appointed loan officer shall approve, in writing, every loan or advance made by the credit union, subject to any limitations that may be set from time to time by the board of directors. Every application for a loan shall be made in writing and shall state the purpose for which the loan is desired and the security offered. No loan shall be made unless the credit committee or loan officer is satisfied that it promises to benefit the borrower, nor unless it has been approved by the committee or duly appointed loan officer in accordance with applicable credit union bylaw provisions. The applicant for a loan may appeal the decision of the credit committee or loan officer to the board of directors. If written approval of the credit committee or loan officer is obtained, nothing contained in this section shall prevent a credit union from extending credit to a member in any manner in which it sees fit; provided that no extension of credit shall be made upon an unsecured revolving credit plan, line of credit, or letter of credit in which the credit authorization exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000), unless the credit authorization is reviewed at least annually by the credit committee, if one exists, or by the board of directors.

       If authorized by the credit union board of directors, a credit union registered to do business in the State of Rhode Island may conduct a savings promotion raffle, provided that it has given the department of business regulation prior written notice of its intent to conduct such a raffle. Said notice shall include an attestation that the raffle meets all requirements of all applicable laws and regulations including, but not limited to, the national credit union administration (NCUA) regulations and guidelines related to such contests; that the raffle will be administered in a manner that is fair and non-discriminatory to credit union members; and that there will be no adverse impact on the financial condition of the credit union as a result of the proposed savings promotion raffle. The credit union shall conduct a savings promotion raffle so that each token or ticket representing an entry in the raffle has an equal chance of being drawn. A credit union shall not conduct a savings promotion raffle in a manner that jeopardizes the credit union’s safety and financial soundness or misleads its members.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c05s19-5-29ol1b">
       Pursuant to his or her supervisory powers the director of the department of business regulation may examine the conduct of a savings promotion raffle at any time. The director may issue a cease and desist order for a violation of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c05s19-5-29ol1c">
       A credit union shall maintain records sufficient to facilitate an audit of a savings promotion raffle.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c05s19-5-29ol1d">
       As used in this section, “savings promotion raffle” means a raffle conducted by a credit union where the sole consideration required for a chance of winning designated prizes is the deposit of at least a specified amount of money in a savings account or other savings program offered by the credit union.

       Any credit union chartered under the laws of this state may convert to and become a financial institution chartered under the laws of this state or another financial services entity chartered under the laws of the United States. The conversion shall not require the prior liquidation of the subject credit union. In the event that any credit union chartered under the laws of this state elects to convert to and become a financial institution chartered under the laws of this state, the credit union shall first demonstrate compliance with the various requirements of Chapter 2 of this title, as appropriate. In the alternative, in the event that any credit union chartered under the laws of this state elects to convert to and become another form of financial services entity chartered under the laws of the United States, the credit union shall first demonstrate compliance with the various requirements of the federal laws and regulations governing the chartering of that designated financial services entity.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c5.1s19-5.1-3ol1b">
       Any credit union chartered under the laws of this state may convert to and become a financial institution chartered under the laws of this state or another form of financial services entity chartered under the laws of the United States upon adoption of a plan of conversion by two-thirds (2/3) vote of the board of directors and approval of the plan by the director, or the director’s designee, and a majority vote of those members of the credit union qualified to vote pursuant to § 19-5-7 who are present in person or by proxy at a meeting called by the board of directors. For the purpose of this section, unless otherwise required under applicable provisions of federal or state banking law, a member shall be deemed to be the individual whose tax identification number or social security number is used by the credit union for interest reporting purposes to the Internal Revenue Service.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c5.1s19-5.1-3ol1c">
       In the event that the plan of conversion calls for the issuance of capital stock, it shall also provide that the converted entity shall issue and sell the stock issued in connection with the conversion at a price that represents its pro forma market value, as determined by an independent appraisal, and shall offer its stock initially in a subscription offering to the members of the credit union on an eligibility record date established by the board of directors, giving those members priority rights to purchase the shares over the general public pro rata based on deposits. The converted credit union shall also create a liquidation account for the benefit of its members on the eligibility record date, in an amount representing the total equity of the credit union at the time, the balances of which shall be calculated and subsequently recalculated as determined in accordance with regulations promulgated by the director, or the director’s designee. Unless otherwise impaired, any liquidation account so created also shall be considered as part of the paid-in and unimpaired capital stock and surplus of the newly chartered stock financial institution or financial services entity. The plan of conversion may provide for restrictions on the amount of stock that any person or entity may purchase in the conversion, or own or control thereafter, which may also be incorporated into the stock agreement to form the converted entity.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c5.1s19-5.1-3ol1d">
       In connection with the conversion, the financial institution or other financial services entity may form a holding company or utilize an existing holding company to hold all the shares of the financial institution or other financial services entity, and offer to its depositors and general public (subject to subscription rights in favor of depositors) all of the stock of the holding company in lieu of the capital stock of the financial institution or other financial services entity. This conversion may also be accomplished pursuant to a merger.

       No credit union may convert to a financial institution or other financial services entity unless its deposits will continue to be federally insured. The corporate existence of a credit union converting to the financial institution or other financial services entity shall not terminate, but the financial institution or other financial services entity shall be deemed to be a continuation of the corporate entity credit union so converted.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c5.1s19-5.1-3ol1f">
       In connection with its approval of any plan of conversion to a financial institution chartered under the laws of this state, the director, or the director’s designee, shall approve the proposed agreement to form and the proposed bylaws of the converted entity. The director, or the director’s designee, upon finding that the requirements of this section and applicable regulations have been met (including, when applicable, that the conversion to any entity issuing stock has been completed with the sale of all shares offered in the conversion to a stock form of financial institution), shall issue a certificate of approval of the conversion to the converted entity. Upon the payment of fifty dollars ($50.00), the certificate of approval shall be filed with the secretary of state, together with the certificate of the general treasurer that the converted entity has paid into the treasury for the use of the state a sum equal to one tenth of one percent (.10%) of its capital stock which in no event shall be less than one hundred dollars ($100). Upon the filing of the certificate with the secretary of state and payment of fifty dollars ($50.00), the secretary of state shall immediately record the certificate of approval and any agreement to form, at which time the agreement to form will become effective.

     <p>
      Whenever the director, or the director’s designee, considers it advisable, he or she may make, or cause to be made, an examination of each Rhode Island bank-holding company. The director, or the director’s designee(s), may also examine any deposit-taking subsidiary of the bank-holding company that fails to meet its minimum capital requirements under applicable federal law, or has received from its principal bank regulator, as its last composite rating based on capital, asset quality, management, earnings, and liquidity (CAMEL) or similar regulatory rating, a three, four, five, or other unsatisfactory rating. The director, or the director’s designee, shall have the same examination power and authority as he or she has for the examination of regulated institutions. The total cost of these examinations shall be paid in the same manner as other regulated institutions pursuant to this title. In lieu of this examination, the director, or the director’s designee, shall accept the report of an examination made within the last fifteen (15) months by any federal bank regulatory agency or the equivalent supervisory official of another state, pursuant to the laws of that state.

       Every lending institution that accepts an application for any residential mortgage loan or any commercial mortgage loan and requires that a title attorney search the title of the subject real estate, or requires a policy of title insurance, shall permit the prospective mortgagor to select a qualified title attorney or title insurance company of his, her, or its own choice to search the title of the subject real estate and to furnish title insurance. The lending institution shall not unreasonably disapprove a title insurance policy provided or paid for directly or indirectly by a borrower. The disapproval shall be deemed unreasonable if it is not based solely on reasonable standards uniformly applied, relating only to the extent of coverage required or the financial soundness of an insurer. The standards shall not discriminate against any particular insurer, nor shall the standards call for the disapproval of an insurance policy because the policy contained coverage in addition to that required. Acceptance of a title insurance company’s policy by the Federal National Mortgage Association or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation shall be conclusive proof that the title insurance company meets the reasonable standards required by this section whether or not the borrower is applying for a residential or a commercial mortgage loan.

       In the event the prospective mortgagor does not select a qualified title attorney or title insurance company, the prospective mortgagor shall sign a waiver permitting the lending institution to select an attorney. If any lending institution violates this section, an aggrieved party may file a complaint in the superior court of the county in which the aggrieved party shall dwell or has his, her, or its principal place of business, or Providence county, if the superior court of that county shall not be in session, or if the aggrieved party is a nonresident or has no principal place of business in this state, of any other county as may be agreed upon by the parties to the petition, and serve upon the lending institution a petition for an order of the court for the enforcement of this section, and the petition may request and the court shall have jurisdiction to grant, after notice and hearing, an order:

     <p>
      Any financial institution with capital stock chartered under the laws of this state and that is solvent may, upon notice to the director, or the director’s designee, pursuant to § 19-10.1-2 and subject to the approval of the director, or the director’s designee, convert to and become a general business corporation organized under the Rhode Island Business Corporation Act, chapter 1.2 of title 7, or another financial services entity chartered under the laws of the United States. As a condition of such conversion, such financial institution shall amend its agreement to form a financial institution, and where applicable for financial institutions organized before December 31, 1995, the articles of incorporation or the agreement of association of the financial institution, such amendment to be by a vote of its stockholders owning two-thirds (2/3) of its capital stock. For the purpose of closing out any depository or other exclusively financial institution related business activities authorized pursuant to § 19-3-1, the directors or trustees of the financial institution shall submit to the director, or the director’s designee, for approval either: (a) A plan, satisfactory in form and content to the director, or the director’s designee, for termination of any remaining depository or other transactions entered into under or pursuant to the powers, rights or activities reserved to financial institutions under § 19-3-1 and to which such entity remains to be a party; or (b) A certification, satisfactory in form and content to the director, or the director’s designee, to the effect that all such depository and other banking related transactions have been terminated for at least one (1) year. The director, or the director’s designee, shall, upon timely completion of its review and approval of the plan or certification, issue an approval and consent for the conversion. The conversion shall not require the prior liquidation of the subject entity. The corporate existence of such entity shall not terminate and such entity shall be deemed to be a continuation of the previously existing financial institution, absent any powers of deposit taking or other powers exclusively reserved to financial institutions under § 19-3-1. Upon issuance of the approval by the director, or the director’s designee, for such conversion, the secretary of state shall be so notified and the agreement to form, or for financial institutions organized before December 31, 1995, the articles of incorporation or the agreement of association, of the financial institution shall be amended by filing an amendment with the secretary of state so as to change the name of the entity to one containing words other than those identified with a financial institution and to otherwise conform its articles of incorporation or agreement of association with the requirements of a business corporation organized under the Rhode Island Business Corporation Act, chapter 1.2 of title 7.

      The director, or the director’s designee, is empowered immediately to take possession of any financial institution or credit union and its assets if, upon examination, any financial institution or credit union, which has or has not invoked the conservatorship provisions or the voluntary liquidation provisions of this title, appears to be insolvent by reason of:

      It is hereby found as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t19c12s19-12-6ol11">
       Certain financial institutions or credit unions, whose deposits were previously insured by the Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corporation, are presently unable to obtain adequate deposit insurance as required by § 19-4-10 (formerly § 19-11-9).
      </li>
      <li id="t19c12s19-12-6ol12">
       As a result thereof, a proclamation of the governor dated January 1, 1991, declared a banking emergency under chapter 13 (formerly chapter 18) of this title with respect to certain of those financial institutions or credit unions pursuant to which operations of those financial institutions or credit unions have been suspended pending their obtaining adequate deposit insurance, and a number of them have obtained federal deposit insurance and have been permitted to resume operations.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c12s19-12-6ol13">
       There remain more than twelve (12) financial institutions or credit unions subject to orders suspending their operations, which orders preclude approximately one hundred ninety thousand (190,000) members and/or depositors of these financial institutions or credit unions from having access to approximately three hundred thousand (300,000) separate accounts that in the aggregate total more than one billion dollars ($1,000,000,000).
      </li>
      <li id="t19c12s19-12-6ol14">
       The inability of depositors in the remaining financial institutions or credit unions to withdraw their deposits has created hardships not only for those depositors and their families, but also for a broad sector of citizens and businesses in the state of Rhode Island that depend on payments from depositors for goods and services supplied to them.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c12s19-12-6ol15">
       It is hereby determined to be necessary in order to preserve and restore liquidity to the economy of the state, to protect deposits of state funds in these financial institutions or credit unions, and to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the people of the state of Rhode Island, for the general assembly to exercise its constitutional and other powers to enact measures to achieve these essential public purposes by providing for the relief of persons affected by the suspension of withdrawals from the financial institutions or credit unions affected by the banking emergency by expediting access by depositors to funds and assets in these financial institutions or credit unions.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c12s19-12-6ol16">
       The numbers of people, accounts, and funds adversely affected indicate that, without prompt state legislative action, there will be a serious negative impact on the health, safety, and general welfare of the people and the economy of the state, already weakened by current economic conditions.
       <p id="t19c12s19-12-6ol16.1">
        This chapter shall, therefore, be deemed to be an exercise of the police powers of this state to achieve the essential public purpose of providing for the protection of the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the state by amending the general laws of Rhode Island to grant priorities in distributions to depositors upon the liquidation of financial institutions or credit unions and to expedite receivership and other proceedings intended to make available to depositors and other affected parties funds and the value of assets in the affected financial institutions and credit unions.

     <p>
      During the period of a banking emergency, the director may, if deemed necessary for the protection of the public and of the interests of depositors and other creditors of any or all regulated institutions, order the regulated institutions to suspend or restrict, in whole or in part, the payment in currency, or by other means, of the liabilities of the regulated institutions to shareholders, depositors, and other creditors, except as hereinafter provided. The order shall become effective upon receipt by the regulated institutions of notice thereof, and shall continue in full force and effect during the period of banking emergency, until revoked or modified by the director. Whenever, in the judgment of the director, the condition of emergency, because of which the order was made, warrants action, the liability, the payment of which has been suspended or restricted, may be paid by the regulated institution, in whole or pro rata or in part, upon any terms and conditions and in any form as the director shall prescribe, provided that acceptance of any such payment, if and so far as not offered in legal tender, shall be optional with the person entitled to payment of that liability.

      Cash deposits, called “new cash deposits”, received by any regulated institution after an order of the director issued under the provisions of this chapter suspending or restricting withdrawals of currency from that regulated institution, and while the order remains in force either in whole or in part, shall not be subject, by reason of the order, to any limitation or restriction as to payment or withdrawal in currency or otherwise, and shall be segregated and held or invested and used solely to meet the new cash deposit liability; provided, however, that the aggregate amount of cash representing those deposits shall be kept separately in cash, or on deposit in Federal Reserve banks, or invested in obligations of the United States, or as may otherwise be authorized from time to time by order of the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States or other constituted federal authority.

       The application for a license shall be in the form prescribed by the director and shall contain the name and address or addresses where the business of the applicant is located and if the applicant is a partnership, association, corporation, or other form of business organization, the names and addresses of each member, director, and principal officer thereof or any individual acting in the capacity of the manager of an office location. Such application shall also include a description of the activities of the applicant, in such detail and for such periods as the director may require, as well as such further information as the director may require. The director may require a background investigation of each applicant for a license by means of fingerprint checks pursuant to §§ 19-14-7 and 42-14-14, utilizing the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or other agency as determined by the director for state and national criminal history record checks. If the applicant is a partnership, association, corporation, or other form of business organization, the director may require a background investigation by means of fingerprint checks on each member, director, trustee, or principal officer of such applicant and any individual acting in the capacity of the manager of an office location. The director will determine by rule those items of information appearing on a criminal records check that will constitute disqualifying information and therefore render the applicant ineligible for licensing under this chapter in accordance with the provisions of § 19-14-7. Receipt of criminal history record information by a private entity is prohibited. Each application for a license shall be accompanied by an investigation fee. The applicant at the time of making application shall pay to the director, or the director’s designee, the sum of one half (1/2) of the annual license fee as a fee for investigating the application. If the application for license is approved, the applicant shall pay a fee equal to the annual license fee as provided in this chapter. The license shall be continuous and the license fee shall cover the period through December 31 of each year. The annual license fee for any application approved after November 1 of any given year shall satisfy the annual license fee requirement through the end of the next succeeding calendar year ending December 31. The director, or the director’s designee, is authorized to participate in a multi-state licensing system for licensees. The director may establish requirements for participation by an applicant for a license or a person licensed under this chapter. Any such requirements that may be established by the director shall be published on the website of the department of business regulation. Upon implementation, participation by an applicant for a license or by a person licensed under the provisions of this chapter shall be mandatory. The applicant may be required to an additional fee for a license or other participation in such multi-state licensing system.

         The appointment shall be filed with the director, or the director’s designee, in whatever format he or she directs. The power of attorney shall provide all contact information, including the business address, street and number, if any, of the resident attorney. Thereafter, if the resident attorney changes his or her business address or other contact information, he or she shall, within ten (10) days after any change, file in the office of the director, or the director’s designee, notice of the change setting forth the attorney’s current business address or other contact information.

This manner of service upon the licensee shall be sufficient, provided that notice of service and a copy of the process shall be immediately sent by certified mail by the plaintiff, or the plaintiff’s attorney of record, to the licensee at the latest address filed with the director, or the director’s designee. If the licensee has not filed his or her address pursuant to this chapter, notice of service shall be given in any manner that the court in which the action is pending may order as affording the licensee reasonable opportunity to defend the action or to learn of the garnishment.

       For the purpose of discovering violations of this title or securing information lawfully required, the director, or the director’s designee(s), may at any time investigate the loans and business and examine the books, accounts, records, and files used therein, of every licensee and person who shall be engaged in any activity that requires a license under this title, whether the person shall act, or claim to act, as principal or agent, or under or without the authority of this title. For that purpose, the director, or the director’s designee(s), shall have free access to the offices and places of business, books, accounts, paper, records, files, and safes, of all such persons. The director, or the director’s designee(s), shall have authority to require the attendance of, and to examine under oath, any person whose testimony may be required relative to the loans or the business or to the subject matter of any examination, investigation, or hearing.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c14s19-14-23ol1b">
       The director, or the director’s designee, shall make an examination of the affairs, business, office, and records of each licensee and branch location as often as is necessary, based upon all relevant factors, including the volume of activity within the state. The department shall provide a report to the legislature after July 1, 2017, but no later than December 31, 2017, regarding the timing of examinations conducted pursuant to this section and shall make recommendations regarding the sufficiency of conducting examinations based on these factors versus on a stated, periodic basis. The director, or the director’s designee, may accept, in lieu of an examination of the business of a licensed mortgage loan originator, the examination by the director, or the director’s designee, of the licensed lender(s) or licensed loan broker who employ the licensed mortgage loan originator and/or who employed the licensed mortgage loan originator during the period under examination. The total cost of an examination made pursuant to this section shall be paid by the licensee or person being examined and shall include the following expenses:

        <li id="t19c14s19-14-23ol1b1">
         One hundred fifty percent (150%) of the total salaries and benefits plus one hundred percent (100%) for the travel and transportation expenses for the examining personnel engaged in the examinations. The cost of an examination of a mortgage loan originator licensee shall be limited to twenty-five percent (25%) of the total salary and benefits for the personnel engaged in an examination specific to a mortgage loan originator. The fees shall be paid to the director to, and for the use of, the state. The examination fees shall be in addition to any taxes and fees otherwise payable to the state;
        </li>
        <li id="t19c14s19-14-23ol1b2">

All revenues collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited as general revenues. That assessment shall be in addition to any taxes and fees otherwise payable to the state.

      </li>
      <li id="t19c14s19-14-23ol1e">
       If the director, or the director’s designee, has reason to believe that any person required to be licensed under this chapter is conducting a business without having first obtained a license under this chapter, or who, after the denial, suspension, or revocation of a license is conducting that business, the director, or the director’s designee, may issue an order to that person commanding him or her to cease and desist from conducting that business. The order shall provide an opportunity to request a hearing to be held not sooner than three (3) days after issuance of that order to show cause why the order should not become final. Any order issued pursuant to this section shall become final if no request for a hearing is received by the director, or the director’s designee, within thirty (30) days of the issuance of the order. The order may be served on any person by mailing a copy of the order, certified mail, return receipt requested, and first-class mail to that person at any address at which that person has done business or at which that person lives. Any hearing held pursuant to this section shall be governed in accordance with chapter 35 of title 42. If that person fails to comply with an order of the director, or the director’s designee, after being afforded an opportunity for a hearing, the superior court for Providence County has jurisdiction upon complaint of the department to restrain and enjoin that person from violating this chapter.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c14s19-14-23ol1f">
       The director may impose an administrative assessment, as well as the penalties provided for under § 19-14-26, against any person named in an order issued under subsection (e) or, in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to § 19-14-30, against any person who violates, or participates in the violation of, any of the applicable provisions of this title, or any regulation promulgated pursuant to any provisions of this title. The amount of the administrative assessment may not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each violation of this chapter or each act or omission that constitutes a basis for issuing the order. Any person aggrieved by an administrative assessment shall have the opportunity to request a hearing to be held in accordance with chapter 35 of title 42 within thirty (30) days of the imposition of such administrative assessment.

      </p>
      <p>
       “(1) Chapter 14.4 of title 19 entitled ‘Check Cashing’ addresses the licensing of check
       cashing businesses in Rhode Island. Section 19-14.4-3(a) requires the department of business regulation to ‘promulgate regulations that provide for the safety and security of customers of the [check cashing] licensee, and/or its employees . . .,’ and provides that the regulations shall
       include a requirement that check cashing licensees maintain bulletproof glass and steel partitions.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2) Check cashing regulations in Title 230 (‘Department Of Business Regulation’) Chapter 40 (‘Banking’), Subchapter 20 (‘Money Services’) provide, in Part 2 (‘Check
       Cashers’), that licensed check cashers ‘[i]nstall bullet proof glass and partitions . . . at all check
       cashing stations, transaction windows, counters and similar areas where the exchange of funds, checks, money orders and other transactions take place. . .’ 230-RICR-40-20-2.6(A)(3)
      </p>
      <p>
       “(3) Persons hosting state-operated video lottery games and state-operated casino gaming which may include table games and sports betting, may cash checks for their customers as a service incidental to their primary business of hosting state-operated games and gaming. Hosts of
       state-operated video lottery games and state-operated casino gaming do not qualify for the licensing exemptions described in § 19-14.4-1(3) because their charge per check cashed usually exceeds the fifty cent ($0.50) threshold set forth in that section.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(4) Persons hosting state-operated video lottery games and state-operated casino gaming
       are subject to stringent security and procedural requirements related to their primary business of
       hosting such state-operated games and gaming. These security and procedural requirements
       include, but are not limited to, measures to protect the physical safety and security of customers and employees, cybersecurity measures, measures to prevent money laundering, and requirements related to the maintenance of insurance. While in some cases the measures to protect the physical safety and security of check casher customers and employees are different in form and nature than the bulletproof glass and steel partitions contemplated in § 19-14.4-3(a), and subsection 230-RICR-40-20-2.6(A)(3) of the regulations promulgated by the department of business regulation,
       they provide at least the same level of physical safety and security. Accordingly, it is appropriate that persons hosting state-operated video lottery games and state-operated casino gaming be
       exempt from the bulletproof glass and steel partition requirements of § 19-14.4-3(a), and subsection 230-RICR-40-20-2.6(A)(3) of the regulations promulgated by the department of business regulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(5) The purpose of this act is to amend chapter 14.4 of title 19 so as to exempt persons
       hosting state-operated video lottery games and state-operated casino gaming pursuant to licenses issued by the department of business regulation, division of gaming and athletics, and the department of revenue, division of lotteries, from any requirement that they construct and
       maintain bulletproof glass and steel partitions as contemplated in subsection 19-14.4-3(a), and subsection 230-RICR-40-20-2.6(A)(3) of the regulations promulgated by the department of
       business regulation.”

Orthosis does not include prefabricated or direct-formed orthotic devices, as defined in this section, or any of the following assistive technology devices: commercially available knee orthoses used following injury or surgery; spastic muscle-tone inhibiting orthoses; upper extremity adaptive equipment; finger splints; hand splints; wrist gauntlets; face masks used following burns; wheelchair seating that is an integral part of the wheelchair and not worn by the patient independent of the wheelchair; fabric or elastic supports; corsets; low-temperature formed plastic splints; trusses; elastic hose; canes; crutches; cervical collars; dental appliances; and other similar devices as determined by the director of the department of health, such as those commonly carried in stock by a pharmacy, department store, corset shop, or surgical supply facility.

The practice of orthotics encompasses evaluation, treatment, and consultation; with basic observational gait and postural analysis, orthotists assess and design orthoses to maximize function and provide not only the support but the alignment necessary to either prevent or correct a deformity or to improve the safety and efficiency of mobility or locomotion or both. Orthotic practice includes providing continuing patient care in order to assess its effect on the patient’s tissues and to assure proper fit and function of the orthotic device by periodic evaluation.

The practice of prosthetics also includes the generation of an image, form, or mold that replicates the patient’s body or body segment and that requires rectification of dimensions, contours, and volumes for use in the design and fabrication of a socket to accept a residual anatomic limb to, in turn, create an artificial appendage that is designed either to support body weight or to improve or restore function or cosmesis, or both. Involved in the practice of prosthetics is observational gait analysis and clinical assessment of the requirements necessary to refine and mechanically fix the relative position of various parts of the prosthesis to maximize function, stability, and safety of the patient. The practice of prosthetics includes providing and continuing patient care in order to assess the prosthetic device’s effect on the patient’s tissues and to assure proper fit and function of the prosthetic device by periodic evaluation.

       Purpose.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The activities of mortgage loan originators and the origination or offering of financing for residential real property have a direct, valuable, and immediate impact upon Rhode Island’s consumers, Rhode Island’s economy, the neighborhoods and communities of Rhode Island, and the housing and real estate industry. The general assembly finds that accessibility to mortgage credit is vital to the state’s citizens. The general assembly also finds that it is essential for the protection of the citizens of Rhode Island and the stability of Rhode Island’s economy that reasonable standards for licensing and regulation of the business practices of mortgage loan originators be imposed. The general assembly further finds that the obligations of mortgage loan originators to consumers in connection with originating or making residential mortgage loans are such as to warrant the regulation of the mortgage lending process. The purpose of this chapter is to protect consumers seeking mortgage loans and to ensure that the mortgage lending industry is operating without unfair, deceptive, and fraudulent practices on the part of mortgage loan originators. Therefore the general assembly establishes within this chapter:
     </p>

     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislature finds that franchisees may suffer substantial losses when the franchisor does not provide complete information regarding the franchisor and the franchise relationship. The legislature also finds that many franchisees lack bargaining power and purchase a franchise when they are unfamiliar with operating a business, the franchised business and with industry practices in franchising. The act seeks to ensure that each offeree receives the information necessary to make an informed decision about the offered franchise. Further, it is the intent of this chapter to prohibit the sale of franchises when there is a likelihood that the franchisor’s promises will not be fulfilled.

       Where a borrower has multiple loans at the same level of delinquency, a student loan servicer shall apply partial payments in a manner that minimizes late fees and negative credit reporting by applying such payments to satisfy as many individual loan payments as possible on a borrower’s account. For purposes of this section, “partial payment” means a payment on a student loan account that contains multiple individual loans in an amount less than the amount necessary to satisfy the outstanding payment due on all loans in the student loan account, also commonly referred to as an underpayment.

         The parties shall notify all student loan borrowers impacted by the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the servicing of a student education loan at least seven (7) days before the next payment on the loan is due. Notice must include: The identity of the new loan holder and/or servicer; the effective date of the transfer; the date on which the old servicer will no longer accept payments; the date on which the new servicer will begin to accept payments; and contact and billing information for loan payments.
