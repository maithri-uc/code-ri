        Superior court erred in dismissing the charges against defendant for driving under the influence of liquor resulting in serious bodily injury, driving so as to endanger resulting in serious bodily injury, and driving with a revoked license because an operator may be distinct and separate from a driver in certain circumstances, and by forcibly seizing control of a moving vehicle when he jumped up from the backseat and grabbed the steering wheel—thus divesting the driver of control—and steering the vehicle off the highway, causing a roll-over crash, defendant placed himself squarely in the realm of an operator of a vehicle.

        In a prosecution for driving a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner under § 31-9-1, the defendant was not the “owner” of the vehicle under subsection (b) (now (e)) of this section although he paid a $250 deposit, which took the car off the market but which did not operate to transfer ownership, and since no conditional sales contract existed transferring possession of the vehicle.

        In a prosecution for driving with a suspended license, a driver’s abstract from the Registry of Motor Vehicles was clearly admissible under Rules 901(b)(7) and 902(4) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, and was not excluded under Rule 803(8)(B) because it did not contain information observed by police officers or law-enforcement personnel. Also, the admission of this abstract did not violate the defendant’s right to confrontation under the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions by allowing, in effect, New York officials to testify about violations in that state. The report did not contain any statements by New York officials, only a notation of the New York violation. State v. D'Alo,

     </p>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t31c2.1s31-2.1-1ol1a">
       In the presence of a duly authorized police officer in any municipality participating in the program, the registered owner of a motor vehicle shall sign an informed consent statement indicating that the motor vehicle registered to the owner is not normally operated between the hours of 1:00 A.M. and 5:00 A.M. The form of an informed consent statement shall be promulgated by the administrator of the division of motor vehicles.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c2.1s31-2.1-1ol1b">
       <ol type="i">
        <li id="t31c2.1s31-2.1-1ol1b-i">
         Upon signing an informed consent statement, the registered owner shall be issued a decal approved by the administrator of the division of motor vehicles and the decal shall be affixed to the owner’s vehicle in a conspicuous place as prescribed by the administrator. The decal shall be issued and affixed by the police officer in the municipality participating in the program.
        </li>
        <li id="t31c2.1s31-2.1-1ol1b-ii">
         The police officer issuing the decal shall make a record of the decal number issued to each registered owner. These records shall be maintained by the police department of any city or town participating in the program and shall be available to the administrator of the division of motor vehicles, to the superintendent of state police, and to local law enforcement agencies.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t31c2.1s31-2.1-1ol1c">
       Informed consent statement forms shall be available at all division of motor vehicles offices, state police headquarters, and city and town police departments.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c2.1s31-2.1-1ol1d">
       Whenever any police officer sees a motor vehicle displaying a decal issued pursuant to the provisions of this section operated on any public highway in the state between the hours of 1:00 A.M. and 5:00 A.M., the officer is authorized to request the driver to produce a valid driver’s license and motor vehicle registration. Whenever the operator of the motor vehicle during such hours is unable to produce a driver’s license and registration, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the person operating the vehicle is not the registered owner and does not have the authorization of the owner to operate the vehicle.

        The motor vehicle and trailer excise tax is incidental to the ownership of the motor vehicle, as demonstrated by the fact that it is based on the value of the vehicle, and not on the extent or manner in which the vehicle is used, and registration is not revoked immediately upon nonpayment of the tax, since the tax is not specifically for the privilege of registering the vehicle.

     <ol>
      <li id="t31c03s31-3-5ol11">
       That the application contains any false or fraudulent statement, or that the applicant has failed to furnish required information, or reasonable additional information requested by the division of motor vehicles, or that the applicant is not entitled to the issuance of registration of the vehicle under chapters 3 — 9 of this title;
      </li>
      <li id="t31c03s31-3-5ol12">
       That the vehicle is mechanically unfit or unsafe to be operated upon the highways;

      <li id="t31c03s31-3-5ol13">
       That the division of motor vehicles has reasonable ground to believe that the vehicle is a stolen or embezzled vehicle, or that the granting of registration would constitute a fraud against the rightful owner;
      </li>
      <li id="t31c03s31-3-5ol14">
       That the registration of the vehicle stands suspended or revoked for any reason as provided in the motor vehicle laws of this state;

       That the vehicle has been reported by any city or town to the division of motor vehicles as having unpaid fines in the aggregate amount of two hundred dollars ($200) or more, including any and all interest, penalties, or other monetary amount that may be imposed for failure to pay the fines by a specified date; provided, the registration shall be issued upon presentation of proof of payment of the outstanding fines, including any and all interest, penalties, or other monetary amount owed to the cities or towns reporting the unpaid fines. When the division of motor vehicles denies a registration to any person pursuant to this subsection, the city or town requesting the denial of registration shall add a five-dollar ($5.00) fee to the aggregate value of the sum of the fines and, upon payment, shall transmit the fee to the division of motor vehicles. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any vehicle owned by a rental company, as defined in § 31-34.1-1;

        Defendant contended that the complaint is duplicitous because the statute being in the disjunctive, a violation thereof must be charged in the conjunctive, but the defendant’s contention was rejected as the averments of the complaint were properly couched in the disjunctive since the statute in question created but one offense and not several distinct offenses.

        Where defendant, who was charged with violation of this section in that in response to demand for his registration card looked in billfold and in car glove compartment but did not produce it and said he did not have either his registration card or his operator’s license and that both were at home, on appeal of conviction of violation of § 31-10-25 had such conviction upheld, the court finding the evidence properly admitted and sufficient to support decision of lower court; since defendant was tried on both complaints together the supreme court cannot say that the evidence supporting his conviction was clearly wrong.

        A secured party’s failure to perfect her security interest according to the methods prescribed in this section precluded a finding that she had a perfected security interest in two automobiles, where all of the statutory sections under which she claimed to have perfected her security interest (perfection by possession, § 6A-9-305; filing in advance of perfection, § 6A-9-312(5)(a); and good faith filing in an improper place, § 6A-9-401(2)) were preempted by this section. Her security interest in the automobiles was therefore not protected under local law against a subsequent lien creditor and was not a security interest entitled to priority over a federal tax lien.

It was intended to no longer permit such retailers to act as authorized collectors of sales and use taxes on behalf of the state but that they could continue to issue temporary certificates of registration notwithstanding such enactment.

        Where the city council, after its first denial of a second-hand dealer’s license was quashed as an abuse of discretion, again denied the application for a license and, in an action for mandamus, raises for the first time the issue that it is without jurisdiction to issue such a license because the state has, by this chapter, pre-empted the right to issue such licenses, the court will not consider such question, but require the council to consider the applicant’s petition and to act reasonably in the matter.

The order to show cause may be served on any person, firm, corporation, or association named in it by any person in the same manner that a summons in a civil action may be served, or by mailing a copy of the order to the person at any address at which he or she has done business or at which he or she lives. If at the hearing the department shall be satisfied that the person is in fact violating any provision of this chapter, then the department shall order the person in writing to cease and desist from the violation. All these hearings shall be conducted in accordance with chapter 35 of title 42. If the person shall subsequently fail to comply with the order of the department, the superior court for Providence County shall have jurisdiction upon the complaint of the department to restrain and enjoin the person from violating this chapter.

For the protection of purchasers with respect to the sale of motor vehicles having altered or reset odometers, licensed motor vehicle dealers are directly responsible to their retail/wholesale customers to repurchase the motor vehicles bearing altered or reset odometers for the original selling price paid by the customer, or an amount as determined by the department.

A “Stop-Sale” shall be defined as a notification issued by a vehicle manufacturer to its franchised dealerships stating that certain used vehicles in inventory shall not be sold or leased, at retail and/or wholesale, due to a federal safety recall for a defect or a noncompliance, or a federal or California emissions recall.

Claims shall be either approved or disapproved within thirty (30) days after they are submitted to the manufacturer in the manner and on the forms the manufacturer reasonably prescribes.

Any claim not specifically disapproved in writing within thirty (30) days after the manufacturer receives a properly submitted claim shall be deemed to be approved.

        A trial court erred when it dismissed a dealer from a lawsuit based on the lemon law on the mere grounds that, as a matter of law, it could not find the dealer liable for refunding the purchase price or replacing the nonconforming vehicle, since the dealer’s inability to cure the alleged defects is a predicate to any return of the vehicle or refund of the purchase price, and since, as the manufacturer’s authorized agent within the state, the dealer is the manufacturer for purposes of securing compliance with the lemon law as far as consumers are concerned.

     <p>
      If a manufacturer has established an informal dispute settlement procedure which complies in all respects with the provisions of 16 CFR Part 703, or which has been approved by the federal trade commission or by the attorney general of this state, the provisions of § 31-5.2-3 concerning refunds or replacement shall not apply to any consumer or lessee who has not first resorted to that manufacturer’s procedure or to the procedure set forth in § 31-5.2-7.1. This section shall not apply unless the manufacturer, its agents, or its authorized dealer or lessor shall have provided the consumer or lessee with clear and conspicuous written notice of the procedure at the time of delivery of the motor vehicle. A decision resulting from an informal dispute settlement procedure shall be binding upon the manufacturer if the consumer or lessee elects to accept the decision. The manufacturer shall perform its obligations as set forth in the decision within a reasonable period of time not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days from the rendering of the decision. In no event shall a consumer or lessee who has resorted to an informal dispute settlement procedure be precluded from seeking the rights and/or remedies provided by this chapter. Any applicable statute of limitation including, but not limited to, that set forth in § 31-5.2-12 shall be tolled during the period from the initiation of a dispute settlement procedure until thirty (30) days following the rendering of a final decision in the process.

       In addition to any settlement procedure provided for in § 31-5.2-7, the department of the attorney general shall provide an independent arbitration procedure for the settlement of disputes between consumers or lessees and manufacturers concerning motor vehicles which do not conform to all applicable express or implied warranties. There shall be established the motor vehicle arbitration board which shall consist of five (5) members. The board shall consist of the attorney general or his or her designee, who shall serve as director, a member of the general public appointed by the attorney general, the director of the department of revenue or his or her designee, the president of the Rhode Island Automobile Dealers’ Association or his or her designee, and the administrator of the division of motor vehicles or his or her designee, only one of whom shall be directly involved in the manufacture, distribution, sale, lease, or service of any automobile product. Members shall be persons interested in consumer disputes, and shall serve without compensation.

       An owner or lessee of any motor vehicle purchased or leased which fails to conform to the applicable express or implied warranties may either initiate a request with the department of attorney general for arbitration by the motor vehicle arbitration board or take part in the settlement procedure set forth in § 31-5.2-7 if in existence. The consumer or lessee shall set forth, on a complaint form prescribed by the department of attorney general, any information he or she deems relevant to the resolution of the dispute and shall file the complaint with a nonrefundable filing fee of twenty dollars ($20.00). The attorney general shall decide if the complaint is eligible under chapter 5.2 of this title. Upon acceptance of the complaint, the attorney general shall notify the manufacturer of the filing of a request for arbitration and shall obtain from the manufacturer, in writing on a form prescribed by the attorney general, any information the manufacturer deems relevant to the resolution of the dispute. The manufacturer shall return the form, along with a non-refundable fifty dollar ($50.00) filing fee, within twenty (20) days of receipt. The department of attorney general shall then refer the matter to the motor vehicle arbitration board created pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.

         If the decision is favorable to the consumer or lessee, the manufacturer shall within thirty (30) days after the rendering of the decision, either comply with the terms of the decision if the consumer or lessee elects to accept the decision or appeal the finding to superior court. No appeal by a manufacturer shall be heard unless the petition for such appeal is filed with the clerk of the superior court within thirty (30) days of issuance of the finding of the motor vehicle arbitration board and is accompanied by a bond in a principal sum equal to the money award made by the state-certified arbitrator plus two thousand five-hundred dollars ($2,500) for anticipated attorneys’ fees, secured by cash or its equivalent, payable to the consumer. The liability of the surety of any bond filed pursuant to this section shall be limited to the indemnification of the consumer in the action. Such bond shall not limit or impair any right of recovery otherwise available pursuant to law, nor shall the amount of the bond be relevant in determining the amount of recovery to which the consumer shall be entitled. In the event that any motor vehicle arbitration board decision, resulting in an award of a refund or replacement, is upheld by the court, recovery by the consumer shall include continuing damages in the amount of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per day for each day, subsequent to the day the motor vehicle was returned to the manufacturer pursuant to § 31-5.2-3, that said vehicle was out of use as a direct result of any nonconformity not issuing from owner negligence, accident, vandalism or any attempt to repair or substantially modify the vehicle by a person other than the manufacturer, its agent or authorized dealer; provided, however, that the manufacturer did not make a comparable vehicle available to the consumer free of charge. In addition to any other recovery, any prevailing consumer shall be awarded reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. If the court finds that the manufacturer did not have any reasonable basis for its appeal or that the appeal was frivolous, the court shall double the amount of the total award made to the consumer. The motor vehicle arbitration board shall contact the consumer or lessee, within ten (10) working days after the date for performance, to determine whether performance has occurred.

Refunds shall be made to the consumer and lienholder, if any, as their interests may appear on the records of ownership kept by the division of motor vehicles. If the amount to be refunded to the lienholder will be insufficient to discharge the lien, the dealer shall notify the consumer in writing by registered or certified mail that the consumer has thirty (30) days to pay the lienholder the amount which, together with the amount to be refunded by the dealer, will be sufficient to discharge the lien. The notice to the consumer shall contain conspicuous language warning the consumer that failure to pay those funds to the lienholder within thirty (30) days will terminate the dealer’s obligation to provide a refund. If the consumer fails to make the payment within thirty (30) days, the dealer shall have no further responsibility to provide a refund under this section. Alternatively, the dealer may elect to offer to replace the used motor vehicle with a comparably priced vehicle, with any adjustment in price that the parties may agree to. The consumer shall not be obligated to accept a replacement vehicle, but may instead elect to receive the refund provided under this section. It shall be an affirmative defense to any claim under this section that:

      </p>
      <ol type="a">
       <li id="t31c6.1s31-6.1-1aIol1a">
        Purposes of agreement.  It is the purpose of this agreement to set up a system by which any contracting state may permit owners of fleets of buses operating in two or more states to prorate the registration of the buses in such fleets in each state in which the fleets operate on the basis of the proportion of miles operated within such state to total fleet miles, as defined in this agreement.
       </li>
       <li id="t31c6.1s31-6.1-1aIol1b">
        Principle of proration of registration.  It is declared that in making this agreement the contracting states adhere to the principle that each state should have the freedom to develop the kind of highway user tax structure that it determines to be most appropriate to itself; that the method of taxation of interstate buses should not be a determining factor in developing its user tax structure; and that annual taxes or other taxes of the fixed fee type upon buses, which are not imposed on a basis that reflects the amount of highway use, should be apportioned among the states, within the limits of practicality, on the basis of vehicle miles traveled within each of the states.

      Every nonresident operator, who is charged by a member of the state police or by a member of the police department of any city or town of this state with a violation of any provision of chapters 14, 15, and 16 of this title, except for a violation included under chapter 41 of this title, may be required to deposit in escrow the sum of twenty-five dollars ($25.00), or to post a proper bond for that amount, with the state or local police department preferring the charge as a prerequisite to the nonresident operator being released for appearance at a later date before the court of proper jurisdiction upon the charge. The deposit so posted shall be returned to the nonresident, or the bond so posted shall be cancelled, upon the nonresident’s appearance before the court of proper jurisdiction for the disposition of the offense charged and effectuation of sentence, if any. If the nonresident shall fail to appear before the court of proper jurisdiction on the date and at the time assigned for the disposition of the offense charged, the deposit or bond, as the case may be, shall be forfeited and paid over to the clerk of court to be disbursed as if the defendant had been convicted and a fine and costs equal to that sum had been imposed.

      Any person who drives a vehicle, not his or her own, without the consent of its owner or lessee, and with intent temporarily to deprive the owner or lessee of his or her possession of the vehicle, without intent to steal the vehicle, is guilty of a felony. The consent of the owner or lessee of a vehicle to its taking or driving shall not in any case be presumed or implied because of the owner’s or lessee’s consent on a prior occasion to the taking or driving of that vehicle by the same or a different person. Any person who assists in, or is a party or accessory to or an accomplice in any unauthorized taking or driving, is guilty of a felony. Any person convicted of a violation of this section shall be fined not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000) or imprisoned for a term of not more than five (5) years, or both.

        The offense of possession of a stolen vehicle, which does not require proof of the element of driving, is a wholly distinct and separate offense from, and thus not a lesser included offense of, driving without consent, which does not require judicial determination of whether the defendant possessed a vehicle he knew or had reason to know was stolen.

        Since circumstantial evidence suggested that the defendant removed the car from a sale lot and retained possession of it for the time it was missing, it could be reasonably inferred that he drove the car off the lot and subsequently returned it after he had failed to obtain the vehicle’s bill of sale.

        In a prosecution for driving a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner under this section, the defendant was not the “owner” of the vehicle under § 31-1-17(b) (now (e)) even though he paid a $250 deposit, which took the car off the market but which did not operate to transfer ownership, and since no conditional sales contract existed transferring possession of the vehicle.

        Trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying a defendant’s motion to reduce sentence because the two and one-half year difference between his sentence for breaking and entering and his co-hort’s sentence was not disproportionate as they did not have to receive equal sentences and their were departure factors applicable to the defendant, which the trial justice justified in his findings such as the defendant being a career criminal, the crime turned into one of violence, he lacked remorse, and he had lied on the stand. Further, the trial court did not err by ordering the sentences for the breaking and entering, consipracy to commit breaking and entering, simple assault, and driving a motor vehicle without the permission of the owner to run consecutively rather than concurrently since the trial court justified its order by finding that it was not just a run-of-the-mill breaking and entering, the lives of the victims were changed forever, the defendant had no remorse for the crimes, and took no personal responsibility for his actions.

       <p>
        The primary purpose of the licensing procedure is to exclude from the highways those operating motor vehicles who have not established their compliance with some minimal standards of competence and skill in the operation of vehicles and thereby secure the safety of the traveling public, and the provision of § 31-10-27 that the license be carried on the person is related to that purpose.

     <p>
      Every operator’s and chauffeur’s first license to operate a motor vehicle shall be by the issuance of a temporary license for the period beginning at the date of issuance and expiring on the birthday of the licensee in the second year following the issuance of the temporary license. Every operator’s and chauffeur’s license issued after expiration of the temporary license shall expire on the birthday of the licensee in the fifth year following the issuance of the license, with the exception of any person seventy-five (75) years of age or older whose license shall expire on the birthday of the licensee in the second year following the issuance of the license, and shall be renewable on or before expiration upon application and payment of the fee required by this chapter. The administrator of the division of motor vehicles, having good cause to believe the applicant for renewal is incompetent or otherwise not qualified, may require an examination of the applicant as upon an original application; provided, however, if the renewal applicant is applying for a commercial driver’s license and is in possession of a valid medical examination certificate issued pursuant to federal motor carrier safety regulations

      -391.49 that applicant shall be deemed to be competent and qualified under this chapter. The administrator of the division of motor vehicles is authorized to adopt any regulations necessary to carry out the purposes of this section. Violations of this section are subject to fines enumerated in § 31-41.1-4.

        The department of administration does not have the discretion to exempt an applicant for renewal of a chauffeur’s license from the minimum vision requirements established for the issuance of such licenses, and therefore did not err in refusing to consider evidence of an applicant’s ability to operate a motor vehicle safely despite his failing eyesight.

        As flying objects, such as loose stones kicked up by passing vehicles or windblown tree branches, striking the operator of a motorcycle in the head could cause him to lose control of his cycle and become a menace to other vehicles on the highway, this section bears a reasonable relation to highway safety generally and, therefore, is not unconstitutional as an improper exercise of the police power of the state attempting to protect people from the consequences of their own carelessness.

        The word “helmet” when considered in the context of this section is sufficiently definite in meaning to prevent this section from being unconstitutional as improper delegation of police power to the registrar on the theory that it would permit regulations calling for helmets of glass, papier-maché, or concrete, useless for the purpose of safety, or require helmets of such materials and construction as to serve only decorative purposes.

        The registrar may adopt standards and specifications for helmets that have their origin elsewhere if he finds them proper for use in this state and the fact that they originated elsewhere and that he relied on the expertise of others does not amount to a delegation of authority so that a conviction for operating a motorcycle on the highway without wearing a helmet is valid under this section.

Pursuant to §§ 31-2-4, 42-35-3(b), and 42-35-4(b)(2), the department of revenue shall adopt and establish the following rules and regulations regarding voluntary termination of operators’ and chauffeurs’ licenses. Any and all regulations previously promulgated for this purpose are rescinded.

        Photostatic copy of a conviction for driving while intoxicated in New Hampshire, which contained the signature of the director of the New Hampshire division of motor vehicles and had been transmitted to the Rhode Island division of motor vehicles by the state of New Hampshire in accordance with the Interstate Driver License Compact, provided adequate notice of a foreign conviction to support suspension of a Rhode Island driver’s license.

        Under this section and § 31-11-7(a)(7), a licensee is to be afforded a postsuspension hearing within 20 days of receipt by the registry of the request therefor, and the hearing is to focus exclusively upon whether such suspension is necessary in order to protect public safety and welfare, relying upon its findings of the circumstances under which the offense was committed, the likelihood of recurrence and the deterrent effect that might reasonably be expected therefrom.

        Former subsection (a)(2), which allowed the registry to suspend a driver’s license without a preliminary hearing simply because the driver has been involved in an accident involving the injury or death of another person, was unconstitutional. Given the registry’s wide discretion under this statute, due process would appear to require that the driver, at minimum, have an opportunity for a hearing before a license may be suspended.

        The fact that a district court judge improperly treated a case as a financial-responsibility appeal under former § 31-31-2, rather than an appeal from a suspension for reckless driving under this section, did not require reversal of the suspension, where the hearing officer properly affirmed the original suspension in light of the defendant’s failure to present mitigating evidence, and the district court’s denial of an appeal was correct.

      Any person aggrieved by any order of the administrator of the division of motor vehicles may appeal that order to the sixth division of the district court by filing, within ten (10) days from the date of the notice to that person of the issuance of the order, a petition in that court stating the grounds upon which the appeal is taken. Upon the filing of the petition and tendering a twenty-five dollar ($25.00) filing fee, the court shall cause thirty (30) days’ notice of the pendency of the hearing to be given to the division of motor vehicles by serving the administrator of the division of motor vehicles, in the manner in which subpoenas in equity are served, with a certified copy of the petition. The petition shall follow the course of equity so far as it is applicable. Upon hearing this petition the court may review the evidence taken at a hearing, investigator’s reports, or other information upon which the administrator’s action was taken, and may in its discretion, affirm, or overrule or modify the order of the administrator of the division of motor vehicles. However, the taking of the appeal shall not operate as a stay of the order of the administrator of the division of motor vehicles from which the appeal is taken, and the order shall remain in full force and effect during the pendency of the appeal. A party aggrieved by a final order of the court may seek appellate review of the order pursuant to the procedures set forth in § 42-35-16.

        The state may prohibit unlicensed drivers from operating a motor vehicle on the state’s public highways as a valid exercise of the state’s police power. Furthermore, it is evident that R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-11-18 is rationally related to the state’s legitimate interest in maintaining the safety of its public thoroughfares. Section 31-11-18 is constitutional as applied to motor-vehicle operators on this state’s public highways, including the defendant, regardless of his unwillingness to recognize the federal government.

        Superior court erred in dismissing the charges against defendant for driving under the influence of liquor resulting in serious bodily injury, driving so as to endanger resulting in serious bodily injury, and driving with a revoked license because an operator may be distinct and separate from a driver in certain circumstances, and by forcibly seizing control of a moving vehicle when he jumped up from the backseat and grabbed the steering wheel—thus divesting the driver of control—and steering the vehicle off the highway, causing a roll-over crash, defendant placed himself squarely in the realm of an operator of a vehicle.

        In a prosecution for driving with a suspended license, a driver’s abstract from the Registry of Motor Vehicles was clearly admissible under Rules 901(b)(7) and 902(4) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, and was not excluded under Rule 803(8)(B) because it did not contain information observed by police officers or law-enforcement personnel. Also, the admission of this abstract did not violate the defendant’s right to confrontation under the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions by allowing, in effect, New York officials to testify about violations in that state. The report did not contain any statements by New York officials, only a notation of the New York violation. State v. D'Alo,

        The driver of an emergency vehicle is not entitled to a per se exemption from traffic speed regulations. A question of fact that must be determined first is whether a vehicle qualifies as an emergency vehicle under the statute and if an emergency exists, whether the driver’s conduct in the emergency constitutes a reckless disregard for the safety of others, and if no emergency exists the standards applicable to any other driver, as to whether he was negligent, apply to the driver.

        Collectively, Rhode Island’s statutory and common law schemes indicate that the control and regulation of traffic is a duty allocated to the government, not to private individuals, such that no duty exists for an abutting landowner to control traffic on a public highway. Ferreira v. Strack,

        This section speaks in permissive rather than mandatory terms. In short, the placing of traffic-control signals is a discretionary act for which no statutory duty or liability has been imposed. Polaski v. O'Reilly,

        City had no statutory duty to place a stop sign at the intersection where the accident occurred, because R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-13-3 gave the city the discretionary authority to do so where it thought signs were necessary. Hudson v. City of Providence,

        The presumption of regularity is available to establish essential elements in a prosecution for violation of the Motor Vehicle Code Act, so the court sustained defendant’s conviction based solely upon an officer’s testimony that defendant had gone through a flashing red light without requiring the state to introduce evidence that the signal was placed and maintained pursuant to statutory authorization.

        Summary judgment for a city is affirmed in a motorist’s personal injury action where the city is alleged to have been negligent in that it allowed a stop sign at the intersection to be mutilated beyond recognition and to become obstructed from view by trees, brush, and bushes.

        It was within the authority of the legislature under the police power to fix a standard of care. The prima facie limit may be taken into account by the jury as evidence of excessive speed over and above the reasonable and prudent speed.

        Contention of appellant that appellee’s speed at time of an intersectional collision, being in excess of the posted limits under the weather and driving conditions then existing, would be prima facie evidence of operation at an unreasonable speed, could not be held as so by the court, for to reach such conclusion the trial justice would of necessity have to draw an inference from the evidence favorable to the party moving for a directed verdict, whereas under the settled rule only inferences may be drawn as are favorable to the unmoving party.

        Where defendant came over the crest of a hill on a rainy night and was unable to stop when he saw stopped vehicles blocking a portion of the road, the trial judge properly refused to charge the sudden emergency doctrine which holds a party to an accident blameless when he is confronted with a sudden emergency not created by him which he could not have reasonably foreseen.

     <p>
      A two-way left turn lane may be designated near the center of a roadway for use by vehicles making left turns in both directions from or into the roadway.
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t31c15s31-15-19ol11">
       Two-way left turn lanes shall be designated by distinctive roadway markings consisting of parallel double yellow lines, interior line dashed and exterior line solid on each side of the lane. The department of transportation may determine and prescribe standards and specifications governing length, width, and positioning of the distinctive pavement markings. All pavement markings designating a two-way left turn lane shall conform to the department of transportation’s standards and specifications.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c15s31-15-19ol12">
       A vehicle shall not be driven in a designated two-way left turn lane except when preparing for or making a left turn from or into a highway or when preparing for or making a U-turn when otherwise permitted by law, and shall not be driven in that lane for more than two hundred feet (200´) while preparing for and making the turn or while preparing to merge into the adjacent lanes of travel. A left turn or U-turn shall not be made from any other lane where a two-way left turn lane has been designated.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c15s31-15-19ol13">
       This section shall not prohibit driving across a two-way left turn lane.

       Raised pavement markers may be used to simulate painted lines described in this section when such markers are placed in accordance with standards established by the department of transportation.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c15s31-15-19ol15">
       Upon any vehicle entering the turn lane, no other vehicle proceeding in the opposite direction shall enter that turn lane if that entrance would prohibit the vehicle already in the lane from making the intended turn.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c15s31-15-19ol16">
       When vehicles enter the turn lane proceeding in opposite directions, the first vehicle to enter the lane shall have the right-of-way.

        An instruction which quoted all but the final sentence of subdivision (2) and concluded with, “That means in common ordinary practice you take a square corner from the right side of the roadway from where you are square to the right side of the roadway that you’re entering”, while imprecise, was hardly erroneous in the absence of evidence in the record locating the point of collision to the left of the center of the intersection.

        Where the plaintiff testified that she looked to the left, but did not see defendant’s automobile approaching from that direction, and ran across the street in an unmarked crosswalk to board a bus waiting for her on the other side and ran into defendant’s car, it was not error to refuse to instruct the jury on the doctrine of last clear chance.

The general assembly further declares that it is in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare that the rental of motorized bicycles, motor scooters and motorized tricycles in the town of New Shoreham be supervised, regulated, and controlled in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

        When they are read together, it becomes obvious that §§ 31-20-11, 31-20-13 and this section were enacted to protect schoolchildren entering and exiting flashing schoolbuses stopped on highways where pedestrians are allowed to cross; not to protect adult motorists in vehicles further down the road. Hence, the jury may be instructed that a violation of this section may be considered as evidence that a duty owed to schoolchildren was breached, but not that a duty to another motorist located down the road was breached.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The general assembly declares that the use of racial profiling for stopping or searching motorists on our public highways is against public policy and violates the civil rights of the motorist. For purposes of this chapter, “racial profiling” means the detention, interdiction or other disparate treatment of an individual on the basis, in whole or in part, of the racial or ethnic status of such individual, except when such status is used in combination with other identifying factors in seeking to apprehend a specific suspect whose racial or ethnic status is part of the description of the suspect. The purpose of this chapter is to conduct a study of the traffic stops by the police to determine whether racial profiling is occurring and to require that police prohibit the practice of racial profiling.

      No state or municipal law enforcement officer or law enforcement agency shall engage in racial profiling. For purposes of this chapter, “racial profiling” means the detention, interdiction or other disparate treatment of an individual on the basis, in whole or in part, of the racial or ethnic status of such individual, except when such status is used in combination with other identifying factors seeking to apprehend a specific suspect whose racial or ethnic status is part of the description of the suspect, which description is timely and reliable.

       <p>
        Defendant left his motor vehicle on the hospital grounds unlocked and unattended, where it was driven off by some unauthorized person, who collided with plaintiff’s automobile. Defendant’s original act of negligence will be considered as a remote and not a proximate cause of plaintiff’s injury when there is an intervening act on the part of a responsible third person.

        Where defendant parked his car on a steep hill without turning the wheels into the curb and left it with the motor running and two young girls got into the car to wait for him and, while waiting, wrestled with each other, thereby accidentally disturbing the emergency brake so that the car rolled down the hill and struck another parked car, the trial court was warranted in finding that defendant’s negligence in so parking his car was not the proximate cause of the accident.

     <p>
      Every motor vehicle shall at all times be equipped with a muffler in good working order and in constant operation to prevent excessive or unusual noise and annoying smoke. No person shall use a muffler cutout, bypass, or similar device upon a motor vehicle on a highway. Any exhaust system shall be deemed defective if any changes, modifications, alterations, deletions, or adjustments have been made which would cause the exhaust system to generate a higher or louder sound level than would be generated by the exhaust system customarily installed by the manufacturer as original equipment. The defective exhaust system shall be replaced or repaired to restore the exhaust system to the performance specifications of the original equipment. Failure to replace or restore the exhaust system as required in this section within five (5) days shall be deemed a civil violation and violators are subject to fines enumerated in § 31-41.1-4.

       Each school bus shall be equipped with at least two (2) flat-surfaced rectangular exterior mirrors, one situated on each side of the bus forward of the operator and any entrance door. The reflecting surface shall not be obscured and shall have a minimum reflective surface of fifty square inches (50 sq. in.). The mirrors shall be firmly supported and adjustable, and shall afford the driver a clear, stable, reflected view of the road surface at each side of the vehicle for a continual distance beginning at a point not greater than two hundred feet (200´) to the rear and continuing to the horizon when measured on a straight and level road.

        The circumstances support a reasonable inference that the attorney knew of the collision wherein the attorney was required to stop, to conduct a diligent search for a possible victim and to render reasonable aid.

        The term “accident” in this section includes all collisions, intentional as well as unintentional. Therefore, a defendant can be found guilty of both the intentional act of assault and the act of leaving the scene of an accident. State v. Sabetta,

        Although the trial justice indicated he would have trouble finding proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew he had come in contact with the victim, he denied the defendant’s motion for a new trial on the basis that reasonable minds could fairly come to a different conclusion and he could not find the jury’s verdict to be unsupported by the evidence. The trial justice correctly applied the proper standard as there was sufficient evidence along with reasonable inferences flowing therefrom supporting the jury’s finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

        In a case alleging the offense of driving so as to endanger with death resulting, the negligence of the victim is irrelevant unless it can be found that the conduct of the victim is an independent, intervening, and efficient cause of his or her own death which constitutes the sole proximate cause of the fatality. In this case, the conduct of the defendant in swerving into the breakdown land and striking the victim, who was clearly visible from one-half to one-eighth mile from the point of impact, was the proximate cause of the fatality. Therefore, the trial court was correct in refusing to give an instruction about the direction joggers are required to run. State v. Harrington,

        Superior court erred in dismissing the charges against defendant for driving under the influence of liquor resulting in serious bodily injury, driving so as to endanger resulting in serious bodily injury, and driving with a revoked license because an operator may be distinct and separate from a driver in certain circumstances, and by forcibly seizing control of a moving vehicle when he jumped up from the backseat and grabbed the steering wheel—thus divesting the driver of control—and steering the vehicle off the highway, causing a roll-over crash, defendant placed himself squarely in the realm of an operator of a vehicle.

        The trier of fact may draw an inference from the results of a breathalyzer test that the blood-alcohol concentration at the time of the test was the same as at the time of actual driving and that the intervention of expert testimony to extrapolate the results of the test back to the time of driving is not required. The defendant may offer evidence to rebut this presumption that the blood alcohol concentration at the time of the testing was as great at the time of actual driving. State v. Lusi,

        Failure to follow a procedural “checklist” in administering the chemical test does not per se render invalid the results of the chemical test; rather, it must be demonstrated that the deviation from the “checklist” actually affected the validity of the test results.

        Since the pertinent department of health regulations promulgated under this section are silent in respect to the timing of the removal and insertion of the mouthpieces between breath samples, and since no evidence was presented to show that the timing of the removal and insertion of the mouthpieces affects the validity of the breathalyzer test, it was error to hold the results of the test in this case inadmissible.

        Trial court erred in rejecting the department of health’s interpretation of the regulation that was authorized under § 31-27-2(c)(4) (now see § 31-27-2(c)(5)), regarding the testing of breath-test equipment; the interpretation was reasonable, since it adhered to the equipment manufacturer’s standards and to the statutory purpose for testing.

        Evidence presented by the prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the foundational requirements established by R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-27-2(c)(4) and (5), and a trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the prosecution had met its burden of proof pursuant to
        <cite class="ocri">
         R.I. R. Evid. 104
        </cite>
        (a), such that denial of defendant’s motion in limine to exclude the breathalyzer test results, granting the prosecution’s motion in limine to admit those results, and denying defendant’s suppresision motion was proper; defendant offered no evidence to rebut the prosecution’s evidence concerning the foundational requirements.

       <p>
        Since a trial court properly deferred to the Department of Health’s interpretation of its own regulations and it was probable that defendant’s blood alcohol level was higher than reported by the breath test, it correctly rejected defendant’s arguments that a blood alcohol result should be suppressed in regard to a R.I.

        A finding that the defendant voluntarily consented to a blood alcohol test is not clearly wrong, where the record indicates that he was informed of his rights and that he acknowledged both orally and in writing that he understood his rights, and where the record is devoid of any evidence that he ever expressed a desire to refuse to take a breath test.

        In a prosecution under this section, it was error to exclude breathalyzer test results on the basis that the defendant’s consent to the test was not valid because he was not advised that an out-of-state conviction of driving under the influence could be used to enhance the penalty for a subsequent Rhode Island conviction for the same offense.

        In a criminal case for operating a motor vehicle on a public highway while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, defendant was not prejudiced by testimony of arresting officer that defendant was in a condition unfit to operate a car, officer having been permitted to testify as to his previous experience in examining persons.

        Testimony of an examining physician, based upon tests and observations, that the defendant was under the influence of liquor and unfit to operate a vehicle constituted evidence which was susceptible of the reasonable inference on the part of the jury that the extent of defendant’s intoxication was sufficient to render him incapable of safely operating his motor vehicle.

        Although the rights form the defendant signed warned of a minor monetary sanction that is no longer in effect and although the police inadvertently omitted to note on the form the defendant’s right to an additional chemical test, these errors were de minimis and certainly did not warrant suppression of the chemical test results.

        There could be no sufficient evidence to support drunk driving charges against a defendant whose blood alcohol was never measured under a version of the statute that based all the penalties on particular blood alcohol levels; since penal statutes had to be strictly construed, the trial court should not have attempted to fill the gap in the legislation by deciding that it allowed the appropriateness of a particular penalty to be determined in other ways.

        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of driving under the influence of alcohol because the trial justice recalled defendant’s and his girlfriend’s testimony that, when stopped, they were traveling from a party where defendant drank alcohol; defendant was driving on a public street in Rhode Island; the lieutenant testified that he smelled alcohol on defendant’s breath, and observed bloodshot eyes and slurred speech; and a blood alcohol test revealed an alcohol content of .097 grams per deciliters (.097 percent), which exceeded the .08 percent minimum statutory amount.

        A lawful stop on suspicion of driving under the influence triggers the application of this section. Therefore, when the arresting officer clearly had a reasonable suspicion that the defendant was under the influence, and the defendant refused to take a breathalyzer test, it was error to dismiss the breathalyzer-refusal charge based on the defendant’s claim that his erratic driving and other conduct were the results of medication and not of alcohol consumption. State v. Bruno,

        Traffic tribunal’s dismissal of defendant’s infraction under R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-27-2.3 for refusal to submit to a preliminary breath test did not collaterally estop superior court prosecution for refusal to submit to a chemical test under R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-27-2.1, because (1) while the State had to prove an officer reasonably believed an operator operated a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs for both crimes, there was no identity of issues, as an operator’s post-arrest behavior irrelevant to the infraction was highly relevant to the chemical test refusal, and (2) the issue as to which defendant sought collateral estoppel was not fully litigated when the traffic tribunal magistrate did not make a specific finding on a material matter of fact.

        District Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the State’s appeal of a decision of the appeals panel of the Traffic Tribunal; R.I. Gen.

        The suspension of a motorist’s registration because of his refusal to submit to a chemical breath test, without any warning that as a consequence of the refusal the motorist’s registration would be suspended, and without the opportunity of a prior hearing, is a denial of due process, and the registration suspension should be voided; however, where the motorist is adequately informed of other penalties he could incur because of his failure to submit to the breathalyzer test, those penalties and the violation should be affirmed.

        In a prosecution under § 31-27-2, it was error to exclude breathalyzer test results on the basis that the defendant’s consent to the test was not valid because he was not advised that an out-of-state conviction of driving under the influence could be used to enhance the penalty for a subsequent Rhode Island conviction for the same offense.

        Suspension of defendant’s driver’s license due to driving under the influence of liquor could be effected without certification of the competency of breathalyzer operator. Vinal v. Petit,

        The findings at a hearing pursuant to subsection (b) may be made upon whatever evidence is adduced at the hearing and are not dependent upon the validity of the sworn report required by subsection (a). Subsection (b), moreover, does not require a hearing judge to find that the sworn report complied with subsection (a). Therefore, the proper procedure under subsection (b) would have provided the state an opportunity to establish the facts necessary under subsection (b) to sustain the driver’s breathalyzer refusal charge notwithstanding the defect in the sworn report. However, where the hearing judge, relying solely upon the sworn report, chose to dismiss the charge prior to taking any evidence, including the state’s evidence that the driver had in fact been informed of the correct fee, error of law was committed.

        The state is not required to establish that there existed probable cause for the police to stop a vehicle in order to meet its burden of proof under this section. It is clear that reasonable suspicion is the proper standard for evaluating the lawfulness of a stop. State v. Jenkins,

        Since the police officer testified that he noticed the defendant’s vehicle twice drift over the center line of the highway upon which she was traveling, both times her vehicle’s left wheels contacting the chatterstrip, and the officer also saw the defendant’s vehicle undertake wide turns while both entering and exiting a parking lot, the facts were sufficient to support a finding by the Administrative Adjudication Court of reasonable suspicion that the defendant had been operating her vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.

        The defendant’s commission of a misdemeanor alone (operation of a unregistered vehicle in violation of § 31-8-2) gave the officer probable cause to stop and detain him, and from that point on, any evidence obtained pursuant to the lawful stop, such as the odor of alcohol, slurred speech, and bloodshot eyes, would in effect be in plain view of the arresting officer and would support an arrest for suspicion of driving while under the influence.

       When a law enforcement officer has reason to believe that a person is driving or in actual physical control of any motor vehicle in this state while under the influence of alcohol, the law enforcement officer may require the person to submit to a preliminary breath analysis for the purpose of determining the person’s blood alcohol content. The breath analysis must be administered immediately upon the law enforcement officer’s formulation of a reasonable belief that the person is driving or in actual control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, or immediately upon the stop of the person, whichever is later in time. Any chemical breath analysis required under this section must be administered with a device and in a manner approved by the director of the department of health for that purpose. The result of a preliminary chemical breath analysis may be used for the purpose of guiding the officer in deciding whether an arrest should be made. When a driver is arrested following a preliminary breath analysis, tests may be taken pursuant to § 31-27-2.1. The results of a preliminary breath test may not be used as evidence in any administrative or court proceeding involving driving while intoxicated or refusing to take a breathalyzer test, except as evidence of probable cause in making the initial arrest.

However, it shall be a defense to a charge of refusing a validly requested preliminary breath analysis that the medical condition of a person precluded the giving of any such test.

        Traffic tribunal’s dismissal of defendant’s infraction under R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-27-2.3 for refusal to submit to a preliminary breath test did not collaterally estop superior court prosecution for refusal to submit to a chemical test under R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-27-2.1, because (1) while the State had to prove an officer reasonably believed an operator operated a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs for both crimes, there was no identity of issues, as an operator’s post-arrest behavior irrelevant to the infraction was highly relevant to the chemical test refusal, and (2) the issue as to which defendant sought collateral estoppel was not fully litigated when the traffic tribunal magistrate did not make a specific finding on a material matter of fact.

        The phrase “caused by the operation of any motor vehicle” in subsection (a) requires the state to prove that the defendant’s manner of operating his or her motor vehicle was a proximate cause of the injury in question. State v. Benoit,
        <cite class="ocri">

       <p>
        Superior court erred in dismissing the charges against defendant for driving under the influence of liquor resulting in serious bodily injury, driving so as to endanger resulting in serious bodily injury, and driving with a revoked license because an operator may be distinct and separate from a driver in certain circumstances, and by forcibly seizing control of a moving vehicle when he jumped up from the backseat and grabbed the steering wheel—thus divesting the driver of control—and steering the vehicle off the highway, causing a roll-over crash, defendant placed himself squarely in the realm of an operator of a vehicle. State v. Peters,

        Superior court did not err in denying defendant’s motion for post-conviction relief because the alleged new evidence would not have changed the verdict at trial; it was of no consequence that defendant’s obstructive sleep apnea might have caused him to operate a motor vehicle dangerously even if he were not under the influence of alcohol because defendant acknowledged in open court that he was legally intoxicated when he caused the deaths of two people through the operation of his motor vehicle. Reise v. State,
        <cite class="ocri">
         913 A.2d 1052
        </cite>
        ,

       <p>
        Since there was scant evidence in the record, other than his presence on the highway, to show that the defendant’s manner of driving was a proximate cause of the death and injury in question and, in fact, there was evidence that the defendant tried to swerve out of the way of an oncoming car, the legally intoxicated defendant was not criminally responsible for the accident.

        The evidence was not such as would have justified the trial justice in ruling as a matter of law that defendant had not been “immediately” informed of his right under this statute within the fair meaning of the word “immediately” as used, when defendant was informed of his right at the scene of the arrest and then a short time later at the police station where defendant availed himself of opportunity to call a doctor of his choice, but the question was one for the jury.

       Any motor vehicle including, but not limited to, cars, trucks, vessels, or motorcycles, which has been or is being used in violation of § 31-27-4.1, may be seized and upon conviction forfeited; provided, that no motor vehicle as enumerated in this section used by any person shall be forfeited under the provisions of this chapter unless it shall appear that the owner of the vehicle had knowledge, actual or constructive, and was a consenting party to the alleged illegal act.

         The motor vehicle taken or detained under this section shall not be repleviable, but shall be deemed to be in the custody of the law enforcement agency making the seizure. Whenever a motor vehicle is forfeited under this chapter it shall be retained and utilized by the law enforcement agency that seized the vehicle where the use of the vehicle is reasonably related to the law enforcement duties of the seizing agency. If the seized vehicle is inappropriate for use by law enforcement agency for reasons including, but not limited to, style, size, or color, the seizing agency shall be allowed to apply the proceeds of sale or the trade-in value of the vehicle towards the purchase of an appropriate vehicle for use for activities reasonably related to law enforcement duties.

Of the remainder, eighty percent (80%) of the proceeds shall be divided among the state and local law enforcement agencies proportionately based upon their contribution to the investigation of the criminal activity related to the asset being forfeited, and twenty percent (20%) of the proceeds shall be provided to the state victims’ indemnity fund.

           Each state or local law enforcement agency shall be entitled to keep the proceeds from sales of forfeited vehicles. The funds shall be used for law enforcement purposes.

The report shall be made in the form and manner that may be provided or specified by the treasurer and the annual law enforcement agency reports as provided in this subsection shall be provided to the local governmental body governing the agency and to the house and senate judiciary committees.

A placard or motorcycle sticker issued to a person whose disability is temporary shall be substantially similar to that issued to a person with a permanent or long term disability. The temporary placard, however, shall be a red placard with a white international symbol of access, certificate number, the words “Rhode Island Disability Parking Permit” and shall bear the expiration dates upon its face. A preliminary placard shall be similar to that issued to a person with a permanent, long-term, or temporary disability. The preliminary placard shall be effective for twenty-one (21) days, and may be issued by an applicant’s licensed physician, if in the medical provider’s opinion the applicant’s medical condition merits the issuance of a preliminary placard while the division considers the applicant’s qualifications for any type of disability parking permit. The preliminary placard shall be an orange placard with a white international symbol of access, certificate number, the words “Rhode Island Disability Parking Permit” and shall bear the expiration date upon its face and shall be displayed on the dashboard of the vehicle in a manner that it is clearly visible from the front. The division of motor vehicles shall promulgate rules governing the issuance and use of preliminary placards. Applicants shall not be charged any fee associated with the issuance of a preliminary placard. Physicians submitting false information to the division of motor vehicles to obtain a preliminary placard on anyone’s behalf may be subject to the penalties set forth in §

The placard shall conform to the Uniform Parking System for Disabled Drivers standard issued by the United States Department of Transportation. If an application for a placard or motorcycle sticker is denied, the division of motor vehicles shall promptly notify the applicant in writing, stating the specific reason(s) for the denial, and advising the applicant of the procedures for requesting a hearing to appeal the denial. Prior to the appeal hearing, the applicant shall be provided with any and all documents relied upon by the division in denying the application. If an application contains a physician certification that the applicant is sufficiently disabled to require a placard or motorcycle sticker, and the division has not provided specific reasons in its denial letter to the applicant, the hearing officer shall summarily order that a placard or motorcycle sticker be provided to the applicant. At all other hearings of application denials where a physician certification has been provided, the division shall bear the burden of proof that the individual is not entitled to a placard or motorcycle sticker pursuant to this chapter.

If an application or subsequent renewal is accompanied by a physician’s certification that the applicant’s condition is a chronic, permanent impairment and that application is approved, then any subsequent renewal shall be authorized upon receipt of a notarized affidavit from the applicant or applicant’s, guardian or legal representative or a certificate from the applicant’s physician that his or her condition has not changed since the previous approval.

At the hearing, the division of motor vehicles shall bear the burden of proof that the individual is not entitled to the placard or motorcycle sticker pursuant to this chapter. There shall be no renewal fee charged for the placards or motorcycle sticker. The division of motor vehicles shall be authorized to issue a temporary disability parking privilege placard or motorcycle sticker immediately upon receipt of an application for individuals with a temporary impairment, as defined in subsection (h) of this section. A temporary placard or motorcycle sticker shall be valid for sixty (60) days from the date of issuance. Temporary placards or motorcycle stickers may be renewed for a period of one year or less, as determined by the medical advisory board upon application if the disability persists. The division of motor vehicles shall subsequently review the applications in accordance with the procedures currently in effect as to applications from persons whose disability is long term. Any issuance which, after subsequent review, shall be found to be inappropriate shall be revoked and notice of the revocation shall be sent to the applicant.

     <p>
      Any person aggrieved by any decision, or order, of the division of motor vehicles, made pursuant to the provisions of chapters 31 — 33 of this title may appeal it to the traffic tribunal by filing, within ten (10) days from the date of the notice to the person of the issuance of the decision, or order, appealed from, a petition in that court stating the ground upon which the appeal is taken. Upon the filing of the petition, the court shall give thirty (30) days’ notice of the pendency of it to the division of motor vehicles by serving the administrator of the division of motor vehicles, in the manner in which subpoenas in equity are served, with a certified copy of the petition and the petition shall follow the course of equity so far as is applicable. Upon hearing the petition the court may review the evidence taken at a hearing, or investigator’s reports, or other information upon which the division’s action was taken and may, in its discretion, affirm or reverse or modify the decision or order, of the division of motor vehicles in whole or in part. The court shall determine whether the filing of the petition shall operate as a stay of the order or act of the administrator of the division of motor vehicles. A party aggrieved by a final order of the court may seek appellate review of it pursuant to the procedures set forth in § 31-41.1-8.

However, a policy subsequently procured and certified shall, on the effective date of its certification, terminate the insurance previously certified with respect to any vehicle designated in both certificates.

      The operator of every motor vehicle which is in any manner involved in an accident within this state, in which any person is killed or injured, or in which damage to the property of any one person, including the operator, in excess of five hundred dollars ($500) is sustained, shall, within twenty-one (21) days after the accident, report the matter in writing to the division of motor vehicles. The report, the form of which shall be prescribed by the division of motor vehicles, shall contain information to enable the division of motor vehicles to determine whether the requirements for the deposit of security under chapters 31 and 32 of this title are inapplicable by reason of the existence of insurance or other exceptions specified in the chapters, and the administrator of the division of motor vehicles may regard the information given as true, until the contrary reasonably appears. If that operator is physically incapable of making the report, the owner of the motor vehicle involved in the accident shall, within twenty-one (21) days after learning of the accident, make the report. The operator or the owner shall furnish any additional relevant information that the division of motor vehicles shall require.

        In an action against an automobile dealer under this section for damages from the operation of an automobile owned by him, where the evidence was that the person who drove the automobile out of the dealer’s place of business had previously road-tested it and another automobile with a view to purchasing one of them and, on the occasion of the accident had road-tested said other automobile before taking out the one involved in the accident, the inference that possession of the car was under agreement of bailment is of such probability as to negative the probative force of the inference reached by the trial court that such possession was merely by consent of the owner and that the operator was the agent of the owner under this section.

        This section abrogates the common-law rule that shielded an automobile owner from liability for the negligence of a person to whom the vehicle was entrusted unless such negligence occurred while the operator was engaged in the owner’s business. It predicates the owner’s liability on the granting of permission to use a potentially dangerous instrumentality. Ostrosky v. Sczapa,

        In vehicle owner 1’s action for damages stemming from a collision, R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 31-33-6 and 31-33-7, a trial court erred in granting summary judgment to vehicle owner 2 because she was the vehicle’s registered owner at the time of the collision, which served as prima facie evidence under § 31-33-7 that she gave consent to the unidentified driver to use her vehicle and owner 2’s submission of an affidavit and a police report created conflicting evidence on the issue of consent, which was a question for a jury to resolve.

        Under the explicit language of R.I. Gen.

        Evidence was insufficient to survive an insurer’s motion for judgment as a matter of law in a victim’s action alleging liability under the statute because the victim’s injuries resulted from a physical altercation with the driver of the insured vehicle at a distance from the vehicle and unrelated to the operation of the vehicle; the mere fact that the driver drove to and from the scene of the incident in the insured vehicle did not establish the causal connection required to impute liability.

        Where a lessee of a private motor vehicle had submitted an affidavit that her son had lacked permission to drive the vehicle in support of her summary judgment motion in another driver’s negligence action, and the lease did not limit who could drive, the lessee and the lessor had failed to meet their burden on summary judgment sufficient to find that there were no genuine issues of material fact for trial as to the lessee’s son’s permission to operate the leased vehicle.

        There is an apparent conflict between the Responsibility of Owners of Rental Vehicles Act (chapter 34 of title 31) and the Motor Vehicle Reparations Act (chapter 47 of title 31), as the former does not require an out-of-state rental vehicle agency to give proof of financial responsibility for vehicles not registered in this state, whereas the latter statute does appear to require such a showing. The former statute, being the more specific, prevails, pursuant to § 43-3-26 (conflicting general and special provisions). Lopes v. Phillips,

        Owners of rental vehicles who possess certificates of self-insurance issued pursuant to § 31-33-9 are still required to prove financial responsibility under this section in order to register their vehicles under this chapter. A certificate of self-insurance issued under § 31-33-9 cannot be used to satisfy the requirements of this section as the general assembly intended all owners of rental vehicles to adhere specifically to the requirements of this chapter and the possession of a self-insurance certificate issued pursuant to a separate statutory provision does not meet the requirements of this section and § 31-34-2.

        The pertinent statutory provisions clearly establish that the duty to file proof of financial responsibility is limited to owners of vehicles that are registered in Rhode Island or that are required to be registered in Rhode Island. Fratus v. Amerco,

       <p>
        This section does not purport to create an independent substantive basis for the owner-lessor’s liability, such as a theory of negligent entrustment. Instead the statute imposes a form of vicarious liability on the owner-lessor based on the operator’s wrongful conduct. DiQuinzio v. Panciera Lease Co.,

        Lessor-liability statute, R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-34-4, clearly and unambiguously provides that any owner of a for hire motor vehicle shall be jointly and severally liable for a consensual operator’s negligence. Oliveira v. Lombardi,

        Because the Division of Motor Vehicles, which is responsible for enforcing R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 31, requires long-term lessors of motor vehicles to provide proof of their financial responsibility before leasing motor vehicles in Rhode Island, and because great weight is attributed to this agency’s construction of R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-34-4, the regulations support the conclusion that long-term lessors are subject to this lessor-liability statute as an additional surety for the satisfaction of a negligence claim.

        Long-term motor-vehicle lease falls within the broad definition of a motor vehicle “for hire,” and owners of motor vehicles for hire are subject to the vicarious liability provision of R.I.

        Where a tortfeasor rented a car in Rhode Island, the Rhode Island statute, R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-34-4, applied to a personal injury action arising out of an accident in Massachusetts to make the rental companies jointly and severally liable with the tortfeasor; therefore, the rental companies’ motion for summary judgment was denied.

        Even though actual accident occurred in New York, Rhode Island law, which precluded liability on the rental car company when the car was driven outside of the terms and conditions of the rental car agreement, was applicable because all of the parties involved were Rhode Island residents, the trip was initiated in Rhode Island, and the trip would have ended in Rhode Island.

        Since it was absolutely clear that a valid and enforceable contract was formed at the time the parties to the releases exchanged promises, even though the injured persons tried to return the $100,000 settlement payment from the driver’s insurer, the lessor of the car which was involved in the accident was no longer exposed to liability.

        Terms “owner” and “lessor” in R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-34-4, regarding the vicarious liability of a vehicle owner, are not limited to entities in the business of renting motor vehicles; rather, they “include” such entities, and, per R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-1-17(b) (now see § 31-1-17(e)), the term “owner” also includes any person who holds legal title to the vehicle. Oliveira v. Lombardi,

        Definition of “lessor” in R.I. Gen.

The estimate shall be made for the month or months in respect to which the person failed to file a report and shall be based upon any information which is in the tax administrator’s possession or may come into the tax administrator’s possession. Upon the basis of this estimate, the tax administrator shall compute and determine the amount required to be paid to the state, adding to the sum thus arrived at a penalty equal to ten percent (10%) of it. One or more determinations may be made for one or for more than one month.

If a refund is so ordered, it shall be paid by the general treasurer upon certification of the tax administrator with the approval of the director of administration.

        The decal-fee requirement under this section as it existed between 1982 and 1987, which applied the fee only to nonresident motor carriers, did not constitute an invalid discriminatory tax under the federal commerce clause, given that the decal fee requirement assisted in the administration of the taxation scheme under this chapter and was fairly related to the services provided by Rhode Island in maintaining and repairing highways, and that resident motor carriers were subject to comparable identification requirements by complying with the annual registration requirements for resident vehicle owners.

        The decal-fee requirement, as it existed under this section between 1982 and 1987, which was applied only to nonresident motor carriers to insure compliance with this chapter, did not violate the privileges and immunities clause of the United States Constitution, given that the plaintiff provided no evidence to indicate that the fee was unnecessary to administer this chapter, or that the purpose of the statute was to punish nonresidents. The fee was a reasonable expense to cover the cost of administering the tax gain. Seibert v. Clark,

       If the administrator is not satisfied with any report or return of a motor carrier subject to the tax imposed by this chapter, or with the amount of the tax to be paid by the motor carrier, the administrator may compute and assess the amount of the tax on the basis of facts contained in the report and return or on the basis of any other information available to the administrator. One or more deficiency assessments may be made with respect to any return for the tax imposed by this chapter.

       The administrator shall give written notice to any motor carrier of the deficiency assessment. If the notice is served by mail, it shall be addressed to the motor carrier at the address appearing in the records of the division of taxation. Except in the case of fraud, intent to evade the provisions of this chapter, or failure to submit a return, the notice of a deficiency assessment shall be mailed within three (3) years after the last day of the month following the quarterly period for which the amount is assessed or within three (3) years after the return for the period is filed, whichever is later.

The order shall contain findings of fact. Failure to comply with an order of attendance may, after notice and hearing, result in the suspension or revocation of a person’s license or registration.

       Unless a judge or magistrate determines that a substantial traffic safety hazard would result from it, he or she may delay for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days the effective date of any suspension or revocation of a driver’s license or vehicle registration imposed pursuant to this chapter. However, the regulations may provide for the immediate surrender of any item to be suspended or revoked and the issuance of appropriate temporary documentation to be used during the thirty-day (30) period. Any order for immediate surrender of a driver’s license or vehicle registration shall contain a statement of reasons for it.

       <p>
        The burden of proof is proof by clear and convincing evidence, while the burden in a civil case is a preponderance of the evidence. Since the burden is greater than in a superior court civil action, the dismissal of a traffic charge may merely mean that the state or the concerned municipality has failed to satisfy the more rigorous burden, rather than that the specific act charged did not occur. Consequently, evidence concerning the ultimate disposition of the traffic charge is properly excluded in a civil case. Cannone v. New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co.,

        In reviewing a hearing judge’s decision pursuant to subsection (l) of former § 31-43-4, the appeals panel lacks the authority to assess witness credibility or to substitute its judgment for that of the hearing judge concerning the weight of evidence on questions of fact. The review of the appeals panel is confined to a reading of the second record to determine whether a judge’s decision is supported by legally competent evidence or is effected by an error of law. Link v. State,

        The Supreme Court review of appeals panel judgments is authorized by subsection (j) of former § 31-43-4, and it must conform to the standards embodied in subsection (f) of former § 31-43-4. The Supreme Court, accordingly, must determine whether the appeals panel has exceeded its authority under subsection (f) of former § 31-43-4. The appeals panel’s decision will not be reversed unless the court decides that the panel misapplied the law, misconceived or overlooked material evidence, or made findings that were clearly wrong (See now § 31-41.1-9(h)).

        Although the issuance of a decision without supporting reasons is discouraged, such a practice clearly comports with subsection (c) of former § 31-43-4, which simply requires the appeal panel, after reviewing an appeal, to file “an appropriate order” in the court records. Link v. State,

     </h3>
     <p>
      It is hereby found and declared that ever-increasing violations of the state’s school-zone speed laws and regulations place both motorists and students using the state’s streets and roadways within school zones in danger. The legislature hereby declares that the use of technology to reduce aggressive and dangerous speeding is in the best interest of public safety and therefore adopts a policy of authorizing the use of automated traffic-speed-enforcement systems in school zones within the state of Rhode Island. These systems shall be used in conjunction with civil penalties imposed upon the owners of speeding vehicles in order to reduce speeding violations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in this chapter shall supersede any criminal or civil penalty or sanction against the driver of a vehicle who is cited by a law enforcement officer for a speeding violation in a school zone.

However, in the case of the same offer made by a prospective buyer who has previously made an offer for which notice to a home owners’ association was required by this section, the right of first refusal shall apply only if the subsequent offer is made more than six (6) months after the earlier offer. The right of first refusal shall not apply with respect to any offer received by the owner for which notice to a home owners’ association is not required pursuant to this section.

       No right of first refusal shall apply to a government taking by eminent domain or negotiated purchase, a forced sale pursuant to a foreclosure, transfer by gift, devise, or operation of law, or a sale to a person who would be included within the table of descent and distribution if there were to be a death intestate of a park owner.

For purposes of this chapter, members of a homeowners’ association and non-members of a homeowners’ association shall not be deemed residents of a similar class.

      The general assembly finds and declares that the provision of affordable housing is of vital concern to the citizens of the state, that mobile and manufactured homes are an important source for affordable housing, that lot rent increases for these homes are a continuing concern for low and moderate income citizens and the elderly, and that some form of limited regulation relative to lot rental increases for mobile and manufactured homes is in the public interest.

       Any person who owns, operates, or maintains a mobile and manufactured home park pursuant to the provisions of chapter 44 of this title shall give the mobile home owners of the park sixty (60) days written notice prior to any lot rent increase going into effect. The written notice shall set forth the current rent, the proposed rent, and the date upon which the increase shall take effect.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c44.1s31-44.1-2ol1b">
       If a majority of the mobile home owners of the park believe that the rent increase is “ excessive” as defined in this section, they may request in writing from the American Arbitration Association that binding arbitration take place between the park owner or operator and the mobile home owners. The association will authenticate on a confidential basis the request and the signatures of a majority of the park mobile home owners, who shall be made aware of the costs involved in seeking binding arbitration under this section. For purposes of determining a majority under this section, there shall be one vote per mobile home unit. The names of the mobile home owners requesting the binding arbitration shall not be disclosed by the American Arbitration Association to the park owner or operator. Upon authentication that a majority of the owners are requesting mediation, the commission shall appoint an impartial and qualified arbitrator, to arbitrate the dispute. The park owner or operator and the mobile home owners will cooperate with the arbitrator in an effort to resolve their differences. The costs and expenses of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the park owner or operator and the mobile home owners.

       An “excessive” rent increase for purposes of this section is an increase which is unreasonable based on the park owner’s or operator’s total expenses, including debt service and a reasonable return on the park owner’s investment or equity in the park, provided, that the debt service is directly related to acquisition of the mobile home park. Debt service used to or otherwise employed for purposes other than that which is directly related to the acquisition or capital management of the mobile home park shall be excluded. Further, the arbitrator shall perform an analysis as to the mobile home park owner’s need for rent increase and services provided to the park. This analysis shall be performed for a period of not less than three (3) years prior to the application for rental increase. Specifically excluded in any such analysis shall be any debt service incurred using the mobile home park as collateral or other security for investment, enterprises, businesses or similar ventures separate and apart from the mobile home park.

       The arbitrator will promptly hear the dispute and render a decision based on the “ excessive” rent increase standard as defined in this section. For purposes of determining a reasonable return on the park owner’s investment or equity, the arbitrator shall perform a risk analysis and consider alternative and comparative investments. The costs of the arbitration shall be borne by the losing party in the arbitration.

      The general assembly finds that abandoned mobile and manufactured homes are a nuisance because they cause blight and depress property values. This act is intended to provide local governments and landowners with the authority to remove abandoned mobile and manufactured homes while protecting property rights.

        There is an apparent conflict between the Responsibility of Owners of Rental Vehicles Act (chapter 34 of title 31) and the Motor Vehicle Reparations Act (chapter 47 of title 31), as the former does not require an out-of-state rental vehicle agency to give proof of financial responsibility for vehicles not registered in this state, whereas the latter statute does appear to require such a showing. The former statute, being the more specific, prevails, pursuant to § 43-3-26 (conflicting general and special provisions). Lopes v. Phillips,

     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t31c47s31-47-1.1ol11">
       Mandatory automobile liability insurance will not guarantee that all drivers will carry automobile liability insurance and in other states with mandatory automobile insurance nearly twenty percent (20%) to twenty-five percent (25%) of drivers do not comply with the state mandate and drive without insurance;
      </li>
      <li id="t31c47s31-47-1.1ol12">
       Because of the evidence described in subdivision (1), Rhode Island drivers will need to carry additional insurance, to protect themselves from harm by uninsured motorists;
      </li>
      <li id="t31c47s31-47-1.1ol13">
       All presently uninsured drivers who try to acquire automobile insurance will be placed in the assigned risk pool regardless of a good driving record, at an excessive rate;
      </li>
      <li id="t31c47s31-47-1.1ol14">
       The state of Rhode Island ranks the eighth (8th) highest in the country for the cost of automobile insurance litigation per capita, this high cost of legal action adds to the already high cost of automobile insurance;
      </li>
      <li id="t31c47s31-47-1.1ol15">
       No-fault insurance can reduce the cost of automobile insurance by reducing litigation and right-to-sue, but evidence also indicates that no-fault insurance can increase the cost of insurance if not properly enacted;
      </li>
      <li id="t31c47s31-47-1.1ol16">
       A proposed rate increase in the Rhode Island Auto Insurance Plan of thirty-four percent (34%) has been granted without full disclosure by insurance companies of their investments, profits, losses, administrative costs and other pertinent information to justify the rate increase;

        The provision of Subdivision (12)(i) requiring that every owner’s policy of liability insurance must provide coverage for damages arising out of bodily injury to any person invalidate family-exclusion provisions. Glaude v. Continental Ins. Co.,

        Although the family-exclusion clause of motor insurance had been rendered void by the passage of the mandatory insurance law, all other provisions of the policy, including the liability coverage limit, were to be enforced in a manner consistent with the parties’ intentions and the law.

        Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, § 34A, which allowed Massachusetts insurers to offer automobile insurance coverage which only applied to losses occurring in Massachusetts, as long as optional coverage for losses occurring outside Massachusetts, as required by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, § 113C, was also offered, did not conflict with the law of Rhode Island, as stated in R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-47-2(13)(i)(A), requiring liability coverage for losses occurring anywhere in North America, or Rhode Island public policy, because neither Rhode Island law or public policy attempted to regulate the contents of insurance policies sold by insurers in other states, so an insured who purchased “Massachusetts-only” coverage and declined additional coverage was not entitled to reformation of his insurance policy when he was involved in an automobile accident in Rhode Island.

        Since prior case law had already determined that public policy concerns did not preclude enforcement of a Massachusetts auto insurance policy limiting liability coverage to accidents that occurred in Massachusetts, the court should have granted an auto insurer’s motion for summary judgment declaring that the insurer did not have to provide coverage for an accident that occurred in Rhode Island; Rhode Island’s own compulsory coverage provisions applied only to cars registered in Rhode Island.

        Where the insurers disputed the amount of their respective liability pursuant to a settlement agreement, the trial court erred in finding that the vehicle owner’s insurer was liable for the first $ 25,000 under R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-47-3.1 and that the insurers were liable on a pro rata basis thereafter, as the insurance policies agreed that the owner’s insurer was the primary insurer, and as a result, the owner’s insurer was liable to the policy limits.

      The director of the department of business regulation, in his or her discretion, may upon the application of a person having registered in his or her name in this state more than twenty-five (25) motor vehicles, issue a certificate of self insurance when he or she is reasonably satisfied that the person is possessed, and will continue to be possessed, of financial ability to respond to judgments obtained against the person arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use, or operation of the person’s motor vehicles. Entities applying to, or previously authorized to, permissibly self-insure are subject to the jurisdiction of the department of business regulation. Upon due notice and hearing, the director of the department of business regulation may, in his or her discretion and upon reasonable grounds, cancel a certificate of self insurance.

A certificate of self-insurance issued under § 31-33-9 or this section cannot be used to satisfy requirements of § 31-34-1 as the General Assembly intended all owners of rental vehicles to adhere specifically to the requirements of chapter 34 of title 31 and that the possession of self-insurance certificate issued pursuant to a separate statutory provision does not meet the requirements of §§ 31-34-1 and 31-34-2.

      Any order of suspension or impoundment issued under this chapter may be terminated at any time if the administrator of the division of motor vehicles determines upon a showing of proof of financial security that the operator or owner of the motor vehicle was in compliance with financial security requirements of this chapter at the time of the traffic offense or accident which resulted in the order against the person. That determination may be made without a hearing. This section does not apply unless the person shows good cause for the person’s failure to present satisfactory proof of financial responsibility to the court, traffic tribunal, or administrator of the division of motor vehicles prior to the issuance of the order.

       For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter, every police officer of a state, town, or municipality is deemed an agent of the administrator of the division of motor vehicles. Any police officer who, in the performance of his or her duties as authorized by law, becomes aware of a person whose license is under an order of suspension, or whose certificate of registration and registration plates are under an order of impoundment, pursuant to this section may confiscate the license, certificate of registration, and registration plates, and return them to the administrator of the division of motor vehicles. Any forms used by law enforcement agencies in administering this section shall be prescribed by the administrator of the division of motor vehicles, the cost of which shall be borne by these agencies. No police officer, law enforcement agency employing a police officer, or political subdivision or governmental agency that employs a police officer shall be liable in a civil action for damages or loss to persons arising out of the performance of the duty required or authorized by this section. “Police officer” means the full-time police from the rank of patrol up to and including the rank of colonel or chief of any police department in any city or town within the state of Rhode Island or of the state police.

       All fees, except court costs, collected under this chapter shall be paid into the state treasury and credited to the highway safety fund in a special account hereby created, to be known as the “financial responsibility compliance special account.” This special account shall be used exclusively to cover costs incurred by the division of motor vehicles in the administration of this chapter, and by any law enforcement agency employing any police officer who returns any license, certificate of registration, and registration plates to the administrator of the division of motor vehicles pursuant to this chapter.

       The administrator of the division of motor vehicles, court, or traffic tribunal may require proof of financial security.

       <ol>
        <li id="t31c47s31-47-12ol1c1">

       At the time of investigation of a motor vehicle offense or accident by a police officer or when a motor vehicle is stopped by a police officer for probable cause, the police officer making the investigation or stopping the motor vehicle shall ask for evidence of proof of financial security as defined in this chapter. Proof of financial responsibility may be provided using a mobile electronic device; provided, however, that the police officer requiring the proof of financial responsibility shall be prohibited from viewing any other content on the mobile electronic device. Any person utilizing an electronic device to provide proof of insurance shall assume any and all liability for any damage sustained to the mobile electronic device. If the evidence is not provided, a citation to appear before the traffic tribunal shall be issued to the operator. However, any citation issued solely for failing to provide evidence of financial responsibility shall be held by the issuing police officer or law enforcement agency for at least one business day before submitting the citation to the traffic tribunal. Any operator who receives a citation for failing to provide valid evidence of financial responsibility shall have the opportunity to provide evidence of financial responsibility that existed at the time of the violation within the one-business-day period, at which time the issuing police officer or law enforcement agency shall withdraw the citation, and the motorist shall not be required to appear before the traffic tribunal. Notwithstanding this provision, police officers who issue a citation for lack of evidence of financial responsibility, in addition to one or more other citations, need not wait the one-business-day waiting period before submitting the citation for lack of evidence of financial responsibility to the traffic tribunal. The traffic tribunal may, by rule and regulation, prescribe the procedures for processing the citations. Motor vehicles may not be stopped solely for the purpose of checking for evidence of proof of financial security.

       Diesel emissions, due in large part to their high concentrations of particulate matter, are associated with severe and multiple health risks to the citizens of Rhode Island, including increased risks of cancer, decreased lung function, aggravated asthma, heart attacks and premature death. Reducing diesel pollution will also help advance the state’s climate protection goals and climate action plan by reducing black carbon pollution.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c47.3s31-47.3-1ol1b">
       Diesel exhaust also contains nitrogen oxides, which contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone, or smog. Rhode Island continues to be classified as a “serious-nonattainment area” for ozone.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c47.3s31-47.3-1ol1c">
       Reducing diesel pollution may help to stem the tide of the asthma epidemic in Rhode Island where more than one in ten (10) citizens have asthma. Rhode Island ranks eighth (8th) in the U.S. for the worst asthma rates overall, and has the fifth (5th) highest rate for children. Rhode Islanders pay about forty-one million dollars ($41,000,000) per year in asthma-associated health costs. Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children and responsible for the most school absences in Rhode Island.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c47.3s31-47.3-1ol1d">
       The EPA, recognizing the harmful effects of diesel emissions, issued new fuel and engine emission standards that will reduce particulate matter emissions from engines model year 2007 and newer ninety percent (90%) below previous levels.
      </li>
      <li id="t31c47.3s31-47.3-1ol1e">
       The same technology that reduces emissions by up to ninety percent (90%) for new engines can be retrofitted onto existing engines, which will continue to operate for years.

     <p>
      Airbag system fraud is a public safety concern for consumers and the automobile insurance system. Efforts to combat this problem, one that could place innocent consumers at-risk of serious bodily injuries, have been piecemeal. This chapter is intended to address the issue in a coordinated way. It is through this collective effort that consumers will be protected and the integrity of the restraint system assured.
