      <li id="t39c01s39-1-1ol1a">
       The general assembly finds and therefore declares that:
       <ol>
        <li id="t39c01s39-1-1ol1a1">
         The businesses of distributing electrical energy, producing and transporting manufactured and natural gas, operating water works and furnishing supplies of water for domestic, industrial, and commercial use, offering to the public transportation of persons and property, furnishing and servicing telephonic and wireless audio and visual communication systems, and operation of community antenna television systems are affected with a public interest;
        </li>
        <li id="t39c01s39-1-1ol1a2">
         Supervision and reasonable regulation by the state of the manner in which the businesses construct their systems and carry on their operations within the state are necessary to protect and promote the convenience, health, comfort, safety, accommodation, and welfare of the people, and are a proper exercise of the police power of the state; and
        </li>
        <li id="t39c01s39-1-1ol1a3">
         Preservation of the state’s resources, commerce, and industry requires the assurance of adequate public transportation and communication facilities, water supplies, and an abundance of energy, all supplied to the people with reliability, at economical cost, and with due regard for the preservation and enhancement of the environment, the conservation of natural resources, including scenic, historic, and recreational assets, and the strengthening of long-range, land-use planning.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t39c01s39-1-1ol1b">
       It is hereby declared to be the policy of the state to provide fair regulation of public utilities and carriers in the interest of the public, to promote availability of adequate, efficient, and economical energy, communication, and transportation services and water supplies to the inhabitants of the state, to provide just and reasonable rates and charges for such services and supplies, without unjust discrimination, undue preferences or advantages, or unfair or destructive competitive practices, and to cooperate with other states and agencies of the federal government in promoting and coordinating efforts to achieve realization of this policy.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c01s39-1-1ol1c">
       To this end, there is hereby vested in the public utilities commission and the division of public utilities and carriers the exclusive power and authority to supervise, regulate, and make orders governing the conduct of companies offering to the public in intrastate commerce energy, communication, and transportation services and water supplies for the purpose of increasing and maintaining the efficiency of the companies, according desirable safeguards and convenience to their employees and to the public, and protecting them and the public against improper and unreasonable rates, tolls, and charges by providing full, fair, and adequate administrative procedures and remedies, and by securing a judicial review to any party aggrieved by such an administrative proceeding or ruling.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c01s39-1-1ol1d">
       The legislature also finds and declares, as of 1996, the following:
       <ol>
        <li id="t39c01s39-1-1ol1d1">
         That lower retail electricity rates would promote the state’s economy and the health and general welfare of the citizens of Rhode Island;
        </li>
        <li id="t39c01s39-1-1ol1d2">
         That current research and experience indicates that greater competition in the electricity industry would result in a decrease in electricity rates over time;
        </li>
        <li id="t39c01s39-1-1ol1d3">
         That greater competition in the electricity industry would stimulate economic growth;
        </li>
        <li id="t39c01s39-1-1ol1d4">
         That it is in the public interest to promote competition in the electricity industry and to establish performance-based ratemaking for regulated utilities;
        </li>
        <li id="t39c01s39-1-1ol1d5">
         That in connection with the transition to a more competitive electric utility industry, public utilities should have a reasonable opportunity to recover transitional costs associated with commitments prudently incurred in the past pursuant to their legal obligations to provide reliable electric service at reasonable costs;
        </li>
        <li id="t39c01s39-1-1ol1d6">
         That it shall be the policy of the state to encourage, through all feasible means and measures, states where fossil-fueled, electric-generating units producing air emissions affecting Rhode Island air quality are located to reduce such emissions over time to levels that enable cost-effective attainment of environmental standards within Rhode Island; and
        </li>
        <li id="t39c01s39-1-1ol1d7">
         That in a restructured electrical industry the same protections currently afforded to low-income customers shall continue.

       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t39c01s39-1-1ol1e">
       The legislature further finds and declares as of 2006:
       <ol>
        <li id="t39c01s39-1-1ol1e1">
         That prices of energy, including especially fossil-fuels and electricity, are rising faster than the cost of living and are subject to sharp fluctuations, which conditions create hardships for many households, institutions, organizations, and businesses in the state;
        </li>
        <li id="t39c01s39-1-1ol1e2">
         That while utility restructuring has brought some benefits, notably in transmission and distribution costs and more efficient use of generating capacities, it has not resulted in competitive markets for residential and small commercial-industrial customers, lower overall prices, or greater diversification of energy resources used for electrical generation;
        </li>
        <li id="t39c01s39-1-1ol1e3">
         That the state’s economy and the health and general welfare of the people of Rhode Island benefit when energy supplies are reliable and least-cost; and
        </li>
        <li id="t39c01s39-1-1ol1e4">
         That it is a necessary move beyond basic utility restructuring in order to secure for Rhode Island, to the maximum extent reasonably feasible, the benefits of reasonable and stable rates, least-cost procurement, and system reliability that includes energy resource diversification, distributed generation, and load management.

        In examining this title as a whole, it is evident that the Legislature has expressed its intent to cover the field of public-utilities regulation and has declared that the public utilities commission has exclusive power to regulate public utilities. Accordingly, a municipal ordinance regulating the construction of power lines was pre-empted by state law because it invaded a field that the state has intentionally occupied. East Greenwich v. O'Neil,

        R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-1-1 limited the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission’s (PUC’s) authority to regulating conduct of companies offering intrastate services to the public, and because voice messaging service (VMS) was an intrastate and an interstate service that could not be separated into intrastate and interstate services, the PUC exceeded its authority under § 39-1-1(c) by ordering a telephone company to provide VMS to its competitors at a discounted rate.

        Public Utility Commission’s (PUC) decision to deny a county water authority’s (CWA) requested rate increase of 35 percent by limiting the funding of the CWA’s infrastructure replacement program did not conflict with the Comprehensive Clean Water Infrastructure Act of 1993 (CCWIA), R.I. Gen. Laws § 46-15.6-6, because the PUC’s statutory authority in R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-1-1(c) could be read harmoniously with the CCWIA as consistent with the legislature’s design that the PUC review rate cases and protect the public from unreasonable rates, tolls, and charges.

        Although charged with consideration of consumer interests in fixing rates, the public utilities commission must not base its rulings on consumer ability to pay for services rendered, as consumer interests are adequately protected if the commission permits the utility to earn a return no greater than is necessary to maintain its financial health.

        Court declined to abstain from considering whether the Pipefitters Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-27-1 et seq., was preempted by federal law because the language of R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 39-1-1(c), 28-27-29 were not ambiguous, and abstention would impose a considerable and unnecessary delay on the parties. There was also no ongoing administrative proceeding warranting Younger abstention, as the state admitted that it had no intention of enforcing the notices of violations it sent to the gas company concerning the failure of its employees to obtain pipefitter licenses.

      When the term of office of a commissioner shall expire, and he or she has participated in hearing all or a substantial part of the evidence in a proceeding pending before the commission, he or she shall remain a commissioner for the sole purpose of completing the hearing and deciding the pending matter and signing the findings, orders, and judgments therein. For such services, the commissioner shall be paid reasonable compensation and necessary expenses as fixed by the commission as composed following the expiration of his or her term of office. For this purpose, a proceeding shall be deemed completed when the commission enters its final order therein regardless of whether the order is or may be appealed to the supreme court and the case remanded to the commission for further proceedings.

      Prior to the commencement of any formal hearing, the commission may, in its discretion, direct the parties or their attorneys to appear before it for a conference. At or before the conference, the commission may order any party to file a number of copies, as it may specify, of all exhibits it intends to use in the hearing, and the names and addresses of witnesses it intends to produce in its direct case, together with a short statement of the purposes of each exhibit and of the testimony of each witness. After entry of an order, a party shall not be permitted, except in the discretion of the commission, to introduce into evidence, in its direct case, exhibits that are not filed in accordance with the order. At the conference, the commission may designate a date before which it requires any party in interest to specify what items shown by the filed exhibits are conceded, and further proof of conceded items shall not be required. The commission may also require the parties to simplify the issues; to consider admissions of fact and of documents that will avoid unnecessary proof; and to limit the number of expert witnesses. The commission shall enter an order reciting the concessions and agreements made by the parties, and unless modified at the hearing to prevent manifest injustice, the hearing shall be controlled by the order.

If any person fails to obey the command of the subpoena, without reasonable cause, or if a person in attendance before the commission shall, without reasonable cause, refuse to be sworn, or to be examined, or to answer a legal and pertinent question, any commissioner may apply to any justice of the superior court, upon proof by affidavit of the fact, for a rule or order returnable in not less than two (2) nor more than five (5) days, directing the person to show cause why he or she should not be adjudged in contempt. Upon the return of the order, the justice before whom the matter is brought for a hearing shall examine under oath the person, and the person shall be given an opportunity to be heard, and if the justice shall determine that the person has refused without reasonable cause or legal excuse to be examined, or to answer a legal and pertinent question, or to produce books, accounts, papers, records, and documents material to the issue that he or she was ordered to bring or produce, he or she may forthwith commit the person to the adult correctional institutions, there to remain until he or she submits to do the act that he or she was so required to do, or is discharged according to law.

      For effective administration, supervision, and regulation of public utilities, communications carriers, and common or contract carriers, the administrator, at his or her discretion, may designate examiners, investigators, hearing officers, or one or more agents of the division to make investigations and conduct hearings. In conducting investigations and hearings, the administrator and every person designated therefor by him or her shall be vested with all the powers conferred on the chairperson of the commission by § 39-1-13. Upon completion of his or her investigation and hearing, the person hearing or investigating shall file his or her recommended decision and findings in writing with the administrator; and the decision and findings, when approved by the administrator, shall have the same force and effect as a decision and findings by the administrator. The administrator may, however, at his or her discretion, upon considering the evidence in the matter at issue and the written recommended decision as filed by the hearing officer, agent, examiner, or investigator, decide the matter in hearing or under investigation him or herself, and in such case, the decision of the administrator with his or her findings shall become effective when signed and filed by him or her.

The expenses anticipated by the attorney general and the commission for each upcoming fiscal year shall be communicated to the administrator within thirty (30) days of request by the administrator. The administrator shall thereupon apportion and assess one hundred percent (100%) of such expenses among the several public utility companies and common carriers located in this state in the proportion that the gross intrastate-utility-operating revenues of each public utility company and common carrier shall bear to the total, gross intrastate-utility-operating revenues for the last preceding fiscal year of all public utility companies and common carriers; provided, however, that any public utility or common carrier, whose gross intrastate revenues in any fiscal year as reported to the administrator do not exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), shall not be subject to the assessment under the provisions hereof; and, provided further, that all motor carriers subject to the provisions of chapters 12 and 14 of this title shall not be subject to the assessment under the provisions hereof.

       There is hereby created a fund to be known as the public utilities reserve account, an account within the public utilities commission in the general fund. Such account, hereinafter referred to as the “fund,” shall be used for the purpose of providing the financial means for the commission and division to purchase materials, and to employ on a contract or other basis, legal counsel, official stenographers, engineers, accountants, economists, and other expert witnesses, and for other necessary expenses of the commission and division in investigations and hearings related to applications and filings made by public utilities, or commission- or division-initiated investigations into utility operating practices, or related appeals to state or federal courts or in relevant regulatory matters before federal agencies. The general assembly shall annually appropriate to the fund a sum equal to twenty-five one thousandths of one percent (.00025%) of the gross, annual operating revenues of gas, electric, and telephone companies attributable to their conduct of intrastate operations in this state during the year next preceding; provided, however, that if at June 30, in any year the balance in the fund shall be in excess of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), the amount of the excess shall forthwith be transferred to the general fund of the state. Prebilled revenue shall be excluded from an excess balance to be transferred to the general fund. The state controller is authorized and directed to draw his or her orders upon the general treasurer for the payment from the fund of such sums as may be required from time to time upon receipt by him or her of proper vouchers approved by the administrator.

The administrator or the commission chairperson, as appropriate, shall ascertain the expenses and shall determine the amount to be paid by the public utility company or companies, and bills shall be rendered therefor either at the conclusion of the investigation or hearing, or from time to time during its progress, and the amount of each bill so rendered shall be paid by the public utility to the administrator or the commission, as appropriate, within thirty (30) days from the date of its rendition unless, within the thirty-day (30) time period, the public utility so billed shall request an opportunity to be heard by the commission as to the amount thereof. The commission shall comply with any such request. Any amount of the bill not paid within thirty (30) days from the date of service of the determination upon the hearing, or, if none shall be requested, within thirty (30) days from the date of rendition of the bill, shall draw interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum. At the discretion of the administrator, or the commission chairperson, as appropriate, utility companies may be prebilled for contractual services utilized by the commission or division. Any revenue received from public utilities not expended upon the completion of the case will be promptly reimbursed to the utility company. The total amount that may be charged to any public utility under authority of this section for proceedings before the commission or division or in related appeals before state or federal courts in any calendar year shall not exceed seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($750,000), provided that any indirect cost recovery obligations pursuant to §

       Electric distribution companies required to file restructuring plans.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t39c01s39-1-27ol1a">
       Each electric distribution company shall file with the commission a plan for transferring ownership of generation facilities into a separate affiliate of the electric distribution company. The transmission facilities owned by the electric distribution company also may be transferred to an affiliated electric transmission company at a price that shall equal the book value of the transmission facilities on the electric distribution company’s accounts net of depreciation and deferred taxes as the date of transfer, but such a transfer is not required. The generation plant, equipment, and facilities owned by an electric distribution company shall be transferred to an affiliate that is a nonregulated power producer at a price that shall equal the book value of the generation plant, equipment, and facilities on the electric distribution company’s accounts net of depreciation and deferred taxes as of the date of the transfer. Consistent with the schedule for implementing retail access in § 39-1-27.3, each electric transmission company shall file tariffs with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and electric-distribution companies shall file tariffs with the commission. The tariffs will provide the terms, conditions, and rates for nondiscriminatory access to transmission and distribution facilities to wholesale and retail customers and to nonregulated power producers. The tariffs shall: (1) Conform to the standards, policies, and requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the commission as appropriate with respect to nondiscriminatory access to transmission and distribution services; (2) Fulfill such standards with respect to both transmission and distribution services for the benefit of both wholesale and retail customers and their suppliers; and (3) Provide retail access in accordance with the schedule set forth in § 39-1-27.3. For purposes of this section, “nondiscriminatory access” means access to transmission and distribution services on rates, terms, and conditions found to be reasonable by the FERC or the commission as appropriate and applied consistently to all customers in a rate class regardless of their supplier. When establishing terms and conditions for distribution service, the commission shall implement standards, policies, and requirements consistent with those established by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for transmission service unless it determines that alternative terms and conditions are in the public interest.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c01s39-1-27ol1b">
       The commission shall review the plan within six (6) months of filing and if the plan is in compliance with chapter 3 of this title, shall authorize the property transfers, securities issuances, and affiliate transactions pursuant to this title and shall grant all necessary regulatory approvals. All existing state and local rights, authorizations, and approvals, including but not limited to, permits, licenses, locations, indentures, leases, orders, or similar rights associated with the ownership and operation of plant and equipment, shall be deemed transferred with the associated plant and equipment upon the commission’s authorization of the transfer effective as of the date of transfer. Notwithstanding any provisions of this section, if the electric distribution company’s wholesale power supplier chooses to transfer its generation assets to a nonaffiliate of the electric distribution company for purposes of carrying out the market valuation required by § 39-1-27.4(g), and such transfer to a nonaffiliate is specified in the electric distribution company’s restructuring plan filed with the commission pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the transfer of the electric distribution company’s interest in the generation facilities may be made directly to the nonaffiliate. In the case of such a transfer directly to a nonaffiliate, all of the state and local rights, authorizations, and approvals, including those enumerated above, shall be deemed transferred with the associated plant and equipment upon the commission’s authorization of the transfer effective as of the date of the transfer.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c01s39-1-27ol1c">
       The electric distribution company shall implement the corporate reorganizations and property transfers specified in such restructuring plan; terminate its all-requirements contract with its wholesale power supplier on the terms set forth in § 39-1-27.4; and provide retail access for all customers in Rhode Island with a standard offer, as set forth in § 39-1-27.3, no later than three (3) months after retail access is available to forty percent (40%) or more of the kilowatt-hour sales in New England. The commission may extend this time if it determines that additional time is necessary to implement the transactions on reasonable terms and in accordance with a reasonable schedule; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the effect of § 39-1-27.3 or permit the commission to unduly discriminate in providing retail access among or within rate classes.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c01s39-1-27ol1d">
       Following the complete implementation of the restructuring plans, electric distribution companies shall be prohibited from selling electricity at retail and from owning, operating, or controlling generating facilities, although such facilities may be owned by affiliates of electric distribution companies. For purposes of this subsection, providing the standard-offer service and last-resort power supply in accordance with subsections (d) and (f) of § 39-1-27.3 shall not be construed as selling electricity at retail.

      <li id="t39c01s39-1-27ol1e">
       Following the termination of the electric distribution company’s contracts with its wholesale power supplier, the wholesale power supplier shall become a nonregulated power producer, and shall be free, subject to the requirements of the standard offer set forth in § 39-1-27.3(e) and retail electric licensing commission plan requirements pursuant to § 39-1-27.1, to sell electricity generated from each of its facilities on either the wholesale or retail markets at market prices, either directly or through an affiliate, which shall also become a nonregulated power producer. The former wholesale power supplier and its affiliates shall be free to apply to become exempt wholesale generators pursuant to § 32 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935,

        15 U.S.C.
       </cite>
       § 79z-5a [repealed], and other federal law, rules, and regulations, and each and every generating facility of the former wholesale power supplier shall become an eligible facility pursuant to that statute. Accordingly, the legislature hereby finds and declares that the division has sufficient regulatory authority, resources, access to books and records to exercise its duties; and that the full participation of former wholesale power suppliers and affiliated nonregulated power producers in the market and the designation of each of the former wholesale power supplier’s facilities as eligible facilities will benefit consumers; is consistent with state law; will not provide any unfair competitive advantage by virtue of their status as a former wholesale power supplier or as affiliates of electric distribution companies; and is in the public interest.

       Although reducing air emissions from power plants is a goal of electricity industry restructuring, power plants in Rhode Island already have low emissions relative to their counterparts in other states. For this reason, it is unnecessary for the restructuring plans required by this section to address in-state air emission reductions. However, to the extent a wholesale power supplier receiving contract termination fees pursuant to § 39-1-27.4(b)(4) owns and operates as of December 31, 1995, fossil-fired generation in another state that does not meet air emission standards applicable as of that date to new electric-generating facilities in that state, the wholesale power suppliers shall cooperate with the appropriate environmental officials in the state or states where the generating facilities are located to develop a plan for reducing the emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter from the plants on an overall basis through retirements, replacements, controls, or offsets, or any combination of the above, toward the air emissions standards applicable to new electric-generating facilities in effect in the state or states where the plants are located as of January 1, 1996. The plans shall be implemented in connection with electric-industry restructuring in the state or states where the generating facilities are located.

       An electric distribution company, whether public, quasi-municipal, or investor owned, that as of January 1, 1996, did not purchase power at wholesale from a wholesale power supplier under an all-requirements contract, shall include proposals for recovering transition costs consistent with the elements that would be comparable in nature to the elements included in termination fees pursuant to § 39-1-27.4(b) through (g) and for providing a standard offer consistent with requirements of § 39-1-27.3(d) in its plan filed with the commission pursuant to this section. The filing by an electric distribution company that is a quasi-municipal corporation shall also address any unique circumstances affecting the electric distribution company, including special contract requirements or charter restrictions and the conditions that the quasi-municipal corporation must satisfy in order to participate in retail competition. In reviewing the filing and determining the appropriate level of transition cost recovery, the commission shall apply standards consistent with those contained in § 39-1-27.4(b) through (g) and with this subsection. The commission shall be authorized to take any action or to grant any approval necessary to maintain hydroelectric power purchases from the Niagara and St. Lawrence power projects by quasi-municipal corporations. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, quasi-municipal electric distribution companies that purchase hydroelectric power from the Niagara and St. Lawrence power projects shall be authorized to continue to resell that power to residential customers within their service territories. After notice and public hearing, the commission may exempt electric distribution companies subject to this subsection from: (1) The requirement to transfer ownership of generation and transmission facilities to affiliated companies pursuant to subsection (a) of this section; and (2) The prohibition against selling electricity at retail pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with respect to sales within the service territory of the electric distribution company, if it determines that the exemptions are in the public interest.

       With the exception of the requirements of the standard offer set forth in § 39-1-27.3(e) and (f) and retail electric licensing commission plan requirements pursuant to § 39-1-27.1, nothing in this section shall be construed or interpreted to constrain the application of antitrust laws to nonregulated power producers, whether affiliated or not with an electric distribution company.

       Electric distribution companies required to provide retail access, standard offer and last-resort service.

      <li id="t39c01s39-1-27.3ol1a">
       To promote economic development and the creation and preservation of employment opportunities within the state, each electric distribution company, except Pascoag Utility District, a quasi-municipal corporation, district, and subdivision of the state (“electric distribution company”), shall offer retail access from nonregulated power producers to all customers.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c01s39-1-27.3ol1b">
       Through year 2009, and effective July 1, 2007, through year 2020, each electric distribution company shall arrange for a standard power-supply offer (“standard offer”) to customers that have not elected to enter into power-supply arrangements with other nonregulated power suppliers. The rates that are charged by the electric distribution company to customers for standard-offer service shall be approved by the commission and shall be designed to recover the electric distribution company’s costs and no more than the electric distribution company’s costs; provided, that the commission may establish and/or implement a rate that averages the costs over periods of time. The electric distribution company shall not be entitled to recover any profit margin on the sale of standard-offer power, except with approval of the commission as may be necessary to implement, fairly and effectively, system reliability and least-cost procurement. The electric distribution company will be entitled to recover its costs incurred from providing the standard offer arising out of: (1) Wholesale standard-offer supply agreements with power suppliers in effect prior to January 1, 2002; (2) Power-supply arrangements that are approved by the commission after January 1, 2002; (3) Power-supply arrangements made pursuant to §§ 39-1-27.3.1 and 39-1-27.8; and (4) Any other power-supply-related arrangements prudently made after January 1, 2002, to provide standard-offer supply or to mitigate standard-offer supply costs, including costs for system reliability, procurement, and least-cost procurement, as provided for in § 39-1-27.7. Subject to commission approval, the electric distribution company may enter into financial contracts designed to hedge fuel-related or other variable costs associated with power-supply arrangements and the costs of any such financial contracts shall be recoverable in standard-offer rates. The electric distribution company’s standard-offer revenues and its standard-offer costs shall be accounted for and reconciled with interest at least annually. Except as otherwise may be directed by the commission in order to accomplish purposes established by law, any over recoveries shall be refunded to customers in a manner directed by the commission, and any under recoveries shall be recovered by the electric distribution company through a uniform adjustment factor approved by the commission. The commission shall have the discretion to apply such adjustment factor in any given instance to all customers or to such specific class of customers that the commission deems equitable under the circumstances provided that the distribution company recovers any under recovery in its entirety. Once a customer has elected to enter into a power-supply arrangement with a nonregulated power producer, the electric distribution company shall not be required to arrange for the standard offer to such customer except as provided in § 39-1-27.3.1. No customer who initially elects the standard offer and then chooses an alternative supplier shall be required to pay any withdrawal fee or penalty to the provider of the standard offer unless such a penalty or withdrawal fee was agreed to as part of a contract; however, no residential customer shall be required to pay a penalty or withdrawal fee for choosing an alternative supplier. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to restrict the right of any nonregulated power producer to offer to sell power to customers at a price comparable to that of the standard offer specified pursuant to this subsection. The electric distribution company may not terminate an existing standard-offer wholesale supply agreement without the written consent of the division.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c01s39-1-27.3ol1c">
       In recognition that electricity is an essential service, each electric distribution company shall arrange for a last-resort power supply for customers who have left the standard offer for any reason and are not otherwise receiving electric service from nonregulated power producers. The electric distribution company shall procure last-resort service supply from wholesale power suppliers. Prior to acquiring last-resort supply, the electric distribution company will file with the commission a supply acquisition plan or plans that include the acquisition procedure, the pricing options being sought, and a proposed term of service for which last-resort service will be acquired. The term of service may be short- or long-term and acquisitions may occur from time to time and for more than one supplier for segments of last-resort service load over different terms, if appropriate. All the components of the acquisition plans, however, shall be subject to commission review and approval. Once an acquisition plan is approved by the commission, the electric distribution company shall be authorized to acquire last-resort service supply consistent with the approved acquisition plan and recover its costs incurred from providing last-resort service pursuant to the approved acquisition plan. The commission may periodically review the acquisition plan to determine whether it should be prospectively modified due to changed market conditions. The commission shall have the authority and discretion to approve special tariff conditions and rates proposed by the electric distribution company that the commission finds are in the public interest, including without limitation: (1) Short- or long-term optional service at different rates; (2) Term commitments or notice provisions before individual customers leave last-resort service; (3) Last-resort service rates for residential or any other special class of customers that are different than the rates for other last-resort customers; and/or (4) Last-resort service rates that are designed to encourage any class of customers to return to the market. The electric distribution company’s last-resort service revenues and its last-resort service costs shall be accounted for and reconciled with interest at least annually. Any over recoveries shall be refunded and any under recoveries shall be recovered by the electric distribution company through a uniform adjustment factor approved by the commission. The commission shall have the discretion to apply such adjustment factor in any given instance to all customers or to such specific class of customers that the commission deems equitable under the circumstances provided that the distribution company recovers any under recovery in its entirety. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit an electric distribution company from terminating service provided hereunder in accordance with commission rules and regulations in the event of nonpayment of this service. The commission may promulgate regulations to implement this section including the terms and conditions upon which last-resort service is offered and provided to customers.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c01s39-1-27.3ol1d">
       If a customer being served by a nonregulated power producer pays any taxes assessed for electric service to the electric distribution company and the electric distribution company forwards such tax payment for the power portion of the bill to a nonregulated power producer for payment by the nonregulated power producer to the state, neither the customer nor the electric distribution company shall be liable for such taxes forwarded if the nonregulated power producer fails to remit such taxes to the state for any reason.

       The commission may, notwithstanding the provisions of § 39-1-27.3, allow customers no longer eligible for standard-offer service to return to standard-offer service, subject to the process set forth in this section. The process shall be as follows: The commission shall hold hearings to determine whether there is a sufficient presence of nonregulated power producers offering reasonably priced power-supply service to customers in Rhode Island. If the commission determines that these market conditions are not present, the commission shall direct the electric distribution company to prepare and file a plan that creates an option for customers to return to the standard offer, including terms and conditions for customers returning and the manner in which the power supply will be procured. This plan may include term commitments or notice provisions before nonresidential customers are permitted to leave standard-offer service once they return. The commission shall conduct a hearing to review the electric distribution company’s plan and issue an order approving the plan, including any modifications the commission deems appropriate.

      <li id="t39c01s39-1-27.3.1ol1b">
       Once the plan is approved by the commission, the electric distribution company and the division shall jointly prepare a request for power-supply proposals (“RFP”) consistent with the commission’s order, develop reasonable bidder qualifications, issue the RFP, review the bids, and jointly select a winning bidder or bidders to supply power. If the electric distribution company and the division mutually agree that the bids are unreasonably high, they shall have the discretion to reject all bids and re-issue an RFP at a later date that they deem appropriate. If the electric distribution company and the division cannot agree on any matter, the dispute shall be submitted to the commission for resolution. Once the winning bidder or bidders are selected, a supply contract or contracts on terms reasonably acceptable to the distribution company and the division will be executed by the electric distribution company and no further regulatory approval shall be required.

The standard-offer rates for the nonresidential customers returning to the standard offer shall be determined by the commission after the commission reviews the costs of the power supply resulting from the bid process. The rate for nonresidential customers returning to the standard offer may differ from those of other customers, if the commission deems the rate differential to be appropriate.

To the extent that bids received or terms negotiated would, on an expected value basis, lower the transition charges paid by ultimate customers in Rhode Island, the wholesaler power supplier shall use all reasonable means to consummate the sale, buydown, or assignment and upon completion shall promptly file appropriate adjustments to the contract termination fees in place at that time. To provide an incentive for wholesale power suppliers to obtain the best possible terms for any sale, buydown, or assignment, they shall be allowed to retain ten percent (10%) of the savings expected to be realized by customers as a result of the sale, buydown, or assignment.

The wholesale power supplier shall select the valuation methodology utilized which may be for all the generating facilities as a group, groups of generating facilities, or individual generating facilities. The wholesale power supplier shall meet its obligations under this section by leasing, selling, spinning off, or otherwise disposing of at least a fifteen percent (15%) interest in its electrical-generating facilities, other than nuclear units or entitlements; provided, however, if, pursuant to a requirement in connection with electric industry restructuring in another state prior to completion of the valuation pursuant to this subsection, a wholesale power supplier subject to this subsection is required to sell, spin-off, or otherwise dispose of more than a fifteen percent (15%) ownership interest in its electric-generating facilities, other than nuclear units or entitlements, then the same requirement, including related timing requirements, shall apply in the state and the market valuation resulting from fulfilling that requirement shall be used in determining the adjustment to the contract termination fee required by this subsection. Once the wholesale power supplier determines the percentage interest in its electrical-generating facilities that it will lease, sell, spin-off, or otherwise submit to market valuation to meet its obligation under this subsection, the company shall develop an implementation methodology to accomplish the lease, sale, spin-off, or other disposition of interest that is reasonably likely to approximate the market value of the generation assets. The implementation methodology shall be filed with the commission on or before July 1, 1997, for the commission to review and approve or reject no later than ninety (90) days after submittal. The commission shall approve the implementation methodology unless the commission finds, after public hearing, the methodology is not reasonably likely to approximate the market value of the company’s generating assets, taking into consideration the restrictions included in mortgage indentures and the need to satisfy the requirements of regulatory authorities outside the state. Promptly after commission approval of the implementation methodology, companies subject to this section must submit, for regulatory review, applications for the approvals necessary to commence such valuation. In addition, companies subject to this section shall also provide the commission with quarterly status reports on the progress of proceedings before other regulatory agencies associated with the implementation of this section. The valuation required by this section shall be completed within six (6) months after: (1) Retail access is available to forty percent (40%) or more of the kilowatt-hour sales in New England or (2) The receipt of all necessary regulatory approval for the valuation, whichever occurs later; provided, however, the commission may extend the deadline for completing the valuation by no more than six (6) months if it determines that an extension is in the public interest. Upon completion of the valuation, the wholesale power supplier, together with its affiliated electric distribution company shall file to adjust the contract termination fees in place at the time the valuation is complete as necessary to reflect the electric distribution company’s share of the market valuation in the transition charge paid by ultimate customers in Rhode Island. Any adjustment shall be net of the estimated revenue lost by the wholesale power supplier as a result of retail access during the period prior to completion of such valuation, the electric distribution company’s share of prudently incurred capital investments made after December 31, 1995, which were reasonably necessary to (i) Enable the electrical-generating facilities to operate safely and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, (ii) Improve environmental performance or to increase fuel diversity or flexibility, with regulatory authorization, reasonable transaction costs, (including the cost of refinancing), and revenue lost as a result of the reduced return on equity specified in subsection (d). For purposes of this section, the unreduced return on equity that will be used prospectively and to value the revenue lost prior to the adjustment shall be the return on equity allowed to the wholesale power supplier’s affiliated electric distribution company as of December 31, 1995, and shall be included in the wholesale power supplier’s overall capital structure following the valuation. Any adjustment to the contract termination fee pursuant to this subsection shall be reflected in the termination fee otherwise calculated in accordance with subsection (b) as a uniform adjustment spread equally over the period beginning with the date the adjustment is made and ending December 31, 2009.

     <p>
      Each electric distribution company shall submit a proposed supply procurement plan or plans to the commission not later than March 1, 2009, and each March 1 thereafter through March 1, 2018. The supply procurement plan or plans shall be consistent with the purposes of least-cost procurement and shall, as appropriate, take into account plans and orders with regard to system reliability and energy efficiency and conservation procurement. The supply procurement plan or plans will include the acquisition procedure, the pricing options being sought, and a proposed term of service for which standard-offer service will be acquired. The term of service may be of various, staggered term lengths and acquisitions may occur from time to time and for more than one supplier for segments of standard-offer load over different terms, if appropriate. There also may be separate procurement plans for residential and nonresidential classes or separate plans among nonresidential classes. All the components of the procurement plans shall be subject to commission review and approval. Once a procurement plan is approved by the commission, the electric distribution company shall be authorized to acquire standard-offer service supply consistent with the approved procurement plan and recover its costs incurred from providing standard-offer service pursuant to the approved procurement plan. The commission may periodically review the procurement plan to determine whether it should be prospectively modified due to changed market conditions. The commission shall have the authority and discretion to establish eligibility criteria by rate class, and approve special tariff conditions and rates proposed by the electric distribution company that the commission finds are in the public interest, including, without limitation: (1) Short- and long-term optional service at different rates; (2) Term commitments or notice provisions before individual customers leave standard-offer service; (3) Standard-offer service rates for residential or any other special class of customers that are different than the rates for other standard-offer customers; (4) Time of use commodity pricing for specified classes of customers, except residential customers; provided, however, that the commission may establish pilot programs for time of use commodity pricing for residential customers; and/or (5) Standard-offer service rates that are designed to encourage any class of customers to purchase supply directly from the market.

       <p>
        In examining this title as a whole, it is evident that the legislature has expressed its intent to cover the field of public-utilities regulation and has declared that the public utilities commission has exclusive power to regulate public utilities. Accordingly, a municipal ordinance regulating the construction of power lines was pre-empted by state law because it invaded a field that the state has intentionally occupied. East Greenwich v. O'Neil,
        <cite class="ocri">
         617 A.2d 104
        </cite>

        (R.I. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section empowers the commission not only to review municipal actions that are administrative in nature or are zoning board decisions but also to review a municipal ordinance regulating the construction of power lines. The word “ordinance” in this section was meant to include the town council’s ordinance. East Greenwich v. O'Neil,

        The commission’s “additional, implied and incidental power” is broad enough to authorize the commission to require utilities to present acceptable books of account to support their requests for rate relief and to set specific standards to be met before those books will be deemed acceptable.

        The power to make refunds and to set rates as set forth in chapter 3 of this title includes by implication the power to avoid windfalls to utilities and unjust enrichment by the application of an appropriate quantum of interest by way of compensation for the use of customers’ moneys pending determination of the amount of the refund to be made and the method of disbursement to be used.

        Though the public utilities administrator (now commission) has, subject to judicial review, broad power to fix rates which public utilities may charge for services, he may not grant temporary rate increases without finding an emergency as justification therefor. Gardiner v. Kennelly,

       Preamble.  For the past ten (10) years, the schools and libraries of Rhode Island have benefited from a regulatory agreement with Verizon and its predecessor companies that has provided up to two million dollars ($2,000,000) annually for support of telecommunications lines for internet access. In addition, the funds provided for in the original regulatory agreement and every dollar generated hereunder leverages a one dollar and twenty-seven cents ($1.27) federal E-Rate match. With the regulatory agreement approaching its termination and the advent of more advanced technologies, it is the intent of this section to provide a continued source of funding for internet access for eligible public and private schools and libraries.

        While the division of public utilities may permit discontinuance of railroad stops or discontinuance of certain train runs where there is little or no demand for service, it has no power to authorize a railroad operating under a charter granted by the general assembly to entirely discontinue passenger service over all of its lines when there is a substantial demand for such service and the furnishing of substantial service by the railroad or its affiliate is not assured.

        During the time periods established in this subsection, the commission may, in its discretion, after notice and public hearing, increase the sums for demand-side management and renewable resources. In addition, the commission shall, after notice and public hearing, determine the appropriate charge for these programs. The office of energy resources, and/or the administrator of the renewable energy programs, may seek to secure for the state an equitable and reasonable portion of renewable energy credits or certificates created by private projects funded through those programs. As used in this section, “renewable energy resources” shall mean: (1) Power generation technologies, as defined in § 39-26-5, “eligible renewable energy resources,” including off-grid and on-grid generating technologies located in Rhode Island, as a priority; (2) Research and development activities in Rhode Island pertaining to eligible renewable energy resources and to other renewable energy technologies for electrical generation; or (3) Projects and activities directly related to implementing eligible renewable energy resources projects in Rhode Island. Technologies for converting solar energy for space heating or generating domestic hot water may also be funded through the renewable energy programs.

      Whenever any highway bridge over which a street railway is operated shall become unsafe for public travel, the public utility operating the railway shall pay the whole expense of repairing, strengthening, or reconstructing the bridge, if the bridge would be safe for public travel if the railway were not operated over it; but, if a reconstruction of the bridge or the construction of a new bridge is required for any other cause, or if the bridge would be unsafe for public travel if the railway were not operated over it, then so much of the expense of repairing, strengthening, constructing, or reconstructing the bridge as may be equitable shall be paid by the public utility operating the railway. In the event of any disagreement between the public utility and the town or city bound by law to maintain the bridge, as to the necessity of any repair or reconstruction thereof, or as to the character of the repair or reconstruction, or as to the apportionment of the expense of the repair or reconstruction, the commission, upon application of any party in interest, and after due hearing, shall make such orders as it shall deem necessary, in the interest of public safety, for the repair, strengthening, or reconstruction of the bridge, and shall determine in accordance with the principle herein stated, the portion of the expense of the repair, strengthening, or reconstruction that shall be borne by the public utility.

The notice shall be in writing and shall be served upon the utility either personally or by certified mail at its principal office or place of business in the county where the work under the contract is to be performed, or, if there is no principal office or place of business in the county, at the nearest principal office or place of business of the utility, outside of the county.

The department, agency, division, or board, after examining and considering the utility’s basis for establishing a different schedule for the removal or relocation, shall, if its basis is reasonable, establish and notify the utility of a revised schedule for completing the removal or relocation.

If an action is commenced against a utility, as heretofore provided, the utility may interpose in its answer in the action any defense available under the provisions of the civil practice law and rules. The unreasonableness of the time schedule imposed by the state department, agency, division, or board shall be an absolute defense by the utility to any action by the contractor. If, in any action, the utility is found to owe nothing to the contractor, or if an offer of settlement is made by the utility that is not accepted by the contractor, and the resulting verdict against the utility is less than the offer of settlement, then in either event, the total cost of the utility of litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees, shall be paid to the utility by the contractor.

       As used in this section, “contact voltage” means and/or refers to a voltage resulting from abnormal power system conditions that may be present between two (2) conductive surfaces that can be simultaneously contacted by members of the general public and/or their animals. Contact voltage is caused by power system fault current as it flows through the impedance of available fault current pathways. Faults contributing to contact voltage may be due to electric system deterioration or damage or improper installation. Contact voltage is of greatest concern in areas where underground electric-distribution systems exist, as faults on those systems may remain active for long periods of time before detection and repair, and therefore contact voltage is a potential shock hazard.

The program shall require electric distribution companies to implement appropriate procedures to detect contact voltage on publicly accessible surfaces that could become energized by contact voltage due to faults in the underground distribution system. The program shall also recognize the potential for publicly accessible objects such as sidewalks, roadways, fences, storm drains, or other metallic gratings to become energized by faults to the underground distribution system.

       Each electric distribution company and natural gas distribution company conducting business in the state shall, on or before May 15, 2022, and annually thereafter, submit to the division an emergency response plan for review and approval. The emergency response plan shall be designed for the reasonably prompt restoration of service in the case of an emergency event, which is an event where widespread outages have occurred in the service area of the company due to storms or other causes beyond the control of the company.

       After review of an electric distribution or natural gas distribution company’s emergency response plan, the division may request that the company amend the plan. The division may open an investigation of the company’s plan. If, after hearings, the division finds a material deficiency in the plan, the division may order the company to make such modifications that it deems reasonably necessary to remedy the deficiency.

       Any investor-owned electric distribution or natural gas distribution company that fails to file its emergency response plan may be fined five hundred dollars ($500) for each day during which the failure continues.

       Each investor-owned electric distribution or natural gas distribution company, when implementing an emergency response plan, shall designate an employee or employees to remain stationed at the Rhode Island emergency management agency’s emergency operations center for the duration of the emergency when the emergency operations center is activated in response to an emergency with an electric or gas service restoration component. In the event of a virtual activation of the emergency activation center, each investor-owned electric and natural gas distribution company shall designate an employee or employees to participate in the virtual activation. The employee or employees shall coordinate communications efforts with designated local and state emergency management officials, as required by this section.

       Each investor-owned electric distribution or natural gas distribution company, when implementing an emergency response plan, shall designate an employee or employees to serve as community liaisons for each municipality within their service territory. An investor-owned electric distribution or natural gas distribution company shall provide each community liaison with the necessary feeder map or maps outlining municipal substations and distribution networks and up-to-date customer outage reports at the time of designation as a community liaison. An investor-owned electric distribution or natural gas distribution company shall, at a minimum, provide each community liaison with three (3) customer outage report updates for each twenty-four-hour (24) period, to the liaison’s respective city or town. The community liaison shall utilize the maps and outage reports to respond to inquiries from state and local officials and relevant regulatory agencies.

       On or before October 1 of each year, every city or town shall notify each investor-owned electric distribution or natural gas distribution company and the Rhode Island emergency management agency of the name of the emergency management official or designee responsible for coordinating the emergency response during storm restoration.

If, after evidentiary hearings or other investigatory proceedings, the division finds that, as a result of the failure of the company to follow its approved emergency response plan, the length of the outages were materially longer than they would have been but for the company’s failure, the division shall recommend that the commission enter an order denying the recovery of all, or any part of, the service restoration costs through distribution rates, commensurate with the degree and impact of the service outage.

      The division shall open a docket and establish standards of acceptable performance for emergency preparation and restoration of service for each investor-owned electric and gas distribution company doing business in the state. The division shall levy a penalty not to exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) for each violation for each day that the violation of the division’s standards persists; provided, however, that the maximum penalty shall not exceed seven million five hundred thousand dollars ($7,500,000) for any related series of violations. The division shall open a full investigation, upon its own initiative. Nothing herein shall prohibit any affected city or town from filing a complaint with the division regarding a violation of the division’s standards of acceptable performance by an investor-owned electric distribution or natural gas distribution company; provided, however, that the petition shall be filed with the division no later than ninety (90) days after the violation has been remedied. After an initial review of the complaint, the division shall make a determination as to whether to open a full investigation.

     <p>
      No public utility, whether privately owned or a quasi-public agency, shall distribute electricity or furnish or sell gas in any town or city in which any other public utility is at the time distributing electricity or furnishing or selling gas to the public generally, unless the public utility desiring to distribute electricity or to furnish or sell gas shall first have obtained a certificate from the division of public utilities and carriers certifying that public convenience and necessity require the same. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to require a certificate to be obtained as a condition of distributing electricity or furnishing or selling gas in any town or city by any public utility that was actually distributing electricity or furnishing or selling gas to the public generally in the town or city on or prior to January 1, 1996, or by any successor to the public utility. The division shall not grant the certificate to any electric distribution company if the electric distribution company that is distributing electricity in the town or city offers to provide distribution service to all customers served by any nonregulated power producer, whether affiliated or not, on comparable prices and terms approved pursuant to this title, including the transition charge pursuant to § 39-1-27.4. A copy of any application filed by the Block Island Power Company with either the commission or the division shall be provided by the Block Island Power Company to the New Shoreham town clerk by certified mail.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Purchasing cooperatives may at any time be organized consisting of any group of electricity consumers for the purpose of negotiating for electric power from nonregulated power producers. The purchasing cooperatives shall be considered to be associations of electricity consumers organized solely for the purpose of negotiating the purchase of electric power by members of the cooperative. Purchasing cooperatives are specifically not required to be legal entities and are hereby prohibited from engaging in resale of electric power. Electricity consumers will maintain individual accounts with the nonregulated power producer with which a contract is concluded. Electricity consumers may withdraw from a purchasing cooperative at any time by providing thirty (30) days’ notice to the cooperative and to nonregulated power producers with which a purchasing cooperative has reached an agreement. Nothing in this section shall prevent a cooperative from becoming a legal entity or utilizing a legal entity to negotiate for rates for the purchasing cooperative.

         The legislative authority of a municipality may adopt an ordinance or resolution, under which it may aggregate in accordance with this section one or more classes of the retail electrical loads located, respectively, within the municipality or town and, for that purpose, may enter into service agreements to facilitate for those loads the sale and purchase of electricity. The legislative authority also may exercise this authority jointly with any other legislative authority. An ordinance or resolution under this section shall specify whether the aggregation will occur only with the prior consent of each person owning, occupying, controlling, or using an electric load center proposed to be aggregated or will occur automatically for all persons pursuant to the opt-out requirements of this section. Nothing in this section, however, authorizes the aggregation of retail electric loads of an electric load center that is located in the certified territory of a nonprofit electric supplier or an electric load center served by transmission or distribution facilities of a municipal electric utility.
        </li>
        <li id="t39c03s39-3-1.2ol1a2">
         No legislative authority pursuant to an ordinance or resolution under this section that provides for automatic aggregation as described in this section, shall aggregate the electrical load of any electric load center located within its jurisdiction unless it in advance clearly discloses to the person owning, occupying, controlling, or using the load center that the person will be enrolled automatically in the aggregation program and will remain so enrolled unless the person affirmatively elects by a stated procedure not to be so enrolled. The disclosure shall state prominently the rates, charges, and other terms and conditions of enrollment. The stated procedure shall allow any person enrolled in the aggregation program the opportunity, at a minimum, to opt-out of the program every two (2) years, without paying a switching fee. Any person who leaves the aggregation program pursuant to the stated procedure shall default to the last-resort service until the person chooses an alternative supplier.

      <li id="t39c03s39-3-1.2ol1b">
       A governmental aggregator under this section is not a public utility engaging in the wholesale purchase and resale of electricity, and the aggregated service is not a wholesale utility transaction. A governmental aggregator shall be subject to supervision and regulation by the commission only to the extent of any competitive retail electric service it provides and commission authority.

      <li id="t39c03s39-3-1.2ol1c">
       A town may initiate a process to authorize aggregation by a majority vote of a town meeting or of the town council. A city may initiate a process to authorize aggregation by a majority vote of the city council, with the approval of the mayor, or the city manager. Two (2) or more municipalities may, as a group, initiate a process jointly to authorize aggregation by a majority vote of each particular municipality as required in this section.

      <li id="t39c03s39-3-1.2ol1d">
       Upon the applicable requisite authority under this section, the legislative authority shall develop a plan of operation and governance for the aggregation program so authorized. Before adopting a plan under this section, the legislative authority shall hold at least one public hearing on the plan. Before the hearing, the legislative authority shall publish notice of the hearing once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the jurisdiction. The notice shall summarize the plan and state the date, time, and location of any hearing. A municipality or group of municipalities establishing load aggregation pursuant to this section shall develop a plan, for review by its citizens, detailing the process and consequences of aggregation. The plan shall identify which classes of customers may participate, based on their applicable electric distribution company tariff or rate schedule. Any municipal load aggregation plan established pursuant to this section shall provide for universal access to all applicable customers and equitable treatment of applicable classes of customers and shall meet any requirements established by law or the commission concerning aggregated service. The plan shall be filed with the commission, for its final review and approval, and shall include, without limitation, an organizational structure of the program, its operations, and its funding; the process for establishing rates and allocating costs among participants; the methods for entering and terminating agreements with other entities; the rights and responsibilities of program participants; and termination of the program. The plan must also include the terms and conditions under which retail customers who or that have chosen to opt-out of the aggregated service may take service from the aggregated entity. At the time of the legislative authority’s filing of the plan with the commission, a copy of the proposed plan filing shall be provided to the electric distribution company whose customers would be included in the plan. Prior to its decision, the commission shall conduct a public hearing. Following approval of the plan, the legislative authority may solicit bids from nonregulated power producers pursuant to the methods established by the plan. The legislative authority shall report the results of this solicitation and proposed agreement awards to the commission. The legislative authority shall have the right to terminate the operation of the plan by placing its customers on last-resort service. If the legislative authority terminates the operation of the plan and places customers on last-resort service, a municipality seeking to form a new municipal aggregation load must submit a new plan to the commission for approval, in accordance with this section, before the customers may enroll in a new aggregation program.

         Any retail customer in a municipality with an approved aggregation plan may elect instead to receive retail supply from another licensed retail supplier or from the local distribution company. Within thirty (30) days of the date the aggregated entity is fully operational, ratepayers who or that have not affirmatively elected an alternative authorized supplier shall be transferred to the aggregated entity subject to the opt-out provision in this section. Following adoption of aggregation as specified above, the program shall allow any retail customer to opt-out and choose any supplier or provider that the retail customer wishes. Nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing any city or town or any municipal retail load aggregator to restrict the ability of retail electric customers to obtain or receive service from any authorized provider of it.
        </li>
        <li id="t39c03s39-3-1.2ol1e2">
         It shall be the duty of the aggregated entity to fully inform participating ratepayers in advance of automatic enrollment that they are to be automatically enrolled and that they have the right to opt-out of the aggregated entity without penalty. In addition, such disclosure shall prominently state all charges to be made and shall include full disclosure of the standard-offer rate, how to access it, and the fact that it is available to them without penalty, if they are currently on standard-offer service. The commission shall furnish, without charge, to any citizen a list of all other supply options available to them in a meaningful format that shall enable comparison of price and product.

       The municipality or group of municipalities shall, within two (2) years of approval of its plan, or such further time as the commission may allow, provide written notice to the commission that its plan is implemented. The commission may revoke certification of the aggregation plan if the municipality or group of municipalities fails to substantially implement the plan.

      <li id="t39c03s39-3-1.2ol1g">
       The commission may, from time to time, promulgate rules by which the legislative authority may request information from the electric distribution company or companies whose customers would be included in its plan. These rules shall ensure that municipalities have reasonable and timely access to information pertinent to the formation of the plan and solicitation of bids to serve customers; that confidentiality of individuals is protected; and that charges for production of data are reasonable and not unduly burdensome to the legislative authority.

        Town’s contention that the notice given by the water company and the public utilities commission of the changes in the initial rate increase filing failed to comply with § 42-35-9 was without merit where the company filed its request for a rate increase pursuant to this section, and consequently all action subsequently taken by the company and the public utilities and carrier commission with respect to the initial filing was subject to the provisions of this section, including both the company’s obligation to notify its customers of the filing, and the commission’s obligation to hold a public hearing on the propriety of the rate increase; and therefore, the notice requirements under the APA were inapplicable when title 39 explicitly directed the parties on the appropriate course of action in a rate proceeding.

        The public utilities commission discharged its duty to suspend a proposed schedule of rates by rejecting the schedule within eight months of their being proposed. Moreover, this section does not require the commission to put into effect substitute rates offered after the proposed rates have been rejected since there is no requirement that a rate become effective within the eight-month period, but merely that an order issue.

        Supreme court upheld commission ruling where subsidiary utility sought rate increase to insure cash working capital adequate to cover time lag between payment of its bills for power purchases from its interstate supplier and receipt of payment from its customers, and commission disallowed the increase because the subsidiary was unnecessarily paying its bills before the end of the “grace period” allowed by its supplier, thereby losing interest.

        Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission properly denied a rate increase to a water supply board in order to reimburse a city for sums paid for board retirees’ health-care. As the city did not prove that the reimbursement it sought was a repayment of loans made under an existing contract or agreement, R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-3-11.1’s exemption to the general rule against retroactive ratemaking did not apply. In re Providence Water Supply Board's Application,

        Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission (PUC) properly denied a rate increase to a water supply board in order to reimburse a city for the sums it paid for board retirees’ health-care. The PUC was not required to accept the board’s extrapolation of the costs of the health care paid by the city in place of the actual, verifiable proof necessary to sustain a general rate filing.

      The proceedings for obtaining the consent and approval of the division for such authority shall be as follows: There shall be filed with the division a petition, joint or otherwise, as the case may be, signed and verified by the president and secretary of the respective companies clearly setting forth the object and purposes desired; stating whether or not it is for the purchase, sale, lease, or making of contracts or for any other purpose in § 39-3-24 provided; and also the terms and conditions of the same. The division shall upon the filing of the petition, if it deem a hearing necessary, fix a time and place for the hearing thereof. If, after the hearing, or, in case no hearing is required, the division is satisfied that the prayer of the petition should be granted; that the facilities for furnishing service to the public will not thereby be diminished; and that the purchase, sale, or lease and the terms thereof are consistent with the public interest, it shall make such order in the premises as it may deem proper and the circumstances may require.

      The division shall have full power and authority to investigate any contract, arrangement, purchase, or sale, and if the division, after notice and hearing, shall find the contract, arrangement, purchase, or sale to be unjust or unreasonable, the division may make such reasonable order relating thereto as the public good requires. In any such investigation, the burden shall be on the public utility or affiliate to prove the reasonableness of any contract, arrangement, purchase, or sale with, from, or to an affiliate. If the public utility shall fail to satisfy the division of the reasonableness of any contract, arrangement, purchase, or sale, the division may disapprove the same, or disallow payments thereunder or the part of any payment as the division shall find to be unjust or unreasonable, or both disapprove and disallow as aforesaid. No payment disallowed by the division shall be capitalized or included as an operating cost of the public utility in the fixing of rates or as an asset in fixing a rate base. If, in any investigation, the public utility or affiliate shall unreasonably refuse to comply with any request of the division for information with respect to relevant accounts and records, whether of the public utility or any affiliate, any portion of which may be applicable to any transaction under investigation, so that parts thereof as the division may deem material may be made part of the record, the refusal shall justify the division in disapproving the transaction under investigation and disallowing payments in pursuance thereof.

Laws § 39-4-10 in imposing a 3-year moratorium on a water transport company’s entry into the high-speed water ferry market as the company had undertaken substantial steps toward acquiring high-speed capacity, and the Supreme Court of Rhode Island interpreted R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-4-10 as including planning within the definition of “practice, act or service.” Interstate Navigation Co. v. Div. of Pub. Utils. &amp; Carriers of R.I.,

      Whenever the division shall be of the opinion that a public utility, subject to its supervision, is failing or omitting, or about to fail or omit, to do anything required of it by law or by order of the division, or is doing anything, is about to do anything, or is permitting anything, or is about to permit anything to be done contrary to or in violation of law or of any order of the division, it shall direct the attorney general to commence an action or proceeding in the supreme court in the name of the division for the purpose of having the violations or threatened violations prevented. The attorney general shall thereupon begin the action or proceeding by petition to the supreme court, alleging the violation or threatened violation complained of, and praying for appropriate relief. It shall thereupon be the duty of the court to specify a time not exceeding twenty (20) days after the service of the copy of the petition, within which the public utility complained of must answer the petition, and in the meantime the public utility may be restrained. In the case of a default in answering, or after the answer, the court shall immediately inquire into the facts and circumstances of the case. Such corporations or persons as the court may deem necessary or proper to be joined as parties in order to make its judgment, order, or writ effective, may be joined as parties. The final judgment in any action or proceeding, shall either dismiss the action or proceeding or direct that appropriate relief be granted as prayed for in the petition, or in modified or other form.

        A city has standing to seek judicial review of the commission’s declaratory judgment that an electric cogeneration facility is not under the commission’s supervision. The city is able to demonstrate a potential adverse effect on property within the city if the facility’s coal burning is not regulated by the commission. In addition, the case involves substantial public interest, i.e., the interests of the city residents who will be injured by the commission’s denial of the opportunity to justify the city’s ordinance in the administrative arena of the commission.

        Federal court had jurisdiction of petition to enjoin new rate promulgated by commission for furnishing of electrical energy by state public utility to a Massachusetts corporation, rather than by appeal from order of commission to state supreme court, where the commission failed to make a finding of reasonableness of new rate, since a judicial question between citizens of different states was involved.

        In reviewing the public utilities commission’s decisions and orders in regulatory proceedings, the supreme court does not engage in fact-finding or weigh conflicting evidence presented to the commission; its inquiry is limited to determination of whether commission’s ruling is lawful and reasonable and whether its findings are fairly and substantially supported by legal evidence.

        In a public utility rate case review, the court does not sit as a fact finder; its role is to determine whether the commission’s decision and order are lawful and reasonable and whether its findings are fairly and substantially supported by legal evidence and substantially specific to enable the court to ascertain if the facts upon which they are premised afford a reasonable basis for the result reached. However, if the commission fails to set forth sufficiently the findings and the evidentiary basis upon which it rests its decision, the court shall not speculate thereon or search the record for supporting evidence or reasons, nor shall it decide what is proper. Instead, it shall remand the case in order to provide the commission an opportunity to fulfill its obligations in a supplementary or additional decision. New Shoreham v. Rhode Island Pub. Utils.

        In setting rates, the commission has a duty to consider attrition or erosion of the utility’s earnings; but where the commission denies relief for erosion, its decision is presumptively reasonable and the utility then must show by clear and convincing evidence that the denial is clearly, palpably and grossly unreasonable.

        When the Public Utilities Commission (PUC), in evaluating a utility company’s request to modify the company’s capital structure, relied on the capital structure of the company’s twice removed foreign parent, the PUC committed error because (1) there was no evidence of the parent’s services, (2) no expert testified about the propriety of the PUC’s reliance, (3) there was no in-depth analysis of the company’s place in the parent’s structure, and (4) no witness testified about viewing the parent and company as an “integrated entity.” Narragansett Elec.

        While the Supreme Court, in reviewing an order of the commission will not engage in fact finding, it will determine whether the commission’s decision and order are lawful and reasonable and whether its findings are fairly supported by legal evidence and sufficiently specific to enable the court to ascertain if the facts upon which they are premised afford a reasonable basis for the result reached.

        The supreme court’s role on appeal from a ratemaking decision is limited to a determination of whether the commission acted illegally, arbitrarily, or unreasonably, the court will not weigh conflicting evidence nor will it substitute its judgment for that of the commission. South County Gas Co. v. Burke,
        <cite class="ocri">

       <p>
        In reviewing a decision and order of the Public Utilities Commission, the supreme court will consider the fairness and reasonableness of the end result achieved by the commission, not the methodology by which that decision was reached. South County Gas Co. v. Burke,
        <cite class="ocri">
         486 A.2d 606
        </cite>

        (R.I. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        In examining a decision and order of the commission, the Supreme Court neither weighs conflicting evidence nor engages in independent factfinding. The court accepts the commission’s findings of fact as prima facie true, and refuses to disturb an order promulgated in the exercise of its administrative discretion unless the commission clearly exceeds its statutory authority or acts illegally, arbitrarily, or unreasonably. South County Gas Co. v. Burke,
        <cite class="ocri">
         551 A.2d 22
        </cite>
        ,

        </cite>
        (R.I. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The factfinding task is expressly reserved for the commission, and the court is not to substitute its judgment for the commission’s. The court determines whether the decision is lawful, reasonable, and well supported by the evidence, while affording great deference to decisions of the commission in its rate-making regulatory capacity. Providence Gas Co. v. Malachowski,
        <cite class="ocri">
         600 A.2d 711

        (R.I. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The role of fact-finder is that of the commission alone, and review by the Supreme Court is only to determine whether the commission’s decision is fairly and substantially supported by legal evidence and sufficiently specific to enable the court to ascertain if the facts upon which the commission’s decision is premised afford a reasonable basis for the result reached.

        Whether the Division of Public Utilities and Carriers was required to approve a power sales agreement before a municipal electric utility corporation could enter such an agreement was a determination of mixed questions of law and fact and accorded the same deference on review as other aspects of factfinding by a trial justice.

        Rhode Island Supreme Court’s standard of review in Public Utilities Commission matters is strictly prescribed by R.I. Gen.

        Substantial evidence supported a decision by the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission (PUC) determining that employees of a county water authority (CWA) should pay a portion of their health insurance expenses because most other water utilities in Rhode Island required their employees to contribute toward their health insurance and nothing in R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-16-5 divested the PUC of its statutory authority to determine what rates were just and reasonable; the PUC had denied the CWA’s application for a rate increase of 35 percent.

        When the Public Utilities Commission (PUC), in evaluating a utility company’s request to modify the company’s capital structure, declined to use a structure the company was implementing at the time of the PUC’s decision, the PUC’s decision was not disturbed on judicial review because the decision was entitled to great deference.

        Public Utilities Commission order fully comported with a regulated electric and gas distribution company’s settlement proposal, and the company was not required to continue to escrow the interconnection tax funds being paid to it by the solar energy system operators or to refund what it held in escrow; the explicit language of the proposal very definitely did not state that the funds would be held in escrow until the IRS clarified the state of the law.

        There was no error on the part of the Public Utilities Commission in determining that a regulated electric and gas distribution company’s conclusion was reasonable because due to the uncertainty in the law, it was eminently reasonable of the company to come to the decision that it had to continue to pay an interconnection tax to the IRS and pass that tax on to solar energy system operators.

The commission upon receiving the new evidence may confirm, alter, amend, rescind, or reverse the judgment or order which was appealed, and shall report its action to the court forthwith transmitting therewith a transcript of the new testimony. If the commission rescinds or reverses its prior judgment or order, the appeal shall be dismissed. If the prior order or judgment is confirmed, or if it is altered or amended, the altered or amended judgment or order shall be substituted for the original order or judgment, and the proceedings in the supreme court shall continue accordingly.

       Declaration of policy regarding abandoned railroad property.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The general assembly finds and declares that the preservation of open spaces and the orderly control and development of unused or undeveloped land bears a substantial relationship to the public health, safety, and welfare of the people of this state. When a railroad is granted permission to abandon any rail line by the Interstate Commerce Commission and gives up use of the entire width of its right of way in that area, an opportunity is afforded for the establishment of a facility for another means of transportation or for a necessary public recreation or conservation area in the community land which was not theretofore readily available. Railroads, by reason of their statutory privilege of land acquisition by condemnation and statutory protection from acquisition of their land by condemnation, are a proper subject for a special statutory procedure for the disposition of their unused or undeveloped lands.

      If the railroad shall agree with the acquiring authority upon the sum to be paid, and the price shall be approved by the state properties committee, the sum agreed shall be paid to the railroad upon delivery of proper instruments of conveyance. If no agreement as to the price to be paid is reached within one year following the abandonment, then within six (6) months thereafter, or if the abandoned right of way has not been disposed of otherwise, then at any time thereafter, the acquiring authority may petition the superior court for one of the counties in which the land is situated for an assessment by a judge thereof of the fair value to be paid for the estate or interest in the land. A hearing on the petition shall be conducted as in other civil actions, and either party shall have the right to appeal the decision as provided by law. Within thirty (30) days after a final judgment is entered, the acquiring authority shall tender payment in accordance therewith to the railroad and receive proper instruments of conveyance. If the acquiring authority shall fail to make tender within the time allowed, the railroad shall be at liberty to dispose of the land or any estate or interest therein in any manner it shall see fit.

     <p>
      Whenever the department determines that any rail properties acquired by the state are no longer needed for railroad purposes, it may, with the permission of the governor, permanently or temporarily transfer the rail properties to any other state department or agency, or political subdivision of the state, which shall utilize the properties for a public purpose. Whenever more than one department or agency, or political subdivision, wishes to utilize the property, the department shall resolve such a conflict and make a prompt determination of the reasonable and proper order of priority, taking into consideration any applicable state plans, policies, and objectives. If no state department or agency or political subdivision wants the properties, the department may sell them; provided, however, that all dispositions shall be with the approval of the state properties committee.

An exemption may be granted from any and all requirements of this section; provided, however, that any exemption must be limited to the specific bridge, viaduct, or other obstructions upon agreement between the department of transportation, public utilities administrator, railroad company, and the designated labor representative representing the railroad employees whose duties are to be atop of cars while in motion; provided, further, the agreement shall fix and prescribe reasonable regulations governing the location exempted; and provided, further, that an agreement between the aforesaid parties must be consummated within fifteen (15) days from the date of the request for an exemption from any and all requirements of this section. In case of failure to consummate an agreement, the public utilities administrator shall issue an order on the request for an exemption. The public utilities administrator shall, when issuing an order, take into consideration that his or her paramount responsibility in his or her decision to issue the exemption must be the safety of the railroad employees whose duties are to be atop of cars while in motion.

     <p>
      If the city or town council of any city or town where a turnpike or highway crossed by a railroad on a level therewith is situated, is of the opinion that it is necessary for the security of the public that the turnpike or highway should be raised or lowered, so as to pass over or under the railroad, it may request in writing that the corporation owning the railroad raise or lower the turnpike or highway. If the corporation neglects or refuses to do so, the city or town council may apply to the commission to decide upon the reasonableness of the request. If the commission, after due notice and hearing the parties, shall decide that the lowering or raising of grade is necessary for the security of the public, the corporation shall comply with the decision; provided, that either party shall have the right, in accordance with chapter 5 of this title, to petition the supreme court for relief, and the court shall have full power to finally decide the question as to the necessity of changing the grade. The cost and expense of making the change of grade shall be borne by the railroad corporation and the city or town asking for the change, in the proportion as may be decided by the court. If, after the decision of the court that a change of grade is necessary, or if, having taken no appeal from the decision of the commission, the corporation shall unreasonably neglect or refuse to change the grade, the city or town council may proceed to make the change, and may, in an action against the corporation, recover all charges and expenses occasioned by making the alterations.

Failure to remove or clear the debris shall permit the public utilities commission to issue orders to the designated railroad official in charge of the yard or having jurisdiction over the complained-of area or switch to take the track or tracks or switch out of service until the orders have been complied with by the railroad corporation; provided the action shall not affect freight or passenger service, or in the alternative, assess a penalty not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100) per day until the order is complied with.

         Additionally, the public utilities commission, upon having reasonable cause to believe that a railroad corporation that owns or controls a right-of-way in this state is not complying with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section with respect to rights-of-way, shall conduct an investigation to determine whether a dangerous or unhealthy condition exists on an affected right-of-way. If the public utilities commission determines that a dangerous or unhealthy condition exists on an affected right-of-way, the commission shall send notice, by certified mail, to the local agent of the railroad corporation describing the condition and location of the right-of-way. The railroad company shall correct the condition not later than ten (10) days from the date the notice was mailed, otherwise the public utilities commission shall assess a penalty not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100) per day until the condition is rectified.

      At any point where a highway, city or town way, or traveled place is crossed at the same level by a railroad where a gate or flagperson is not maintained, the commission may, after notice to and hearing of the railroad corporation whose road so crosses, direct that the crossing shall be furnished with electric signal or signals as they shall decide the better security of human life or the convenience of the public travel requires, and the corporation shall comply with the order. If the railroad corporation shall refuse or neglect to comply with the order within three (3) months from the date thereof, it shall be fined twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for each day that the refusal or neglect shall continue unless it shall furnish reasons satisfactory to the commission for the refusal or neglect. Nothing in this section shall be so construed as to affect §§ 39-8-9 and 39-8-10.

        City’s request for proposals requiring towing companies to remit a referral fee to the city was invalid because enforcement of the Towing Storage Act, R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 39, ch. 12.1, rested with the state Division of Public Utilities and there was no transfer or delegation of that authority to the cities and towns; further, R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-12-12 contained language that prohibited a towing company from refunding or remitting, in any manner, any portion of its fee. Thus, state law explicitly prohibited towing companies from both refunding money to a customer and from transmitting any portion of the rates or charges to anyone in any manner, including the person or entity that selected the tow company.

        City’s request for proposals requiring towing companies to remit a referral fee to the city was invalid because enforcement of the Towing Storage Act, R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 39, ch. 12.1, rested with the state Division of Public Utilities and there was no transfer or delegation of that authority to the cities and towns; further, R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-12-12 contained language that prohibited a towing company from refunding or remitting, in any manner, any portion of its fee. Thus, state law explicitly prohibited towing companies from both refunding money to a customer and from transmitting any portion of the rates or charges to anyone in any manner, including the person or entity that selected the tow company.

In conducting an investigation and/or hearing, the person so designated by the administrator shall be vested with all powers conferred on the administrator by this chapter; and upon completion of the investigation and/or hearing, the party hearing or investigating shall decide the matter at issue in hearing or under investigation and shall file his or her decision and findings in writing with the administrator, and his or her decision or finding when signed by the administrator shall be deemed the decision and order of the administrator.

Motor carriers, lessors, or persons shall submit their accounts, books, records, memoranda, correspondence, or other documents, relating to motor carrier activities only, for the inspection and copying authorized by this section, and motor carriers and lessors shall submit their equipment for examination and inspection, to any duly authorized examiner, investigator, or regulatory inspector upon demand and the display of proper credentials. The administrator shall have the power to administer oaths; summon and examine witnesses; and order the production and examination of books, accounts, records, memoranda, correspondence, and other documents in any proceeding within the jurisdiction of the administrator. All subpoenas and orders for the production of books, accounts, papers, records, and documents shall be signed and issued by the administrator and served as subpoenas in civil cases in the superior court are now served, and witnesses so subpoenaed shall be entitled to the same fees for attendance and travel as are now provided for witnesses in civil cases in the superior court.

Upon return of the order, the justice before whom the matter is brought for a hearing shall examine under oath the person, and the person shall be given an opportunity to be heard, and if the justice shall determine that the person has refused without reasonable cause or legal excuse to be examined or to answer a legal question and a pertinent question, or to produce books, accounts, records, memoranda, correspondence, or other documents material to the issue that he or she was ordered to bring or produce, the justice may immediately commit the offender to jail, there to remain until he or she submits to do the act for which he or she was required to do, or is discharged according to law.

       Requirement of certificate of public convenience and necessity for common carriers — Application.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no person shall engage in the business of transporting property for compensation in intrastate commerce over the publicly used highways as a common carrier, unless there shall be in force with respect to the carrier a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the administrator authorizing the operations. Every person proposing to operate as a common carrier shall file with the administrator, in the form to be provided by him or her, an application for a certificate, accompanied by a fee of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250). All revenues received under this section shall be deposited as general revenues. Each application for a certificate shall be made in writing; shall be verified by oath or written declaration that it is made under penalties of perjury; and shall contain such information as the administrator may require. The administrator shall, within a reasonable time, fix the time and place of hearing on every application. Notice of the hearing shall be given by publication or by written notice mailed by the administrator at least ten (10) days before the date fixed thereof to all common carriers, including railroad companies, if any, serving any part of the route or territory proposed to be served by the applicant; to each person filing with the administrator a written request for the notice; and to any other person who may, in the opinion of the administrator, be interested in or affected by the issuance of the certificate. The copy of the notice, including a list of the applications to be heard, shall be publicly posted in the office of the administrator. Any person having an interest in the matter shall have the right, in accordance with rules prescribed therefor by the administrator, to make representations and to introduce evidence in favor of or in opposition to the issuance of the certificate.

       Permit requirement for contract carriers — Application.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no person shall engage in the business of transporting property as a contract carrier by motor vehicle, in intrastate commerce, over the publicly used highways of this state, unless there is in force, with respect to the carrier, a permit issued by the administrator authorizing the person to engage in the business. Every person proposing to operate as a contract carrier shall file with the administrator, in the form to be provided by him or her, an application for a permit, accompanied by a fee of one hundred dollars ($100). All revenues received under this section shall be deposited as general revenues. Each application for the permit shall be made in writing; be verified under oath or written declaration that it is made under penalties of perjury; and shall contain such information as the administrator may require. The administrator shall, within a reasonable time, fix the time and place of the hearing on every application. Notice of the hearing shall be given by publication or by written notice, mailed by the administrator at least ten (10) days before the date fixed therefor, to all common and contract carriers, including railroad companies, if any, serving any part of the route or territory proposed to be served by the applicant; to each person filing with the administrator a written request for the notice; and to any other person who may, in the opinion of the administrator, be interested in or affected by the issuance of the permit. A copy of the notice, including a list of the applications to be heard, shall be publicly posted in the office of the administrator. Any person having an interest in the matter shall have the right, in accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed therefor by the administrator, to make representations and to introduce evidence in favor of or in opposition to the issuance of the permit.

Permits issued under this chapter shall be renewed before the close of business on December 31 of each calendar year. The renewal fee shall be one hundred dollars ($100) and shall be submitted with the renewal form. All revenues received under this section shall be deposited as general revenues. The administrator shall specify in the permit the business of the contract carrier covered thereby and the scope thereof; and he or she shall attach to it at the time of issuance, and from time to time thereafter, such reasonable terms, conditions, and limitations consistent with the character of the holder as a contract carrier, as the public interest may require, but may in no way limit the number of contracts that the contract carrier may hold under the permit. The contract carrier shall have the right to substitute or add to his or her or its equipment and facilities as the development of the business may require.

     <p>
      It shall be the duty of every common carrier of property by motor vehicle to establish, observe, and enforce just, reasonable, and reasonably compensatory rates, charges, and classification, and reasonable regulations and practices relating thereto, which shall become effective on a date fixed by the carrier, which shall be at least thirty (30) days after the filing of the tariff containing the rates, charges, and classification, unless suspended by the administrator, prior to the effective date of the tariff or classification, upon complaint of any person, organization, or body politic or by the administrator on his or her own motion. No change shall be made in any rate, charge, classification, or any rule, regulation, or practice affecting the rate, charge, or classification, or the value of the service thereunder specified in any tariff of a common carrier by motor vehicle, except after thirty (30) days’ notice of the proposed change filed and posted in accordance with § 39-12-11. The notice shall plainly state the changes proposed to be made and the time when the change will take effect. The administrator, in his or her discretion and for good cause shown, may allow the publication of rates or charges or a change in classification therein, upon notice less than that specified in this section, or may modify the requirements of this section with respect to the posting and filing of tariffs and classifications, either in particular instances or by general order applicable to special or peculiar circumstances or conditions. The administrator, after a hearing, may establish, from time to time, such reasonable rules and regulations as he or she may deem necessary pertaining to the form of tariffs, classifications, or supplements thereto; the time and manner of filing thereof; the suspension of rates before the rates become effective; and bearing upon the validity of any filed or existing rate. No common carrier of property by motor vehicle shall charge or demand or collect or receive a greater or less compensation for transportation or any service in connection therewith between points enumerated in the tariff than the rates and charges specified in the filed tariffs in effect at the time; and no carrier shall refund or remit in any manner or by any device, directly or indirectly, or through any other person, any portion of the rates or charges so specified, or extend to any person any privileges or facilities for transportation in intrastate commerce, except such as are specified in its tariffs.

        City’s request for proposals requiring towing companies to remit a referral fee to the city was invalid because enforcement of the Towing Storage Act, R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 39, ch. 12.1, rested with the state Division of Public Utilities and there was no transfer or delegation of that authority to the cities and towns; further, R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-12-12 contained language that prohibited a towing company from refunding or remitting, in any manner, any portion of its fee. Thus, state law explicitly prohibited towing companies from both refunding money to a customer and from transmitting any portion of the rates or charges to anyone in any manner, including the person or entity that selected the tow company.

      In the exercise of power to prescribe just and reasonable rates and charges for the transportation of property by common carriers by motor vehicle, and classifications, regulations, and practices relating thereto, and to disallow rates filed by any carriers, the administrator shall give due consideration, among other factors, to the inherent advantages of transportation by the carriers; to the effect of rates upon the movement of traffic by the carrier or carriers for which the rates are prescribed; to the need, in the public interest, of adequate and efficient transportation service of the carriers at the lowest cost consistent with the furnishing of the service; and to the need of revenues sufficient to enable the carriers under honest, economical, and efficient management to provide such service. In any proceeding to determine the justness and reasonableness of any rates or charges of any common carrier, there shall not be taken into consideration or allowed, as evidence or elements of value of the property of the carrier, either good will, earning power, or the certificate under which the carrier is operating. At any hearing involving a change in rates, charges, or classification, or in a rule, regulation, or practice, the burden of proof shall be upon the carrier to show that the proposed rule, changed rate, charge, classification, regulation, or practice is just and reasonable.

      Any party in interest, whether as a contract carrier, common carrier, shipper, or otherwise, may, at any time, by petition or complaint, have determined whether a rate or charge prescribed for the contract carrier by the administrator, after a hearing, is based upon or includes services that the contract carrier is not required to perform under his or her contract for services. No rates or charges for contract carriers shall be prescribed by the administrator except after a hearing, notice of which has been given to the contract carriers and common carriers affected thereby, and to the shippers or to the public served by the contract carriers and common carriers. Upon a petition of not less than ten (10) persons operating as common or contract carriers in any natural subdivision, the administrator, after a hearing, and after notice to members of the natural subdivision in writing, or by publication, as the administrator may determine, shall prescribe the rates and charges, which shall not be less than the cost of performing the service, to be thereafter charged by all carriers operating within the natural subdivision for the particular type of service described in the petition, but the rates and charges shall not apply to members of the subdivision performing services other than those described in the petition.

     <p>
      Any common-carrier certificate or any contract-carrier permit may be assigned and transferred, in whole or in part, by the holder thereof, his or her assignee, receiver, trustee, or by the holder’s personal representative, or by the surviving partner or partners of the deceased partner to which the rights and privileges under the certificate or permit shall pass at the death of the holder, upon his or her application to the administrator. The transfer and assignment must receive the consent and approval of the administrator, after public notice, in the manner provided in §§ 39-12-6 and 39-12-9, and a public hearing, at which the proposed transferee shall have established to the satisfaction of the administrator his or her willingness, fitness, and ability to perform or furnish transportation for compensation under the certificate or permit. No certificate or permit may be transferred in part, unless the rights are clearly severable; and no certificate or permit shall be transferred, in whole or in part, except in connection with the bona fide sale to the transferee of the business of the transferor. The application shall be accompanied by a fee of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250). All revenues received under this section shall be deposited as general revenues. It shall be unlawful for any person to accomplish or effectuate or to participate in accomplishing or effectuating the control or management in a common interest of any two (2) or more common carriers, however such a result is attained, whether directly or indirectly, by use of common directors, officers, or stockholders, or in any manner whatsoever. As used in this section, the words “control and management” shall be construed to include the power to exercise control and management. The holder of either a common-carrier certificate or a contract-carrier permit shall not acquire the operating rights held by another person through a transfer proceeding unless, both operating rights are merged simultaneously and not until the application to transfer is approved by the administrator.

      Every motor carrier engaged in transporting property over the highways of this state for compensation, in interstate commerce, shall file an application with the administrator for a permit of registration. The application shall be accompanied by a fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00). Upon a showing by the carrier that it has been authorized by the Interstate Commerce Commission to conduct an operation into, from, within, or through this state, and that the carrier is in compliance with all other requirements of this chapter, the administrator shall issue a permit of registration to the carrier as soon as possible, and the carrier shall not so operate in interstate commerce unless and until the permit of registration shall have been issued. The motor carrier shall be required to file with the administrator only that portion of its interstate authority permitting operations within the borders of this state, and the motor carrier shall not be required to file with the administrator emergency or temporary operating authority having a duration of thirty (30) consecutive days or less, if the carrier has registered its interstate authority and registered and identified its vehicles under the provisions of this chapter. The administrator shall prescribe reasonable rules and regulations governing the registration of interstate authority. Every intrastate motor carrier holding either a common-carrier certificate or a contract-carrier permit from the administrator is hereby granted the right to operate motor vehicles in interstate commerce in the transportation of property for compensation, as authorized by the Interstate Commerce Commission, without obtaining an interstate permit of registration from the administrator.

     <p>
      Every interstate motor carrier engaged in the transportation of property for compensation over the highways of this state, subject to the provisions of this chapter, shall register and identify all vehicles to be operated in the state in accordance with the provisions contained in and mandated under the federal “Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users” (SAFETEA-LU) (Public Law 109-59, enacted August 10, 2005), the Unified Carrier Registration Act of 2005 (Included within SAFETEA-LU), and the Unified Carrier Registration Agreement (UCRA) (§§ 4302 — 4308 of SAFETEA-LU), and/or any related successor federal law(s). All intrastate carriers not subject to the provisions of the foregoing federal law shall apply to the administrator for the issuance of a vehicle identification device for the registration and identification of vehicles and shall be assessed twenty dollars ($20.00) for each identification device for which an application is made. All revenues received shall be deposited as general revenues. The identification device shall be furnished annually to every carrier whose duty it shall be to apply for it. It shall be unlawful for any motor vehicle to be engaged in transporting property for compensation in either intrastate or interstate commerce without the owner of it having applied for and received the required identification device, unless the vehicle is exempted from the provisions of this chapter. Each identification device shall be accompanied by a registration card issued by the administrator, which shall be in the possession of the vehicle’s driver when the vehicle is operating. Transfers of the identification device from one vehicle to another are hereby prohibited unless authorized by the administrator. The administrator, in his or her discretion, may refuse to reissue the identification device to the holder of any certificate, permit, or permit of registration, pending any complaint or hearing upon the question of revocation or suspension or in which such question is involved. The administrator shall prescribe reasonable rules and regulations governing the registration and identification of motor vehicles authorized for operation under this chapter. Violations of this section are subject to fines enumerated in § 31-41.1-4.

     <p>
      No certificate or permit shall be issued to a motor carrier or remain in force, unless the carrier shall have furnished the administrator with evidence of insured financial responsibility. Each motor carrier shall satisfy the requirements by furnishing the administrator with proof of the carrier’s ability to meet any and all legally established claim or claims for damages by reason of personal injury to, or the death of, any one person in an amount of at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000), or by reason of personal injuries to, or the death of, all persons injured or killed in any one accident of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) (subject to a maximum of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) for bodily injuries to or the death of one person), and for damages to property (excluding cargo) in the amount of at least twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000). A filing fee of ten dollars ($10.00) must accompany each insurance filing. All revenues received under this section shall be deposited as general revenues. No common or contract carrier by motor vehicle shall engage in intrastate commerce, nor shall any certificate or permit be issued to the carrier or remain in force, unless and until there shall be filed with the administrator evidence of insured financial responsibility by the carriers to meet any and all legally established claim or claims for loss or damage to all property belonging to the shipper or consignee and coming into possession of the carriers in connection with their motor carrier transportation service in an amount of at least twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000); provided, however, that the requirements of this section shall not apply in connection with the transportation of commodities declared by the administrator, after notice and hearing, to be exempt from cargo insurance requirements. Each motor carrier required by the provisions of this chapter to furnish evidence of insured financial responsibility shall satisfy such requirements by filing with the administrator:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t39c12s39-12-27ol11">
       A certificate of insurance issued by an insurance company authorized to transact business in this state, showing that the motor carrier has a policy of insurance in force insuring the carrier against public liability, property damage, and damage or loss to cargo, in at least the minimum amounts herein prescribed; or
      </li>
      <li id="t39c12s39-12-27ol12">
       A certificate on blanks furnished by the administrator and issued by the general treasurer that the motor carrier has filed with the general treasurer a bond in the amount of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in Rhode Island and conditioned upon payment of any sum up to and including the maximum amounts required in this section in the satisfaction of any final judgment rendered as the result of any claim, or claims, for damages against the motor carrier. The administrator will give consideration to and will approve the application of a motor carrier to qualify as a self-insurer in lieu of the insurance prescribed in this section, if the carrier furnishes a true and accurate statement of its financial condition and other evidence as will establish to the satisfaction of the administrator the ability of the motor carrier to satisfy its obligations for liability and bodily injury or death and liability for the property damage in the minimum amounts prescribed therein without affecting the stability or permanency of the business of the motor carriers. All certificates of insurance, surety bonds, and other securities and agreements filed with the administrator must show the coverage effective continuously until canceled. Certificates of insurance, surety bonds, and other securities and agreements shall not be canceled or withdrawn until after thirty (30) days’ notice in writing by the insurance company, surety or sureties, motor carrier, or other party thereto, as the case may be, has first been given to the administrator at his or her office in Providence, which period of time shall commence to run from the date the notice is actually received at the office of the administrator. However, the surety bonds, certificates of insurance, and other securities and agreements may be canceled prior to the expiration of the thirty (30) days, if on or before the date notice of cancellation is received at the office of the administrator, a replacement filing acceptable to the administrator shall have been received, the replacement being effective on or before the effective date of the cancellation. No cancellation may become effective before the date of receipt of the notice by the administrator.

      Any common carrier subject to the provisions of this chapter, receiving property for transportation between points within this state, shall issue a receipt or bill of lading therefor, and shall be liable to the lawful holder thereof for any loss, damage, or injury to the property caused by it or by any other common carrier to which the property may be delivered or over whose line or lines the property may pass within this state when transported on a through bill of lading, and any common carrier so receiving property for transportation between points within this state or any common carrier delivering the property so received and transported shall be liable to the lawful holder of the receipt or bill of lading or to any party entitled to recover thereon, whether the receipt or bill of lading has been issued or not, for the actual loss, damage, or injury to the property caused by it or by any common carrier to which the property may be delivered or over whose line or lines the property may pass within this state when transported on a through bill of lading notwithstanding any limitation of liability or limitation of the amount of recovery or representation or agreement as to value in any receipt or bill of lading, or any contract, rule, regulation, or in any tariff filed with the administrator; and the limitation without respect to the manner or form in which it is sought to be made is hereby declared to be unlawful and void; provided, however, that the provisions hereof respecting liability for full actual loss, damage, or injury, notwithstanding any limitation of liability or recovery or representation or agreement or release as to value and declaring any limitation to be unlawful and void, shall not apply to property received for transportation concerning which the motor carrier shall have been or shall hereafter be expressly authorized or required by order of the administrator to establish and maintain rates dependent upon the value declared in writing by the shipper or agreed upon in writing as the released value of the property, in which case the declaration or agreement shall have no other effect than to limit liability and recovery to an amount not exceeding the value so declared or released; and any tariff or schedule which may be filed with the administrator pursuant to the order shall contain specific reference thereto and may establish rates varying with the value so declared and agreed upon; and the administrator is hereby empowered to make the order in cases where rates dependent upon and varying with declared or agreed value would, in his or her opinion, be just and reasonable under the circumstances surrounding the transportation; provided, further, that nothing in this chapter shall deprive any holder of a receipt or bill of lading of any remedy or right of action which he or she has under existing law; provided, further, that it shall be unlawful for any motor common carrier to provide by rule, contract, regulation, or otherwise, a shorter period for the filing of claims than nine (9) months, and for the institution of suits than two (2) years, the period for institution of suits to be computed from the day when notice in writing is given by the carrier to the claimant that the carrier has disallowed the claim or any part or parts thereof specified in the notice; and, provided, further, that the liability imposed in this section shall also apply to property reconsigned or diverted in accordance with the applicable tariff filed as in this chapter provided. The common carrier issuing the receipt or bill of lading, or delivering the property so received and transported, shall be entitled to recover from the common carrier over whose lines the loss, damage, or injury shall have been sustained, the amount of the loss, damage, or injury as it may be required to pay to the owners of the property, as may be evidenced by any receipt, judgment, or transcript thereof, and the amount of any expense reasonably incurred by it in defending the action at law brought by the owners of the property.

      The legislature hereby finds the following legislation to be in the public interest for these reasons:

      WHEREAS, The operation of a tow truck on the public highway with a vehicle in tow is a dangerous instrumentality exposing others on or about the highway to loss or damage, which must be covered by adequate insurance; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, The motoring public has a right, when delegating to law enforcement the selection of an operator in the towing-storage business, to expect that the operator selected and responding will be competent; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, The motoring public has a right when delegating to law enforcement the selection of an operator in the towing-storage business, to expect that the charges for the services to be rendered will be reasonable and compensatory, and that the operator is physically equipped in his or her business to function properly; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, The towing and storage of a vehicle without the owner’s consent, as is the case in most police-instigated tows, requires certain procedures to assure the owner that rights of due process of law are not violated; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, The owner or person in control of private property of real estate has a right to be free from trespass by vehicle on the private property; and to have any trespassing vehicle removed at the owner’s expense; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, The police powers delegated by the legislature of the state include the power of the police, even without the owner’s consent, to have public ways cleared of conditions that, in the opinion of the officer, create a hazardous condition to the motoring public; to have removed abandoned, abandoned and of no value, and unattended vehicles; to have removed and/or relocated vehicles in violation of parking ordinances; and to have removed any vehicle under control of any person arrested for any criminal offense; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, The process of selection of the operator of a towing-storage business for police work is unique in that law enforcement, though having the legal duty to order the work, has no legal duty to pay costs and charges connected therewith, the same being the duty of the vehicle owner.

        City’s request for proposals requiring towing companies to remit a referral fee to the city was invalid because enforcement of the Towing Storage Act, R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 39, ch. 12.1, rested with the state Division of Public Utilities and there was no transfer or delegation of that authority to the cities and towns; further, R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-12-12 contained language that prohibited a towing company from refunding or remitting, in any manner, any portion of its fee. Thus, state law explicitly prohibited towing companies from both refunding money to a customer and from transmitting any portion of the rates or charges to anyone in any manner, including the person or entity that selected the tow company.

       <p>
        City’s request for proposals requiring towing companies to remit a referral fee to the city was invalid because enforcement of the Towing Storage Act, R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 39, ch. 12.1, rested with the state Division of Public Utilities and there was no transfer or delegation of that authority to the cities and towns; further, R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-12-12 contained language that prohibited a towing company from refunding or remitting, in any manner, any portion of its fee. Thus, state law explicitly prohibited towing companies from both refunding money to a customer and from transmitting any portion of the rates or charges to anyone in any manner, including the person or entity that selected the tow company.

     <p>
      Every motor carrier engaged in transporting passengers over the highways of this state for compensation in interstate commerce, shall file an application with the administrator for a permit of registration. The application shall be accompanied by a fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00). Upon a showing by the carrier that it has been authorized by the Interstate Commerce Commission to conduct an operation into, from, within, or through this state, and that the carrier is in compliance with all other requirements of this chapter, the administrator shall issue a permit of registration to the carrier as soon as possible and the carrier shall not so operate in interstate commerce unless and until the permit of registration shall have been issued. The motor carrier shall be required to file with the administrator only that portion of its interstate authority permitting operations within the borders of this state, and the motor carrier shall not be required to file with the administrator emergency or temporary operating authority having a duration of thirty (30) consecutive days or less, if the carrier has registered its interstate authority and registered and identified its vehicles under the provisions of this chapter. The administrator shall prescribe reasonable rules and regulations governing the registration of interstate authority. Each intrastate motor carrier holding a common-carrier certificate from the administrator is hereby granted the right to operate motor vehicles in interstate commerce in the transportation of passengers for compensation, as authorized by the Interstate Commerce Commission without obtaining a permit of registration from the administrator.

     <p>
      Every interstate motor carrier engaged in the transportation of passengers for compensation over the highways of this state, subject to the provisions of this chapter, shall apply to the administrator for the issuance of a vehicle identification device for the registration and identification of vehicles. The application shall be accompanied by a filing fee in the amount of eight dollars ($8.00) for each identification device applied for. All intrastate carriers shall be assessed twenty dollars ($20.00) for each identification device for which an application is made; provided, however, that this fee shall not apply to any city or town, or any agency or department of any city or town of the state, or any nonprofit jitney service utilized for the transportation of senior citizens. All revenues received under this section shall be deposited as general revenues. The identification device shall be furnished annually to every carrier whose duty it shall be to apply therefor. It shall be unlawful for any motor vehicle to be engaged in transporting passengers for compensation in either intrastate or interstate commerce without the owner thereof having applied for and received the required identification device, unless the vehicle is exempted from the provisions of this chapter. Each identification device shall be accompanied by a registration card issued by the administrator which shall be in the possession of the vehicle’s driver when the vehicle is in operation. Transfers of the identification device from one vehicle to another are hereby prohibited. The administrator in his or her discretion may refuse to reissue the identification device to the holder of any certificate, permit, or permit of registration, pending any complaint or hearing upon the question of revocation or suspension or in which the question is involved. The administrator shall prescribe reasonable rules and regulations governing the registration and identification of motor vehicles authorized for operation under this chapter.

        An ambulance service providing both emergency services and transportation of patients between facilities is a common carrier. Therefore, if an ambulance is engaged in emergency services or is a municipal ambulance providing services outside of a hospital, the gross negligence standard of care applies. If, however, the ambulance is part of a private ambulance service and is providing non-emergency transportation at the time of injury, the ambulance is exempted from § 23-4.1-12 and the gross negligence standard does not apply.

     <p>
      Every person owning or operating a motor vehicle engaged or to be engaged in operating a taxicab or limited public motor vehicle is declared a common carrier and subject as such to the jurisdiction of the division of public utilities and carriers. The division shall prescribe such rules and regulations as it shall deem proper to assure adequate, economical, safe, and efficient service at reasonable charges without unjust discrimination, undue preference or advantages, or unfair or destructive competitive practices. The division may require common carriers to prepare records and to preserve them, and to make such reports to it as shall disclose to the division the character of service rendered, the safety of equipment used, and the safety of operation, the character of the management and conduct of the common-carrier business, and its relation to and control of or by other carriers or other businesses. Upon complaint or upon his or her own initiative, the administrator may investigate or conduct a hearing as to compliance by any common carrier with the provisions of this title or regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, and shall issue orders as his or her findings shall indicate to be necessary or desirable for the public welfare. The findings of the administrator shall be reported in writing and copies thereof shall be furnished to the parties involved.

      Every taxicab or limited public motor vehicle shall file with the public utilities administrator current schedules that shall be open to public inspection, showing all rates, tolls, and charges it has established and that are in force at the time for any service performed by it within the state, or for any service in connection therewith or performed by any taxicab or limited public motor vehicle controlled or operated by it. A copy of so much of the schedules as the administrator shall deem necessary for the use of the public shall be printed in plain type or typewritten, and kept on file in every station or office of the taxicab or limited public motor vehicle, open to the public in such form and place as to be readily accessible and conveniently inspected, as the administrator may order. The administrator may determine and prescribe the form in which the schedules, required by this section to be kept open to public inspection, shall be prepared and arranged.

Transfers of the identification device from one vehicle to another are hereby prohibited unless authorized by the administrator. The administrator, in his or her discretion, may refuse to reissue the identification device to the holder of any certificate or permit pending any complaint or hearing upon the question of revocation or suspension or in which such question is involved. The administrator shall prescribe reasonable rules and regulations governing the registration and identification of motor vehicles authorized for operation under this chapter.

       “Transportation network company services” or “prearranged ride” means the provision of transportation by a TNC driver to a TNC rider beginning when a TNC driver accepts a TNC rider’s request for a ride made only through a digital network controlled by a transportation network company (TNC), continuing while the TNC driver transports the requesting TNC rider(s), and ending when the last requesting TNC rider(s) departs from the personal vehicle. TNC services and prearranged rides do not include transportation provided using a jitney, as defined in § 39-13-1; a taxicab or limited public motor vehicle, as defined in § 39-14-1; a public motor vehicle, as defined in § 39-14.1-1; a common carrier as defined in this title; or a regional transportation provider. TNC services and prearranged rides do not include a shared-expense carpool or vanpool arrangement or service.

The claim shall stand for trial by jury upon a proper issue based upon the claim, as other cases upon the docket of the court, and shall be tried in the court in every respect as other cases are there tried, including the right to object to rulings and to move for new trials for cause; and execution may be awarded thereon as in other cases; but if the party claiming the jury trial shall not therein obtain an award for damages more favorable to him or her than that given by the commissioners, he or she shall pay costs to the adverse party.

       Revenue stabilization.  Water suppliers subject to commission rate regulation shall in the absence of other sufficient funds available for similar purposes, establish as part of their next general rate filing before the commission a revenue-stabilization account to ensure fiscal stability during periods when revenues decline as a result of implementing water conservation programs, or due to circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the water supplier, including, but not limited to, the weather and drought. A revenue-stabilization account shall accumulate a maximum of ten percent (10%) of the annual operating expenses of the supplier and shall be used to supplement other revenues so that the supplier’s reasonable costs are compensated. A supplier may draw upon its revenue-stabilization account without further action of the commission if revenues in any fiscal year fall below the level sufficient to provide reasonable compensation for services rendered, subject to periodic review by the commission to ensure that the purposes of § 39-15.1-1 are fulfilled.

For the purpose of encouraging conservation of water, suppliers are authorized to request increased rates based on quantity used either throughout the year or seasonally and to seek expedited review by the commission of such revised rates, provided that the supplier shall not have the burden of proof to link the increased rate to obtaining reasonable compensation for the service rendered as established in § 39-3-12. Conservation pricing shall be designed to promote efficient water use, and to limit seasonal non-agricultural outdoor water use, and to the extent possible shall not increase prices for water users with no significant seasonal increase in water use. Revenues generated from the adoption of conservation rates shall be used to fund the revenue-stabilization account established pursuant to subsection (c) above, operating reserves, debt-service reserves or capital improvement/infrastructure replacement funds.

        Substantial evidence supported a decision by the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission (PUC) determining that employees of a county water authority (CWA) should pay a portion of their health insurance expenses because most other water utilities in Rhode Island required their employees to contribute toward their health insurance and nothing in R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-16-5 divested the PUC of its statutory authority to determine what rates were just and reasonable; the authority of the CWA to set employees’ compensation pursuant to § 39-16-5 and the authority of the PUC to set utility rates were separate and distinct functions.

The proceeds of bonds or notes issued for the purpose of refunding outstanding bonds or notes may be applied, in the discretion of the authority, to the purchase, retirement at maturity, or redemption of the outstanding bonds or notes, either on their earliest or a subsequent redemption date, and may, pending that application, be placed in escrow. Any escrowed proceeds may be invested and reinvested in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States, or in certificates of deposit, time deposits, or repurchase agreements fully secured or guaranteed by the state or the United States, or an instrumentality of either, maturing at such time or times as shall be appropriate to ensure the prompt payment, as to principal, interest, and redemption premium, if any, of the outstanding bonds or notes to be so refunded.

       The authority shall have the power to acquire any transit property or any interest therein by the exercise of the power of eminent domain.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c18s39-18-6ol1b">
       The necessity for acquisition shall be conclusively presumed upon the adoption by the authority of a resolution declaring that the acquisition of the transit property or interest therein described in the resolution is necessary to provide transit services. Within six (6) months thereafter, in the event of acquisition by eminent domain, the authority shall cause to be filed in the land evidence records of the city or town in which the transit property is located (for the purpose of this section, all personal property shall be deemed to be located in the city or town where the transit company has its principal place of business), a copy of the resolution of the authority, together with a description of the property or interest therein and a statement signed by the chairperson of the authority that the property is taken pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. Thereupon, the authority shall file in the superior court, in and for the county in which the transit property is located, a statement of the sum of any estimate by the authority to be just compensation for the property taken. If the property is located in more than one county, the statement shall be filed in the superior court in and for the county where the transit company has its principal place of business.

       Upon the filing by the authority of the copy of resolution, description, and statement in the land evidence records of the city or town, the filing in the superior court of the statement and the depositing in the superior court to the use of the persons entitled thereto of the sum as the court shall determine to be amply sufficient to satisfy the claims of all persons having an estate or interest in the property (and the court may in its discretion take evidence on the question to determine the sum to be deposited), title to the property shall vest in the authority absolutely and in fee simple, and the authority thereupon may take possession of the property. No sum so paid into the court shall be charged with clerk’s fees of any nature.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c18s39-18-6ol1d">
       After the filing of the copy of resolution, description, and statement, notice of the taking of the property shall be served upon the owners of and persons having an estate in or interest in the property by the sheriff or his or her deputies of the county in which the property is located, leaving a true and attested copy of the description and statement with each of the persons personally or at their last and usual place of abode in this state with some person living there, and in case any of the persons are absent from this state and have no last and usual place of abode therein occupied by any person, the copy shall be left with the persons, if any, in charge of or having possession of the property, or interest therein, taken of such absent persons if the same are known to the officer; and after the filing of the copy of resolution, description, and statement, the secretary of the authority shall cause a copy of the resolution and statement to be published in some newspaper, published or having general circulation in the county where the property, or interest therein, may be located, at least once a week for three (3) successive weeks. If any person shall agree with the authority for the price of the property or interest therein so taken, the court upon the application of the parties in interest, may order that the sum agreed upon be paid forthwith from the money deposited, as the just compensation to be awarded in the proceeding.

Upon filing of the petition, the court shall cause twenty (20) days’ notice of the pendency thereof to be given to the authority by serving the chairperson of the authority with a certified copy thereof, and may proceed after such notice to the trial thereof; and the trial shall determine all questions of fact relating to the value of property, or interest therein, and the amount thereof, and judgment shall be entered upon the verdict, and execution shall be issued therefor against the money so deposited in court and in default thereof against any other property of the authority. In case two (2) or more conflicting petitioners make claim to the same property, or to any interests therein, or to different interests in the same piece of property or parcel of land, the court upon motion shall consolidate their several petitions for trial at the same time, and may frame all necessary issues for the trial thereof; and all proceedings taken pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall take precedence over all other civil matters then pending before the court, or if the superior court in and for the county in which such property, or interest therein, lies, be not in session in the county, then the trial may be heard in the superior court for the counties of Providence and Bristol.

       If any properties, or interests therein, in which any minor or other person not capable in law to act in his or her own behalf is interested, are taken by the authority under the provisions of this chapter, the superior court, upon the filing therein of any petition by or in behalf of the minor or other person, may appoint a guardian ad litem for the minor or other person, and the guardian may appear and be heard on behalf of the minor or other persons; and the guardian may also, with the advice and consent of the superior court, and upon such terms as the superior court may prescribe, release to the authority all claims for damages for the lands of the minor or other person or for any interests therein. Any lawfully appointed, qualified, and acting guardian or other fiduciary of the estate of any minor or other person, with the approval of the court of probate within this state having jurisdiction to authorize the sale of lands and properties within this state of any minor or other person, may, before the filing of any petition, agree with the authority upon the amount of damages suffered by the minor or other person by any taking of his or her property, or of his or her interests in any property, and may, upon receiving the amount, release to the authority all claims for damages of the minor or other person for the taking.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c18s39-18-6ol1g">
       Whenever, from time to time, the authority has satisfied the court that the amount deposited with the court is greater than is amply sufficient to satisfy the claims of all persons having estates or interests in the property, the court may order that the amount of any excess, including any interests or increment of any sums so deposited, shall be repaid to the authority. Whenever the authority has satisfied the court that the claims of all persons interested in land taken have been satisfied, the unexpended balance, including any interest or increment on any sums so deposited, shall be paid forthwith to the authority.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c18s39-18-6ol1h">
       At any time during the pendency of any proceedings for the assessment of damages for property or interests therein taken, or to be taken, by eminent domain by the authority, the authority or any owner may apply to the court for an order directing an owner or the authority, as the case may be, to show cause why further proceedings should not be expedited, and the court may, upon application, make an order requiring that the hearings proceed and that any other steps be taken with all possible expedition.

The bonds shall be signed by the chairperson of the authority or shall bear his or her facsimile signature, and the official seal of the authority, or a facsimile thereof, shall be impressed or imprinted thereupon and attested by the secretary of the authority, and any coupons attached to the bonds shall bear the facsimile signature of the chairperson of the authority. In case any officer whose signature or facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be the officer before the delivery of the bonds, the signature or the facsimile shall, nevertheless, be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he or she had remained in office until delivery. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone, and also as to both principal and interest, for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest, and for the interchange of registered and coupon bonds. The authority may sell such bonds in such manner either at public or private sale and for the price as it may determine will best effect the purposes of this chapter.

       The proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be disbursed in the manner and under restrictions, if any, as the authority may provide in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust agreement described in § 39-18-8 securing the bonds.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c18s39-18-7ol1c">
       Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the authority may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when the bonds shall have been executed and are available for delivery. The authority may also provide for the replacement of any bonds that shall become mutilated or shall be destroyed or lost. Except as provided in the following paragraph, bonds may be issued under the provisions of this chapter without obtaining the consent of any department, division, commission, board, bureau, or agency of the state, and without any other proceedings or the happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions, or things that are specifically required by this chapter.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c18s39-18-7ol1d">
       No bonds shall be issued by the authority unless, at the time of the adoption by the authority of the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds, the authority shall have received from the general manager or chief financial officer of the authority a certificate indicating that the payments of principal (including any payments made to a reserve fund other than payments made from bond proceeds) and interest on the bonds, together with the payments of the principal and interest on all other then outstanding bonds of the authority, will not exceed during any fiscal year of the authority eighty percent (80%) of the revenues (including, without limitation, grants and other aid) of the authority during the fiscal year. In determining the amount of the principal and interest payments to be made during any fiscal year, there shall be deducted any payments to be made from a reserve fund previously established to provide for the payments. The certificate shall be based upon the reasonable expectations (both as to the amount of revenues to be received by the authority and as to the maximum amount of any variable payments to be made on the bonds) of the officer of the authority executing the certificate at the time the certificate is delivered. The certificate shall describe with reasonable particularity the calculations of principal and interest payments and of anticipated revenues upon which the certificate is based. A copy of the certificate shall be furnished to the governor prior to the issuance of the bonds described in the certificate and, in the case of any bonds whose issuance, according to the certificate, is expected to result in the aggregate amount of principal and interest payments (calculated as above) on the bonds and all then outstanding bonds of the authority exceeding in any fiscal year of the authority fifty percent (50%) of the revenues of the authority, the bonds shall not be issued unless the governor shall have approved the issuance or not disapproved the issuance within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the certificate. Approval or disapproval of any bond issue by the governor shall be evidenced by delivery to the authority of a certificate approving or disapproving the issue or any part thereof.

     <p>
      Bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter may be secured by trust agreement by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. The trust agreement or the resolution providing for the issuance of the bonds may pledge or assign the revenues to be received, but shall not convey or mortgage any transit property or any part thereof. The trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of the bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including, without limitation, covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys, and conditions or limitations with respect to the issuance of additional bonds. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the state that may act as depositary of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Any trust agreement may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. In addition to the foregoing, any trust agreement or resolution may contain other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of the trust agreement or resolution may be treated as a part of the authority’s cost of operation and maintenance. Bonds may also be secured by insurance or by letters of credit, or in any other manner deemed appropriate by the authority not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, or may be unsecured.

The revenues derived from the authority’s operations and any other funds or property received or to be received by the authority (including, without limitation, any funds or other property received or to be received by the authority pursuant to § 39-18-4(a)(10)), in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, may be pledged to, and charged with, the payment of the principal of and the interest on some or all of the authority’s bonds as provided for in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust agreement securing the bonds. The pledge shall be valid and binding from the time when the pledge is made; the revenues, funds, or other property so pledged, and thereafter received by the authority, shall immediately be subject to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any pledge shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind, in tort, contract, or otherwise, against the authority, irrespective of whether the parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any trust agreement by which a pledge is created need be filed or recorded except in the records of the authority.

If, after a period of ten (10) days from the date of the appointment of the two (2) arbitrators representing the authority and the labor organization, the third arbitrator has not been selected, then either arbitrator may request the American arbitration association to furnish a list of five (5) persons from which the third arbitrator shall be selected. The arbitrators appointed by the authority and the labor organization promptly after the receipt of the list, shall determine by lot the order of elimination, and, thereafter, each shall in that order alternately eliminate one name until only one name remains. The remaining person on the list shall be the third arbitrator. The term “labor dispute” shall be broadly construed and shall include any controversy concerning wages, salaries, hours, working conditions, or benefits, including health and welfare, sick leave, insurance, or pension or retirement provisions, but not limited thereto, and including any controversy concerning any differences or questions that may arise between the parties, including, but not limited to, the making or maintaining of collective bargaining agreements, the terms to be included in the agreements and the interpretation or application of the collective bargaining agreements and any grievances that may arise. Each party shall pay one-half (1/2) of the expenses of the arbitration.

Funds appropriated to the authority pursuant to this section shall be administered by the department of transportation in accordance with procedures established jointly by the departments of transportation and administration. The authority shall annually submit to the department of transportation a comprehensive budget request for funds for the ensuing fiscal year. Prior to the beginning of each fiscal year, the authority shall enter into an agreement with the departments of administration and transportation establishing the conditions for payment of the available state and federal subsidies. The director of administration is authorized, from time to time, to advance funds from the general fund to the Rhode Island public transit authority to be used for the purpose of this section, in anticipation of transfers from the revenues reserved pursuant to § 31-36-20, provided that the aggregate of all advances less transfers, at any one time, shall not exceed the total amount of the annual appropriation.

       Rhode Island now has, and for some years has had, a serious shortfall of funds available for the upkeep, maintenance, and repair of the state’s highways, roads, and bridges.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c18.1s39-18.1-2ol12">
       Rhode Island now funds, and for some years has funded, the local twenty percent (20%) match required to bring federal transportation dollars into the state by means of selling bonds. This has proven unsustainable and creates unaffordable debt-service obligations for future generations of Rhode Island taxpayers.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c18.1s39-18.1-2ol13">
       The health, safety, and convenience of Rhode Island’s citizens are seriously and adversely affected when the state’s highways, roads, and bridges are not kept in a proper state of upkeep, maintenance, and repair.

       A critically important function of the state in maintaining the health, safety, and welfare of all the people of Rhode Island is to ensure the proper upkeep, maintenance, and repair of the state’s highways, roads, and bridges.

      <li id="t39c18.1s39-18.1-2ol15">

      <li id="t39c18.1s39-18.1-2ol16">
       Additional stable and secure funding sources are absolutely necessary in order for the state to carry out its essential functions, including the upkeep, maintenance, and repair of the state’s highways, roads, and bridges, and providing for the continued functioning and reliability of public transit. In order to avoid to the full extent possible the creation of enormous and unaffordable debt-service obligations for future generations of Rhode Islanders, these funding sources should be created on a pay-as-you-go basis, and bonding should be reduced to the fullest extent practicable.

      The division shall supervise and regulate every CATV company operating within this state so far as may be necessary to prevent the operation from having detrimental consequences to the public interest, and for this purpose may promulgate and enforce such reasonable rules and regulations as it may deem necessary with reference to issuance of certificates, territory of operation, abandonment of facilities, elimination of unjust discrimination among subscribers, financial responsibility, and insurance covering personal injury and property damage, safety of equipment and operation, and filing of reports. No certificates shall be issued or remain valid unless the applicant has filed with the division and revised to keep current a schedule of rates and charges for its services. The rates and charges shall be reasonably compensatory so as not to encourage unfair or destructive competitive practices and shall be applied without discrimination. The cable television section of the division of public utilities and carriers shall take all necessary steps to ensure that Rhode Island shall regulate the rates charged by cable television companies to the full extent allowable under federal law; provided, however, the division shall hold public hearings and the cable television companies shall justify and explain at the hearings the necessity for all rate increases of regulated rates.

A CATV operator or other telephone, telecommunications, or information service provider shall be permitted to affix CATV systems facilities pursuant to this subsection prior to receiving a request for service from a tenant.

The owner may waive, in writing, the prior presentation of the plans and specifications. The CATV operator or other telephone, telecommunications, or information service provider shall be responsible for the maintenance of any equipment installed on the owner’s premises and shall be entitled to reasonable access for maintenance.

In determining the damages to any real estate injured when no part of it is being taken, consideration is to be given only to such injury as is special and peculiar to the real estate, and there shall be deducted therefrom the amount of any benefit to the real estate by reason of the installation of CATV, telephone, telecommunications, or information system facilities.

      <li id="t39c21.1s39-21.1-1ol1a">
       The purpose of this chapter is to establish the number 911 as the primary emergency telephone number for use in the state and to develop and improve emergency communications procedures and facilities with the objective of reducing the response time to emergency calls for law enforcement, fire, medical, rescue, and other emergency services.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c21.1s39-21.1-1ol1b">
       It is hereby declared by the general assembly that:
       <ol>
        <li id="t39c21.1s39-21.1-1ol1b1">
         Availability and type of 911 service in the state.  The citizens of this state enjoy enhanced 911 service where a public safety answering point (PSAP) telecommunicator receives the 911 call, the pertinent information about the nature and location of the emergency by questioning the caller, and confirms the telephone number and address of the calling party. E-911 saves lives and property by helping emergency services personnel do their jobs more quickly and efficiently.
        </li>
        <li id="t39c21.1s39-21.1-1ol1b2">
         E-911 capabilities.  E-911 information includes Automatic Location Identification (ALI), which permits the prompt dispatch of emergency assistance to the street address of the wireline phone. This capability is especially important where the caller is disoriented, disabled, unable to speak, or does not know his or her location. ALI also reduces the errors in reporting the location of the emergency and in forwarding accurate information to emergency personnel. Automatic Number Identification (ANI) allows the number of the calling party to be displayed at the PSAP. With ANI, the PSAP can call back the party if the call is disconnected. The general assembly finds that ALI and ANI are critical components of effective emergency services.
        </li>
        <li id="t39c21.1s39-21.1-1ol1b3">
         Wireless 911 capabilities.  Mobility, the primary advantage of wireless technologies, creates complexities for providing E-911 service, necessitating special action for wireless E-911 services.
        </li>
        <li id="t39c21.1s39-21.1-1ol1b4">
         The need for wireless E-911 services.  It has been reported that the total number of wireless subscribers in the United States exceeds 42 million, and 9.6 million new subscribers were added in 1995 alone. Currently, there are almost thirty thousand (30,000) new wireless subscribers each day, amounting to a forty percent (40%) annual growth rate. Industry studies report that a majority of new subscribers cite safety and security as a primary reason for purchasing a mobile phone. These statistics underscore the growing popularity of mobile communications. With this growth, wireless customers place a large and increasing portion of 911 emergency calls received by PSAPs. In 1994 alone, almost eighteen million (18,000,000) wireless calls were made nationwide to 911 and other public service numbers. It is in the health and safety interests of the citizens of this state that wireless 911 services be enhanced to provide critical ALI and ANI information.
        </li>
        <li id="t39c21.1s39-21.1-1ol1b5">
         The FCC mandate for wireless E-911.  In July, 1996, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) took several important steps to foster major improvements in the quality and reliability of wireless 911 services (FCC Docket No. 94-102). The FCC directed wireless carriers to deliver wireless E-911 information to PSAPs by April 1, 1998. The FCC also directed that wireless carriers, by October 1, 2001, identify to the PSAP the latitude and longitude of a mobile unit making an E-911 call within a radius of no more than one hundred twenty-five (125) meters in sixty-seven percent (67%) of all cases.
        </li>
        <li id="t39c21.1s39-21.1-1ol1b6">
         PSAP’S ability to receive wireless E-911 information.  Currently, E-911 does not have the necessary systems, facilities, and trained personnel to receive ANI and ALI on wireless calls. It is in the health and safety interests of the citizens of this state that PSAPs have the capability to receive and process wireless E-911 calls, and to require standards of quality of service, performance of service, and technological compliance of all providers of telecommunication services.
        </li>
        <li id="t39c21.1s39-21.1-1ol1b7">
         Conditions for providing wireless E-911.  The FCC mandate only applies if (a) PSAPs capable of receiving and utilizing the data elements associated with the E-911 services formally request such services from the wireless carriers in their jurisdiction and (b) a mechanism for the recovery of costs relating to the provision of such services is available. The FCC left it to each state to ensure that a mechanism is in place to permit carriers to recover costs associated with providing E-911 services. The general assembly finds that it is in the public interest to ensure that the conditions imposed by the FCC on wireless carriers to provide E-911 services are met as soon as possible so that the citizens of this state will have more reliable and efficient wireless emergency services.
        </li>
        <li id="t39c21.1s39-21.1-1ol1b8">
         The need for a funding mechanism.  Wireline Enhanced 911 services in the state are funded by telephone subscribers. Wireless 911 services are not funded. Funding for wireless E-911 service will be necessary to ensure PSAPs have the necessary systems to be capable of receiving E-911 information from wireless carriers. Further, given the continued rise in the use of wireless communications, PSAPs will experience increasing demand and incur additional costs for ongoing operation and maintenance of the emergency 911 system. Wireless carriers will incur costs to upgrade systems to be capable of meeting the FCC mandate and will incur a continuous cost in providing E-911 information. The general assembly finds that the principal purpose of wireless E-911 funding is for wireless carriers to recover the costs of providing E-911 services and therefore to fulfill the FCC mandate.
        </li>
        <li id="t39c21.1s39-21.1-1ol1b9">
         Establishment and purpose of an E-911 emergency services fund.  To ensure that adequate and sustained funding for E-911 statewide emergency services exists so that wireless and wireline E-911 systems can be implemented, maintained, and provided at optimum technical levels, and E-911 services performed at optimum skill levels, the legislature finds that it is necessary and proper to establish a “911 emergency services fund.” The 911 emergency services fund shall be the cost recovery mechanism for all E-911 service providers and shall serve as the means through which PSAP upgrades, including upgrades required to receive E-911 information from wireless carriers, may be implemented and maintained.
        </li>
        <li id="t39c21.1s39-21.1-1ol1b10">
         Indemnification.  Given the complexity of providing E-911 services, the general assembly finds that it is appropriate to provide immunity from civil liability for landline and wireless E-911 service providers. Further, the general assembly finds that to encourage innovation in the provision of emergency services, it is in the public interest to also extend immunity by statute to any person that provides equipment or services for the establishment, maintenance, or operation of E-911 services. Immunity would not extend to willful or wanton acts of misconduct by the E-911 service provider or its employees and agents.

      The general assembly finds and hereby declares the following:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t39c25s39-25-2ol11">
       The citizens of the state whose homes are in close proximity to proposed high-voltage lines have expressed concern about the possible harmful effect of electromagnetic fields that emanate from the electrical utilities facilities;
      </li>
      <li id="t39c25s39-25-2ol12">
       There have been a number of scientific studies that purport to suggest that the electromagnetic fields associated with electrical utility facilities may present a significant health risk;
      </li>
      <li id="t39c25s39-25-2ol13">
       The issue of the adverse health effects of human exposure to electromagnetic radiation has been the subject of newspaper and scientific journal articles, and although to date no firm data exists indicating at what levels this radiation may pose certain health risks, scientific studies and preliminary evidence warrant an approach of prudent avoidance;
      </li>
      <li id="t39c25s39-25-2ol14">
       While the general assembly recognizes that at present, research data neither provides a basis for asserting that magnetic fields pose a significant health risk nor does it allow one to categorically assert that there are no risks. Prudence, therefore, suggests caution in dealing with electromagnetic fields and public health issues until further research permits a more conclusive determination.

       “Minimum long-term contract capacity” means ninety megawatts (90 MW) of which three megawatts (3 MW) must be solar or photovoltaic projects located in the state of Rhode Island. In determining whether the minimum long-term contract capacity has been reached, the capacity under contract shall be adjusted by the capacity factor of each renewable generator as determined by the ISO-NE rules, as they may change from time to time. By way of example, a contract with a one hundred (100) megawatt facility with a thirty percent (30%) capacity factor would be counted as providing thirty megawatts (30 MW) to the minimum long-term contract capacity requirement.

The electric distribution company shall, subject to review and approval of the commission, select a reasonable method of soliciting proposals from renewable energy developers, which shall include, at a minimum, an annual public solicitation, but may also include individual negotiations. The solicitation process shall permit a reasonable amount of negotiating discretion for the parties to engage in commercially reasonable, arms-length negotiations over final contract terms. Each long-term contract entered into pursuant to this section shall contain a condition that it shall not be effective without commission review and approval. The electric distribution company shall file such contract, along with a justification for its decision, within a reasonable time after it has executed the contract following a solicitation or negotiation. The commission shall hold public hearings to review the contract within forty-five (45) days of the filing and issue a written order approving or rejecting the contract within sixty (60) days of the filing; in rejecting a contract, the commission may advise the parties of the reason for the contract being rejected and direct the parties to attempt to address the reasons for rejection in a revised contract within a specified period not to exceed ninety (90) days. The commission shall approve the contract if it determines that: (1) The contract is commercially reasonable; (2) The requirements for the annual solicitation have been met; and (3) The contract is consistent with the purposes of this chapter. A report on each solicitation shall be filed with the commission each year within a reasonable time after decisions are made by the electric distribution company regarding the solicitation results, even if no contracts are executed following the solicitation.

       The general assembly finds it is in the public interest for the state to facilitate the construction of a small-scale offshore wind demonstration project off the coast of Block Island, including an undersea transmission cable that interconnects Block Island to the mainland in order to: position the state to take advantage of the economic development benefits of the emerging offshore wind industry; promote the development of renewable energy sources that increase the nation’s energy independence from foreign sources of fossil fuels; reduce the adverse environmental and health impacts of traditional fossil fuel energy sources; and provide the town of New Shoreham with an electrical connection to the mainland. To effectuate these goals, and notwithstanding any other provisions of the general or public laws to the contrary, the town of New Shoreham project, its associated power purchase agreement, transmission arrangements, and related costs are authorized pursuant to the process and standards contained in this section. The Narragansett Electric Company is hereby authorized to enter into an amended power purchase agreement with the developer of offshore wind for the purchase of energy, capacity, and any other environmental and market attributes, on terms that are consistent with the power purchase agreement that was filed with the commission on December 9, 2009, in docket 4111, and amendments changing dates and deadlines, provided that the pricing terms of such agreement are amended as more fully described in subsection (e) of this section, in addition to other amendments that are made to take into account the provisions of this section as amended since the filing of the agreement in docket 4111. Any amendments shall ensure that the pricing can only be lower, and never exceed, the original pricing included in the power purchase agreement that was reviewed in docket 4111. The demonstration project subject to the amended power purchase agreement shall include up to (but not exceeding) eight (8) wind turbines with aggregate nameplate capacity of no more than thirty megawatts (30 MW), even if the actual capacity factor of the project results in the project technically exceeding ten megawatts (10 MW).

The commission shall allow other interventions on an expedited basis, provided they comply with the commission standards for intervention. The developer shall provide funding for the economic development corporation to hire an expert experienced in power markets, renewable energy project financing, and power contracts who shall provide testimony regarding the terms and conditions of the power purchase agreement to assist the commission in its review, provided that the developer shall be precluded from influencing the choice of expert, which shall be in the sole discretion of the economic development corporation. This testimony shall be filed within twenty (20) days after the filing of the amended power purchase agreement. The parties shall have the right to respond to the testimony of this expert through oral examination at the evidentiary hearings.

       The project shall include a transmission cable between the town of New Shoreham and the mainland of the state. The electric distribution company, at its option, may elect to own, operate, or otherwise participate in such transmission cable project. The electric distribution company, however, has the option to decline to own, operate, or otherwise participate in the transmission cable project. The electric distribution company may elect to purchase the transmission cable and related facilities from the developer or an affiliate of the developer, pursuant to the terms of a transmission facility’s purchase agreement negotiated between the electric distribution company and the developer or its affiliate, an unexecuted copy of which shall be provided to the division of public utilities and carriers for the division’s consent to execution. The division shall have twenty (20) days to review the agreement. If the division independently determines that the terms and pricing of the agreement are reasonable, taking into account the intention of the legislature to advance the project as a policy-making matter, the division shall provide its written consent to the execution of the transmission facilities purchase agreement. Once written consent is provided, the electric distribution company and its transmission affiliate are authorized to make a filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to put into effect transmission rates to recover all of the costs associated with the purchase of the transmission cable and related facilities and the annual operation and maintenance. The revenue requirement for the annual cable costs shall be calculated in the same manner that the revenue requirement is calculated for other transmission facilities in Rhode Island for local network service under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The division shall be authorized to represent the state of Rhode Island in those proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, including the authority to enter into any settlement agreements on behalf of the state to implement the intention of this section. The division shall support transmission rates and conditions that allow for the costs related to the transmission cable and related facilities to be charged in transmission rates in a manner that socializes the costs throughout Rhode Island. Should the electric distribution company own, operate, and maintain the cable, the annual costs incurred by the electric distribution company, directly or through transmission charges, shall be recovered annually through a fully reconciling rate adjustment from customers of the electric distribution company and/or from the Block Island Power Company or its successor, subject to any federal approvals that may be required by law. The allocation of the costs related to the transmission cable through transmission rates or otherwise shall be structured so that the estimated impact on the typical residential customer bill for transmission costs for customers in the town of New Shoreham shall be higher than the estimated impact on the typical residential customer bill for customers on the mainland of the electric distribution company. This higher charge for the customers in the town of New Shoreham shall be developed by allocating the actual cable costs based on the annual peak demands of the Block Island Power Company and the electric distribution company, and these resultant costs recovered in the per-KWh charges of each company. In any event, the difference in the individual charge per KWh or per customer/month shall not exceed the ratio of average demand to peak demand for Block Island Power Company, relative to the electric distribution company, currently at 1.8 to 1.0 respectively. To the extent that any state tariffs or rates must be put into effect in order to implement the intention of this section, the public utilities commission shall accept filings of the same and shall approve them.

If the electric distribution company owns, operates, or otherwise participates in the transmission cable project, pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, the provisions of § 39-26.1-4 shall not apply to the cable cost portion of the town of New Shoreham project.

       Upon certification by the department of administration identifying the developer selected by the state to develop a utility-scale offshore wind farm, the developer may file an application under this section within one hundred eighty (180) days of the certification by the department. For the purposes of this section, “utility-scale offshore wind farm” shall mean a wind power project located offshore in the waters of Rhode Island or adjacent federal waters of at least 100 megawatts (100 MW) but not more than one hundred fifty megawatts (150 MW). The purpose of the application shall be for the applicant to request that the commission require a long-term contract with the electric distribution company. Should the commission approve a contract pursuant to this section, it shall not be counted towards the minimum long-term contract capacity specified in § 39-26.1-2(6).

       The commission shall hold proceedings to review the proposal contained in the application. In reviewing the application, the commission shall determine whether the proposal is in the best interests of electric distribution customers in Rhode Island. In making this determination, the commission shall consider the following factors: (i) The economic impact and potential risks, if any, of the proposal on rates to be charged by the electric distribution company; (ii) The potential benefits of stabilizing long-term energy prices; (iii) Any other factor the commission determines necessary to be in the best interest of the ratepayers.

       The commission shall issue a final order in the proceedings required by subsection (b) within eight (8) months of the filing of the application. If the commission determines that the proposal meets the standard outlined in subsection (b), the commission shall require the electric distribution company to negotiate a long-term contract with the applicant. The applicant, however, may decline to continue with the project for any reason at any time during the process outlined in this section. The commission may require changes to the applicant’s proposal as a condition to a long-term contract, as the commission determines are just and reasonable. The contract shall contain terms that are commercially reasonable. The contract also shall require that the electric distribution company purchase all of the output of the entire project, unless otherwise authorized by the commission. The parties shall present a proposed contract for review by the commission within three (3) months of the order requiring negotiations. If the parties are unable to reach agreement on a contract within three (3) months of the order requiring negotiations, the commission shall have the discretion to order the parties to arbitrate the dispute on an expedited basis. Once the contract terms are finalized by negotiation or arbitration, the contract shall be filed with the commission for review and approval. The commission shall approve the contract upon a finding that the contract is consistent with the purposes of this chapter and the standards set forth in subsection (b). The commission shall issue its final decision on the proposed contract within sixty (60) days of receiving the proposed contract. Upon execution of the contract, the provisions of §§ 39-26.1-4 and 39-26.1-5 shall apply, and all costs incurred in the negotiation, administration, enforcement, and implementation of the agreement shall be recovered annually by the electric distribution company in electric distribution rates. To the extent the application cites significant economic benefits to Rhode Island that require commitments from the applicant outside of the long-term contract to achieve such benefits, and those economic benefits are ultimately relied upon by the commission in authorizing a long-term contract to be negotiated, the commission may require that appropriate legally binding commitments be made by the applicant as a condition to a long-term contract, unless the commission finds that such commitments are not necessary.

       Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the application process does not convey a legal entitlement to the applicant to a long-term contract. Rather, the purpose of the proceeding is to leave the final decision as to whether a long-term contract should be required to the discretion of the commission, subject to the standards outlined in this section and the purposes of this chapter.

       An applicant under this section shall not be permitted to submit a proposal under the solicitations required in § 39-26.1-3, except that such applicant shall be permitted to submit a proposal under § 39-26.1-7.

       Should a proceeding pursuant to this section result in the commission not ordering the distribution company to enter into a long-term contract for a utility-scale offshore wind project, or should the certified developer fail to file an application with the commission within one hundred eighty (180) days of certification, the certification shall be deemed void. In such case, if the commission determines it is in the interest of electric distribution customers to have another utility-scale project considered for a long-term contract, the commission has the discretion to request the department of administration to certify a different developer to make another proposal for a utility-scale offshore wind project per this section, provided that the commission makes such request within ninety (90) days of the certification becoming void. If the commission makes the request, the department of administration may, but is not required to, certify another project and shall have ninety days to submit another certification. If the certification is not made within the time allowed, no further action shall be taken by the commission pursuant to this section. Under no circumstances is a distribution company required to enter into more than one contract under this section.

       Approval of a contract under this section shall not be interpreted to prevent, hinder, or diminish the ability of any offshore wind project or developer to pursue, finance, seek the development of, or secure permits or electrical interconnection for offshore wind projects in or adjacent to the state, or whose output may be utilized in the state.

       Within a period of time sufficient to accomplish the purposes of this section, but not longer than ninety (90) days after the effective date of this chapter, the board shall set ceiling prices and annual targets for each renewable energy class of distributed generation for the 2011 program year and make a filing with the commission pursuant to this chapter recommending such prices and targets. Thereafter annually, by no later than October 15 of each year, the board shall make filings with the commission to recommend the standard contract ceiling prices and annual targets for each renewable energy class of distributed-generation facility. The ceiling price for each technology should be a price that would allow a private owner to invest in a given project at a reasonable rate of return, based on recent reported and forecast information on the cost of capital, and the cost of generation equipment. The calculation of the reasonable rate of return for a project shall include where applicable any state or federal incentives including, but not limited to, tax incentives. In setting the ceiling prices, the board also may consider: (1) Transactions for newly developed renewable energy resources, by technology and size, in the ISO-NE region and the northeast corridor; (2) Pricing for standard contracts received during the previous program year; (3) Environmental benefits, including, but not limited to, reducing carbon emissions, and system benefits; and (4) Cost-effectiveness. The board shall, in performing this assessment, involve representation from its advisory council, if applicable, and from the office of energy resources, the electric distribution company, and the energy efficiency and resources management council. The board shall hold, with at least ten (10) business days’ notice, a public community review meeting. The board shall issue a report of its findings from the assessment process recommending standard contract ceiling prices for the upcoming program year.

       Each electric distribution company shall conduct at least three (3) standard contract enrollments during each program year; however, during 2011, the electric distribution company need only conduct one enrollment. Each enrollment shall be open for a two-week (2) period during which the electric distribution company is required to receive standard short-form applications requesting standard contracts for distributed-generation energy projects. The short-form applications shall require the applicant to provide the project owner’s identity and the project’s proposed location, nameplate capacity, and renewable energy class and allow for additional information relative to the permitting, financial feasibility, ability to build, and timing for deployment of the proposed projects. For small distributed-generation projects, the applicant must submit an affidavit confirming that the project is not a segment of a larger project being planned for enlargement over time. For large distributed-generation projects, the short-form application shall also require the applicant to bid a bundled price for the sale of the energy, capacity, renewable energy certificates, and all other environmental attributes and market products that are available or may become available from the distributed-generation facility, on a per-kilowatt-hour basis for the output of the project. Subject to the provisions of subsections (b) and (c), the electric distribution company shall not be required to enter into standard contracts in excess of the annual target for the applicable program year and shall not be required to enter into standard contracts in excess of any limit set by the board and approved by the commission for a given enrollment. However, the electric distribution company may voluntarily exceed an enrollment period limit as long as it does not exceed an annual target for the applicable program year.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c26.2s39-26.2-6ol1b">
       For small distributed-generation projects, the electric distribution company shall select projects for standard contracts based on the lowest proposal prices received with any distributed-generation project that meets the requirements of all applicable tariffs and regulations, and meets the criteria of a renewable energy class in effect, until the class target is met. Enrollment periods will be governed by a solicitation and enrollment process rules that shall be filed with the commission each October 15 by the electric distribution company, and approved by the commission within sixty (60) days of such filing.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c26.2s39-26.2-6ol1c">
       For large distributed-generation projects, the electric distribution company shall select projects for standard contracts based on the lowest proposed prices received, but not to exceed the applicable standard contract ceiling price, provided, that the selected projects meet the requirements of all applicable tariffs and regulations and meet the criteria of a renewable energy class in effect until the class target is met. Except for 2011, no enrollment period shall seek to enroll more than one-third (1/3) of the annual goal for the distribution company for large distributed-generation projects.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c26.2s39-26.2-6ol1d">
       If there are more projects than what is specified for a class target at the same price, the electric distribution company shall review the applications submitted and select first those projects that appear to be the furthest along in development and likely to be deployed in consultation with the office. Those projects that are likely to be deployed on the earliest timelines shall be selected. To the extent the electric distribution company is unable to make a clear distinction on this basis, the electric company shall report the results to the board and not enter into contracts with those projects that are tied on pricing. In such case, the board may take such action as it deems appropriate for the selection of projects, including seeking more information from the projects. Alternatively, the board may consider adjustments to the ceiling price and a rebid, or simply wait until the next enrollment.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c26.2s39-26.2-6ol1e">
       Should an electric distribution company determine that it has entered into sufficient standard contracts to achieve a program-year class target, it shall immediately report this to the board, the office of energy resources, and the commission, and cease entering into standard contracts for that renewable energy class for the remainder of the program year. An electric distribution company may exceed the renewable energy class target if the last standard contract entered into may cause the total purchased to exceed the target. The office and the electric distribution company shall enter into a memorandum of understanding regarding the sharing of the information and data related to the distributed-generation program.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c26.2s39-26.2-6ol1f">
       The electric distribution company is authorized to enter into standard contracts up to the applicable ceiling price. As long as the terms of the standard contract are materially the same as the standard contract terms approved by the commission and the pricing is no higher than the applicable ceiling price, the contracts shall be deemed prudent and approved by the commission for purposes of recovering the costs in rates.

       A distributed-generation project that also is being employed by a customer for net-metering purposes may submit an application to sell the excess output from its distributed-generation project. In such case, however, at the election of the self-generator, all of the renewable energy certificates and environmental attributes pertaining to the energy consumed on site may be sold to the electric distribution company on a month-to-month basis outside of the terms of the standard contract. In such case, the portion of the renewable energy certificates that pertains to the energy consumed on site during the net-metering billing period shall be priced at the average market price of renewable energy certificates, which may be determined by using the price of renewable energy certificates purchased or sold by the electric distribution company.

     <ol>
      <li id="t39c26.2s39-26.2-7ol11">
       A working group (“contract working group”) shall be established and supervised by the board, consisting of the following members: (i) The director of the office of energy resources; (ii) A designee from the division of public utilities and carriers; (iii) Two (2) designees of the electric distribution company; (iv) Two (2) individuals designated by the office of energy resources who are experienced developers of renewable-generation projects; (v) One individual designated by the office of energy resources who represents a customer of the electric distribution company; and (vi) A lawyer designated by the office of energy resources who has at least three (3) years of experience in negotiating and/or developing power-purchase agreements. With respect to the lawyer designated in (vi), the electric distribution company shall enter into a cost-reimbursement agreement with the lawyer, to compensate the lawyer for the time spent serving in the contract working group at the reasonable hourly rate negotiated by the office of energy resources. The costs incurred by the electric distribution company under the reimbursement agreement shall be recovered in rates by the electric distribution company in the year incurred or the year following incurrence through an appropriate filing with the commission. The contract working group shall be an advisory group that is not to be considered to be an agency for purposes of the administrative procedures act or any other laws pertaining to public bodies.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c26.2s39-26.2-7ol12">
       The contract working group shall work in good faith to develop standard contracts that would be applicable for various technologies for both small and large distributed-generation projects. The standard contracts should balance the need for the project to obtain financing against the need for the distribution company to protect itself and its distribution customers against unreasonable risks. The standard contract should be developed from contracting terms typically utilized in the wholesale power industry, taking into account the size of each project and the technology. The standard contracts shall provide for the purchase of energy, capacity, renewable energy certificates, and all other environmental attributes and market products that are available, or may become available from the distributed-generation facility. However, the electric distribution company shall retain the right to separate out pricing for each market product under the contracts for administrative and accounting purposes to avoid any detrimental accounting effects or for administrative convenience, provided that such accounting, as specified in the contract, does not affect the price and financial benefits to the seller as a seller of a bundled product. The standard contract also shall:
       <ol type="i">
        <li id="t39c26.2s39-26.2-7ol12-i">
         Hold the distributed-generation facility owner liable for the cost of interconnection from the electric-distribution facility to the interconnect point with the distribution system, and for any upgrades to the existing electric-distribution system that may be required by the electric distribution company. However, a distributed-generation facility owner may appeal to the commission to reduce any required system upgrade costs to the extent such upgrades can be shown to benefit other customers of the electric distribution company and the balance of such costs shall be included in rates by the electric distribution company for recovery in the year incurred or the year following incurrence;
        </li>
        <li id="t39c26.2s39-26.2-7ol12-ii">
         Require the distributed-generation facility owner to make a performance guarantee deposit to the electric distribution company of fifteen dollars ($15.00) for small distributed-generation projects or twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for large distributed-generation projects for every renewable energy certificate estimated to be generated per year under the contract, but at least five hundred dollars ($500), and not more than seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000), paid at the time of contract execution;

         Provide that if the distributed-generation facility has not generated ninety percent (90%) of the output proposed in its enrollment application within eighteen (18) months after execution of the contract, the contract shall be terminated and the performance guarantee shall be forfeited. An eligible, small-scale, hydropower-distributed-generation facility that has not generated ninety percent (90%) of the output proposed in its enrollment application within forty-eight (48) months after execution of the contract shall result in the contract being terminated and the performance guarantee being forfeited. An eligible anaerobic-digestion-distributed-generation facility that has not generated ninety percent (90%) of the output proposed in its enrollment application within thirty-six (36) months after execution of the contract shall result in the contract being terminated and the performance guarantee being forfeited. Any forfeited performance-guarantee deposits shall be credited to all distribution customers in rates and not retained by the electric distribution company;

        <li id="t39c26.2s39-26.2-7ol12-v">
         Provide for flexible payment schedules that may be negotiated between the buyer and seller, but shall be no longer than quarterly if an agreement cannot be reached;

        <li id="t39c26.2s39-26.2-7ol12-vi">
         Require that an electric meter that conforms with standard industry norms be installed to measure the electrical energy output of the distributed-generation facility, and require a system or procedure by which the distributed-generation facility owner shall demonstrate creation of renewable energy credits, in a manner recognized and accounted for by the GIS; such demonstration of renewable energy credit creation to be at the distributed-generation facility owner’s expense. The electric distribution company may, at its discretion, offer to provide such a renewable energy credit measurement and accounting system or procedure to the distributed-generation facility owner, and the distributed-generation facility owner may, at its discretion, use the electric distribution company’s program, or use that of an independent third party, approved by the commission, and the costs of the measurement and accounting are paid for by the distributed-generation facility owner.

        <li id="t39c26.2s39-26.2-7ol12-vii">
         All distributed-generation projects that have executed contracts will be required to submit quarterly reports on the progress of the project to the distribution company and the office of energy resources. Failure to submit these quarterly progress reports may result in the termination of the contract.

      <li id="t39c26.2s39-26.2-7ol13">
       If the contract working group reaches agreement on the terms of standard contracts, the board shall file the contracts with the commission for approval. If there are any disagreements, they shall be identified to the commission. The commission shall review the standard contracts for conformance with the standards set forth in subsection (2). Should there be any disputes, the commission shall issue an order resolving them. To the extent the commission needs expert assistance to resolve any disagreements noted in the filing, the commission is authorized to hire a consultant to assist it in the proceedings, the costs of which shall be recovered from electric distribution customers pursuant to a uniform factor established by the commission in rates for recovery by the electric distribution company in the year incurred or the year following incurrence, as requested through a filing by the electric distribution company. The commission shall issue an order approving standard forms of contract within sixty (60) days of the filing.

     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t39c26.3s39-26.3-2ol11">
       “Applicant” means an electric distribution customer or distributed-generation developer who submits an application to the electric distribution company for the installation of a renewable distributed-generation interconnection to the distribution system for a renewable distributed-generation project that, as contemplated, meets the eligibility requirements for net metering contained within this title or the eligibility requirements for a standard contract contained within this title.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c26.3s39-26.3-2ol12">
       “Feasibility study” means a high-level project assessment that includes an estimate of the cost of interconnecting to the distribution system that would be assessed on the applicant for an interconnection. The estimate is not based on any engineering study, but is based on past experience and judgment of the electric distribution company, taking into account the information in the application, the location of the interconnection, and general knowledge of the distribution and transmission system. The estimate cannot be relied upon by the applicant for purposes of holding the electric distribution company liable or responsible for its accuracy as long as the electric distribution company has provided the estimate in good faith. The feasibility study estimate shall be a range within which the electric distribution company believes the interconnection costs are likely to be and shall include a disclaimer that explains the nature of the estimate.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c26.3s39-26.3-2ol13">
       “Feasibility study fee” means a fee that shall be charged to the applicant to obtain a feasibility study as specified in § 39-26.3-4.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c26.3s39-26.3-2ol14">
       “Impact study” means an engineering study that includes an estimate of the cost of interconnecting to the distribution system that would be assessed on the applicant for an interconnection that is based on an engineering study of the details of the proposed generation project. The estimate generally will have a probability of accuracy of plus or minus twenty-five percent (25%). The estimate may be relied upon by the applicant for purposes of determining the expected cost of interconnection, but the distribution company may not be held liable or responsible if the actual costs exceed the estimate as long as the estimate was provided in good faith and the interconnection was implemented prudently by the electric distribution company.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c26.3s39-26.3-2ol15">
       “Impact study fee” means a fee that shall be charged to the applicant to obtain an impact study as specified in § 39-26.3-4.

       An applicant for a renewable distributed-generation interconnection must submit an application to the electric distribution company for an impact study, including a request for an estimate of the cost of interconnecting the renewable distributed-generation resource to the distribution system. The applicant may request a feasibility study prior to requesting an impact study, but the applicant is not required to do so and may submit an application for an impact study without having obtained a feasibility study. The distribution company shall follow the schedule below for all applications.

       In anticipation of the electric distribution company needing to add resources that are not currently in Rhode Island or covered in rates, to provide the necessary services to advance the aggressive goals and objectives set forth in this title, the electric distribution company shall be authorized to add up to two (2) incremental employee resources located in Rhode Island that shall be primarily dedicated to servicing Rhode Island applicants and customers in connection with net metering and the development of distributed-generation resources, including the requisite resources to perform impact and feasibility studies for distributed-generation interconnections and to assure that feasibility studies and impact studies, as well as other engineering activity necessary to facilitate the completion of distributed-generation projects in Rhode Island, are implemented and delivered on a timely basis. Prior to new rates going into effect following the company’s next general rate case filing, the cost of the incremental employee resources shall be recovered through rates on an annual basis through an annual reconciliation mechanism, provided that the total amount of fees collected from impact studies and feasibility studies shall be netted against such costs. Only the cost of time and work actually spent on Rhode Island renewable energy project matters shall be included in the annual reconciliation. The commission shall have the authority to review these positions in the electric distribution company’s next general rate case as a cost of service in the same manner as it reviews all other expenses in a rate case to determine whether they should continue. Nothing contained in this section shall preclude the electric distribution company from adding additional resources, subject to commission approval.

       An electric distribution company shall acknowledge to the interconnecting, renewable energy customer receipt of an application to initiate the interconnection process within three (3) business days of receipt. The electric distribution company shall notify the interconnecting, renewable energy customer in writing within ten (10) business days of receipt that the application is or is not complete and, if not, advise what is missing. Any disputes regarding whether and when an application to initiate the interconnection process is complete shall be resolved expeditiously at the public utilities commission. The maximum time allowed between the date of the completed application and delivery of an executable interconnection service agreement shall be one hundred seventy-five (175) calendar days or two hundred (200) calendar days if a detailed study is required. All electric distribution company system modifications must be completed by the date which is the later of: (1) No longer than two hundred seventy (270) calendar days, or three hundred sixty (360) calendar days if substation work is necessary, from the date of the electric distribution company’s receipt of the interconnecting, renewable energy customer’s executed interconnection service agreement; or (2) The interconnecting, renewable energy customer’s agreed-upon extension of the time between the execution of the interconnection service agreement and interconnection as set forth in writing. All deadlines herein are subject to all payments being made in accordance with the distributed-generation interconnection tariff on file with the public utilities commission and the interconnection service agreement. These system modification deadlines cannot be extended due to customer delays in providing required information, all of which must be requested and obtained before completion of the impact study. The deadlines for completion of system modifications will be extended only to the extent of events that are clearly not under the control of the electric distribution company, such as extended prohibitive weather, union work stoppage or force majeure, or third-party delays, including, without limitation, delays due to ISO-NE requirements not attributable to electric distribution company actions, and that cannot be resolved despite commercially reasonable efforts. The electric distribution company shall notify the customer of the start of any claimed deadline extension as soon as practicable, its cause and when it concludes, all in writing. Any actual damages that a court of competent jurisdiction orders the electric distribution company to pay to an interconnecting, renewable energy customer as a direct result of the electric distribution company’s failure to comply with the requirements of this subsection shall be payable by its shareholders and may not be recovered from customers, provided that the total amount of damages awarded for any and all such claims shall not exceed, in the aggregate, an amount equal to the amount of the incentive the electric distribution company would have earned as provided for in §§ 39-26.6-12(j)(3) and 39-26.1-4 in the year in which the system modifications were required to be completed.

Except for an eligible net-metering system owned by or operated on behalf of a public entity, educational institution, hospital, nonprofit, or multi-municipal collaborative through a net-metering financing arrangement, the purpose of this definition is to reasonably assure that energy generated by the eligible net-metering system is consumed by net-metered electric service account(s) that are actually located in the same geographical location as the eligible net-metering system. All energy generated from any eligible net-metering system is, and will be considered, consumed at the meter where the renewable energy resource is interconnected for valuation purposes. Except for an eligible net-metering system owned by, or operated on behalf of, a public entity, educational institution, hospital, nonprofit, or multi-municipal collaborative through a net-metering financing arrangement, or except for a community remote net-metering system, all of the net-metered accounts at the eligible net-metering system site must be the accounts of the same customer of record and customers are not permitted to enter into agreements or arrangements to change the name on accounts for the purpose of artificially expanding the eligible net-metering system site to contiguous sites in an attempt to avoid this restriction. However, a property owner may change the nature of the metered service at the accounts at the site to be master metered in the owner’s name, or become the customer of record for each of the accounts, provided that the owner becoming the customer of record actually owns the property at which the account is located. As long as the net-metered accounts meet the requirements set forth in this definition, there is no limit on the number of accounts that may be net metered within the eligible net-metering system site.

After December 31, 2018, the commission may expand or modify the aggregate amount after a public hearing upon petition by the office of energy resources. The commission shall determine within six (6) months of such petition being docketed by the commission whether the benefits of the proposed expansion exceed the cost. This aggregate amount shall not apply to any net-metering financing arrangement involving public entity facilities, multi-municipal collaborative facilities, educational institutions, the federal government, hospitals, or nonprofits.

The billing plan would be designed to even out monthly billings over twelve (12) months, regardless of actual production and usage. If such election is made by the electric distribution company, the electric distribution company would reconcile payments and credits under the billing plan to actual production and consumption at the end of the twelve-month (12) period and apply any credits or charges to the net-metered accounts for any positive or negative difference, as applicable. Should there be a material change in circumstances at the eligible net-metering system site or associated accounts during the twelve-month (12) period, the estimates and credits may be adjusted by the electric distribution company during the reconciliation period. The electric distribution company also may elect (but is not required) to issue checks to any net-metering customer in lieu of billing credits or carry-forward credits or charges to the next billing period. For residential-eligible net-metering systems and community remote net-metering systems twenty-five kilowatts (25 KW) or smaller, the electric distribution company, at its option, may administer renewable net-metering credits month to month allowing unused credits to carry forward into the following billing period.

       Investing in energy efficiency and renewable energy improvements is financially beneficial over time, as well as good for the environment;

       Property-Assessed Clean Energy, hereinafter referred to as PACE, is a voluntary financing mechanism that allows both residential and commercial property owners to access affordable, long-term financing for renewable energy and energy-efficiency upgrades including, but not limited to, system-reliability upgrades, alternative fuel infrastructure upgrades, and other eligible environmental health and environmental safety upgrades on their property;

       PACE financing offers incremental, special-assessment payments that are low and fixed for up to twenty (20) years, with no upfront costs; the PACE special-assessment fees transfer to the new owner when a property is sold, or the assessment obligation can be paid in full at transfer; and electricity and fuel bills are lower than they would be without the improvements; and

       The Rhode Island infrastructure bank or a third-party capital provider may enter into a financing agreement with a qualifying PACE property owner. After such agreement is entered into, and upon notice from the Rhode Island infrastructure bank, the PACE municipality shall: (i) Place a caveat on the land records indicating that a PACE assessment and lien is anticipated upon completion of the PACE project for such property; or (ii) At the direction of the Rhode Island infrastructure bank, levy the PACE assessment and file a lien on the land records on the estimated costs of the PACE project prior to the completion or upon the completion of said PACE project.

       PACE assessments levied pursuant to this chapter and the interest, fees, and any penalties thereon shall constitute a lien against the qualifying PACE property on which they are made until they are paid. The lien shall be collected in the same manner as the property taxes of the PACE municipality on real property, including, in the event of default or delinquency, with respect to any penalties, fees, and remedies. Each lien may be recorded and released in the manner provided for property tax liens and if the property is commercial property as defined herein, it shall be subject to the consent of existing mortgage holders. The PACE lien shall take precedence over all other liens or encumbrances except a lien for taxes of the municipality on real property, or if the subject property is residential property as defined herein, the PACE lien shall be subject to any prior recorded mortgage which lien for taxes or pre-recorded residential mortgage shall have priority over the PACE-assessment lien. To the extent PACE assessments are paid in installments and any such installment is not paid when due, the PACE-assessment lien may be foreclosed to the extent of any unpaid installment payments and any penalties, interest, and fees related thereto. In the event the PACE-assessment lien is foreclosed, the PACE-assessment lien shall survive the judgment of foreclosure to the extent of any unpaid installment payments of the PACE assessment secured by the PACE-assessment lien that were not the subject of such judgment.

The Rhode Island infrastructure bank may sell or assign, for consideration, any and all liens received from the participating municipality. The consideration received by the Rhode Island infrastructure bank shall be negotiated between the Rhode Island infrastructure bank and the assignee. The assignee or assignees of the liens shall have and possess the same powers and rights at law or in equity as the Rhode Island infrastructure bank and the participating municipality and its tax collector would have had if the lien had not been assigned with regard to the precedence and priority of the lien, the accrual of interest, and the fees and expenses of collection. The assignee shall have the same rights to enforce the liens as any private party holding a lien on real property, including, but not limited to, foreclosure and a suit on the debt. Costs and reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by the assignee as a result of any foreclosure action or other legal proceeding brought pursuant to this section and directly related to the proceeding shall be taxed in the proceeding against each person having title to any property subject to the proceedings. The costs and fees may be collected by the assignee at any time after demand for payment has been made by the assignee.

       Each year, for a period of at least five (5) program years, the electric distribution company shall file tariffs with the commission that are designed to provide a multiyear stream of performance-based incentives to eligible renewable-distributed-generation projects for a term of years, under terms and conditions set forth in the tariffs and approved by the commission. The tariffs shall set forth the rights and obligations of the owner of the distributed-generation project and the conditions upon which payment of performance-based incentives by the electric distribution company will be paid. The tariffs shall include the non-price conditions set forth in §§ 39-26.2-7(2)(i) — (vii) for small distributed-generation projects (other than small- and medium-scale solar) and large distributed-generation projects; provided, however, that the time periods for the projects to reach ninety percent (90%) of output shall be extended to twenty-four (24) months (other than eligible anaerobic-digestion projects, which shall be thirty-six (36) months, and eligible small-scale hydro, which shall be forty-eight (48) months).

The proposed tariffs shall include the ceiling prices and term lengths for each tariff that are recommended by the board. The term lengths shall be from fifteen (15) to twenty (20) years; provided, however, that the board may recommend shorter terms for small-scale solar projects. Whatever term lengths between fifteen (15) and twenty (20) years are chosen for any given tariff, the evaluation of the bids for that tariff shall be done on a consistent basis such that the same term lengths for competing bids are used to determine the winning bids.

     </h3>
     <p>
      It is the intention of the general assembly in enacting this chapter that the developers, owners, investors, customers, and lenders of the distributed-generation projects receiving performance-based incentives under the tariffs be able to rely on the tariffs for the entire term of the applicable tariff for purposes of obtaining financing. Consistent with that intention and expectation, the terms under the tariffs for a given program year, once approved by the commission, shall not be altered in any way that would undermine such reliance on those tariffs during the applicable terms of the tariffs; and in no circumstance will the performance-based incentive rate paid to a renewable energy project developer or owner be reduced during the term of the tariff once a renewable energy project has qualified to receive a tariff under the terms of this chapter.

The enrollment MW targets shall be recommended by the board each year, subject to commission approval. The board shall also recommend a megawatt target for each class (“class MW target”) that comprises a specified portion of the enrollment MW target, subject to commission approval. If the electric distribution company, the office, and the board mutually agree, they may reallocate megawatts during an enrollment from one class to another without commission approval if there is an over-subscription in one class and an under-subscription in another, provided that the annual MW target is not being exceeded, except as provided in § 39-26.6-7.

       The renewable energy growth program is intended to achieve at least an aggregate amount of one hundred sixty nameplate megawatts (160 MW) over five (5) years, plus any shortfall amount added in pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. However, after the second program year, the board may, based on market data and other information available to it, including pricing received during previous program years, recommend changes to the annual target for any program year above or below the specified targets in subsection (c) of this section if the board concludes that market conditions are likely to produce favorably low or unfavorably high target pricing during the upcoming program year, provided that the recommendation may not result in the five-year (5), one-hundred-sixty-megawatt-nameplate (160 MW) target, plus any shortfall added pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, being exceeded. Any megawatt reduction in an annual target shall be added to the target in the fifth year of the program (and any subsequent years if necessary) such that the overall program target of one-hundred-sixty-megawatt-nameplate (160 MW) capacity, plus any shortfall added pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, is achieved. In considering these issues, the board and the commission may take into account the reasonableness of current pricing and its impact on all electric distribution customers and the legislative purpose of this chapter as set forth herein, including the program purpose to facilitate the development of renewable distributed generation in the load zone of the electric distribution company at reasonable cost.

       Except for the first program year, the board shall determine, subject to commission approval, the standard performance-based incentive for small- and medium-sized solar projects from the average bid price from the last two (2) procurement enrollments conducted in the commercial-scale and/or large-scale solar projects class. For the first program year, the board may derive the standard performance incentive for small- and medium-sized solar projects from the bidding data obtained from the distributed-generation program in effect in 2014 under the provisions of chapter 26.2 of this title until there is bidding data from the first procurement under the new program which shall then be used to set a new standard performance incentive. The standard performance incentive may be set at a higher rate than payments for commercial-scale and large-scale solar projects in order to take into account the potentially higher per-unit cost of smaller projects. The standard performance incentive also shall be adjusted upward or downward, as needed, in order to take into account the term length over which the incentive shall be paid for the small- and medium-scale solar projects if such terms are different than the terms applicable to the classes from which the standard performance incentive was derived.

       For each program year, the board shall recommend to the commission a standard performance incentive for each of the small-scale and medium-scale solar project classifications. Upon receiving the recommendations from the board, the commission shall open a docket to consider the recommendations or address the recommendations in its approval process for the program year in a consolidated docket as provided in § 39-26.6-10. The commission shall issue its order approving the recommendations no later than concurrently with approval of the entire program and tariffs applicable to the program year; provided, however, that the commission may make modifications or changes to the board’s recommendations consistent with the legislative purposes of this chapter.

      <li id="t39c26.6s39-26.6-15ol1d">
       If after the first program year, the applications for the medium-scale solar projects are significantly over-subscribed, then the board and the electric distribution company, in consultation with the office, may propose to the commission a bidding process for medium-scale projects or a subset of the medium-scale projects under which project selections would be made based on the lowest bids, rather than first-come, first-served or such other method previously approved by the commission. The commission shall approve the proposal from the board and electric company within ninety (90) days; provided, however, that the commission may make changes to the proposal consistent with the legislative purposes of this chapter.

       The commission shall approve the bidding process for medium-scale solar projects recommended by the board only if the commission finds that such bidding process is in a sufficiently simple form that is not administratively burdensome to bidders, and will not have the effect of discouraging participation in the distributed-generation growth program by developers of medium-scale solar projects that may be unrepresented by counsel.

Those projects that are likely to be deployed at the earliest time shall be selected first. To the extent the electric distribution company is unable to make a clear distinction on this basis, the electric distribution company shall report its findings to the board and not award bids for those projects that are tied on pricing. In that case, the board may take such action as it deems appropriate for the selection of projects, including seeking more information from the projects.

In this case, the electric distribution company will propose criteria for eligibility for performance-based incentives for solar that require certain energy-efficiency standards be met at the customer location in order to be eligible for performance-based incentives for a small-scale and/or medium-scale solar installation.
      </li>

       The allocation of megawatts is for implementation purposes only and shall not authorize funds to be shifted from the distributed-generation growth program to energy-efficiency programs, nor will implementation of the electric distribution company’s request cause a reduction of the annual or cumulative capacity goals established for the distributed-generation growth program. To the extent that the megawatts allocated to the energy-efficiency program pursuant to this section are not committed during a program year, such uncommitted megawatts shall be allocated back to the distributed-generation growth program in the following year or such year the board recommends to the commission.

      In order to provide the electric distribution company with the flexibility to encourage distributed-generation projects to be located in designated geographical areas within its load zone where there is an identifiable system benefit, reliability benefit, or cost savings to the distribution system in that geographical area, the electric distribution company, in consultation with the board and the office, may propose to include an incentive-payment adder to the bid price of any winning bidder that proposes a distributed-generation project in the desired geographical area. The electric distribution company also may propose other incentive payments to achieve other technical or public policy objectives that provide identifiable benefits to customers. Any incentive-payment adders must be approved by the commission, and shall not be counted as part of the bid price when the bids are selected at an enrollment event.

       On or after July 1, 2015, the commission shall open a docket to consider rate design and distribution cost allocation among rate classes in light of net metering and the changing distribution system that is expected to include more distributed-energy resources, including, but not limited to, distributed generation. The commission will determine the appropriate cost responsibility and contributions to the operation, maintenance, and investment in the distribution system that is relied upon by all customers, including, without limitation, non-net-metered and net-metered customers. In that docket, the commission shall require the electric distribution company to file a revenue-neutral allocated-cost-of-service study for all rate classes and a proposal for new rates for all customers in each rate class. The electric distribution company shall use the distribution-revenue requirement upon which the then-current distribution rates were set. The electric distribution company may use the allocated cost of service that was filed with the compliance filing from the rate case when the then-current distribution rates were set. The commission may also address the rate design for the equitable recovery of costs associated with energy efficiency and any renewable energy programs that are recovered in rates.

Any new rates shall take effect for usage on and after April 1, 2016; provided, however, that the electric distribution company may seek an extension if necessary to make the billing system changes necessary to implement a new rate structure. After new, revenue-neutral rates are set in the docket specified above, the commission may approve changes to the rate design in any future distribution-base-rate cases when a fully allocated embedded cost-of-service study is being reviewed in the rate case, subject to the principles set forth in subsection (b) of this section.

      The legislature finds that:
     </p>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t39c27s39-27-2ol1a">
       Efficiency standards for certain products sold or installed in the state assure consumers and businesses that such products meet minimum efficiency performance levels, thus saving money on utility bills.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c27s39-27-2ol1b">
       The efficiency standards save energy and thus reduce pollution and other environmental impacts associated with the production, distribution, and use of electricity and natural gas.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c27s39-27-2ol1c">
       The efficiency standards can make electricity systems more reliable by reducing the strain on the electricity grid during peak demand periods. Furthermore, improved energy efficiency can reduce or delay the need for new power plants, power-transmission lines, and power-distribution system upgrades.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c27s39-27-2ol1d">
       Energy efficiency standards contribute to the economy of this state by helping to better balance energy supply and demand, thus reducing pressure for higher natural gas and electricity prices. By saving consumers and businesses money on energy bills, efficiency standards help the state and local economy, since energy bill savings can be spent on local goods and services.

       “(1) Efficiency standards for certain products sold or installed in the state assure consumers and businesses that such products meet minimum efficiency performance levels, thus reducing energy and water waste and saving consumers and businesses money on utility bills.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2) Such efficiency standards save energy and thus reduce climate-changing emissions and other environmental impacts associated with the production, distribution, and use of electricity, natural gas, and other fuels.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(3) Such efficiency standards save water, mitigating the effects of short- and long-term droughts and helping to conserve fresh water supplies.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(4) Bill savings resulting from more efficient products benefit all consumers but are especially important to low-income families, who spend a disproportionate share of their income on utilities. Efficiency standards also help the state and local economies because bill savings can be spent on local goods and services.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(5) Energy and water savings help reduce or delay the need for expensive investments in new power plants, transmission lines, and distribution system upgrades, new and expanded gas pipelines, and water and sewer infrastructure improvements.”

       “The general assembly finds that:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(1) Efficiency standards for certain products sold or installed in the state assure consumers and businesses that such products meet minimum efficiency performance levels, thus reducing energy and water waste and saving consumers and businesses money on utility bills.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(2) Such efficiency standards save energy and thus reduce climate-changing emissions and other environmental impacts associated with the production, distribution, and use of electricity, natural gas, and other fuels.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(3) Such efficiency standards save water, mitigating the effects of short- and long-term droughts and helping to conserve fresh water supplies.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(4) Bill savings resulting from more efficient products benefit all consumers but are especially important to low-income families, who spend a disproportionate share of their income on utilities. Efficiency standards also help the state and local economies because bill savings can be spent on local goods and services.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(5) Energy and water savings help reduce or delay the need for expensive investments in new power plants, transmission lines, and distribution system upgrades, new and expanded gas pipelines, and water and sewer infrastructure improvements.”

     <p>
      The Rhode Island general assembly finds that growth and enhancement of services using internet protocol technology provide Rhode Island consumers more choice in voice, data, and video services than at any other time. The proliferation of new technologies and applications and the growing number of providers developing and offering innovative services using internet protocol are due in large part to little barrier to investment, including freedom from state laws and regulations governing traditional telephone service, that these technologies have enjoyed in Rhode Island, as well as recognition that federal law is more uniform in its oversight of internet protocol-enabled services. The economic benefits, including consumer choice, new jobs, and significant capital investment, will be jeopardized and competition minimized by the imposition of traditional state entry, rate, and service-term regulation on voice over internet protocol service and internet protocol-enabled service.

       Any city or town receiving streetlighting service from an electric distribution company pursuant to an electric-rate tariff providing for the use by such municipality of lighting equipment owned by the electric distribution company, at its option, upon sixty (60) days’ notice to the electric company and to the office, and subject to the provisions of subsections (b) through (e), may:
       <ol>

         Convert its streetlighting service from the subject tariff rate to an alternative tariff rate providing for delivery service by the electric distribution company of electric energy, whether or not supplied by the electric distribution company, over distribution facilities and wires owned by the electric distribution company to lighting equipment owned or leased by the municipality, and further providing for the use by the municipality of the space on any pole, lamp post, or other mounting surface previously used by the electric distribution company for the mounting of the lighting equipment. The alternative tariff rate shall provide for monthly bills for street and area lighting that shall include a schedule of energy charges based on a determination of annual kilowatt-hour usage per-lumen rating or nominal wattage of all types of lighting equipment, but shall not include facility, support, maintenance, or accessory charges. The new tariff shall use existing usage calculation methods and existing rates for any currently existing lighting equipment, only setting reasonable new rates for newly adopted lighting equipment. The new tariff shall be structured so as to allow options for various streetlighting controls, including both conventional dusk/dawn operation using photocell or scheduling controls, as well as schedule-based dimming or on/off controls that dim or turn off streetlights during periods of low activity. The electric distribution company, in consultation with the office, shall file the new tariff with the public utilities commission within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this chapter and the commission shall then issue a decision within sixty (60) days after the filing to effectuate the purposes and provisions of this chapter;

Upon such payment, the municipality shall have the right to use, alter, remove, or replace the acquired lighting equipment in any way the municipality deems appropriate. Any contract a municipality enters for the services must require appropriate levels of training and certification of personnel providing pole service for public and worker safety, evidence of twenty-four-hour (24) call capacity, and a committed timely response schedule for both emergency and routine outages. The municipality may also request that the electric company remove any part of such lighting equipment that it does not acquire from the electric distribution company in which case the municipality shall reimburse the electric distribution company the cost of removal by the electric distribution company, along with the original cost, less depreciation, of the removed part, net of any salvage value.

     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t39c31s39-31-1ol11">
       The state and New England face significant short- and long-term energy system challenges that may undermine the reliable operation of the bulk electric system and spur unsustainable levels of price volatility, and that these challenges may have a substantial impact on energy affordability for ratepayers and undermine the economic competitiveness of our state by serving as a detriment to capital investment and job growth; and
      </li>
      <li id="t39c31s39-31-1ol12">
       Planned retirements of fossil-fuel, nuclear, and other electric generators, along with lack of new interstate natural-gas-pipeline infrastructure and capacity into the region, may exacerbate these conditions; and
      </li>
      <li id="t39c31s39-31-1ol13">
       Rhode Island benefits from a holistic energy strategy that pursues both local investment in clean-energy resources, such as energy efficiency and renewable distributed generation, and regional investment in energy infrastructure projects that strengthen system reliability and diversify our supply portfolio. The combination of these strategies advances our economic development interests and environmental quality; and
      </li>
      <li id="t39c31s39-31-1ol14">
       Rhode Island is committed to the increased use of no- and low-carbon energy resources that diversify our energy supply portfolio, provide affordable energy to consumers, and strengthen our shared quality of life and environment, and new energy infrastructure investments may help facilitate the development and interconnection of these resources; and
      </li>
      <li id="t39c31s39-31-1ol15">
       Rhode Island is part of an integrated, regional energy system and addressing these challenges, while meeting state policy goals, requires a coordinated, multistate approach built upon collaboration and utilizing appropriate expertise and stakeholder processes of regional entities including, but not limited to, the New England States Committee on Electricity, ISO-New England, Inc., and the New England Power Pool that takes into account affordability, energy security, reliability, fuel diversity, and environmental sustainability.

      When used in this chapter, “commercially reasonable” means terms and pricing that are reasonably consistent with what an experienced power market analyst would expect to see in transactions involving regional energy resources and regional energy infrastructure. Commercially reasonable shall include having a credible project operation date, as determined by the commission, but a project need not have completed the requisite permitting process to be considered commercially reasonable. Commercially reasonable shall require a determination by the commission that the benefits to Rhode Island exceed the cost of the project. The commission shall determine, based on the preponderance of the evidence, that the total energy security, reliability, environmental, and economic benefits to the state of Rhode Island and its ratepayers exceed the costs of such projects. If there is a dispute about whether any terms or pricing are commercially reasonable, the commission shall make the final determination after evidentiary hearings.

       deployment of wireless technology is of vital interest to the state. Rhode Island is one of the foremost states with broadband coverage and capability and must continue to lead in the advancement of new technology. Small wireless facilities are critical to delivering wireless access to advanced technology, broadband and 911 services to homes, businesses, and schools in the state. To ensure that the state and those who live and work here continue to benefit from these advanced services as soon as possible and to ensure that providers of wireless services have a fair and predictable process for the deployment of small wireless facilities, the general assembly enacts this ‘Rhode Island Small Cell Siting Act’, which specifies how local authorities may regulate the collocation of small wireless facilities and small wireless facility networks.”

       Collocation of small wireless facilities on authority poles and authority structures.

     </h3>
     <p>
      An authority may require a person to obtain a building, electrical, or a public right-of-way use or work permit to collocate small wireless facilities on authority poles or authority structures, provided such permits are of general applicability and do not apply exclusively to wireless facilities. An authority may not require a permit, other than a public right-of-way work permit, for routine maintenance on a previously approved small wireless facility or to replace a small wireless facility with a facility of substantially similar or smaller size and weight. An authority shall accept an application for, process, and issue a permit allowed under this chapter as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t39c32s39-32-3ol11">
       An authority shall receive applications for, and process and issue permits for, collocating small wireless facilities on a nondiscriminatory basis and in substantially the same manner as the permitting of other applicants within the jurisdiction of the authority. An applicant for a collocation permit shall not be required to provide more information to obtain a permit than communications service providers that are not wireless providers. If consistent with the preceding sentence, an authority may require an application to include information sufficient to determine whether the collocation meets applicable building or electrical codes or, if applicable, standards for construction in the right-of-way, provided such codes and standards are of general applicability.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c32s39-32-3ol12">
       An authority may charge a fee to process an application to collocate a small wireless facility. The fee shall be no greater than the reasonable, direct and actual costs incurred by the authority to process the application, excluding any fees for review of an application charged by third parties on a contingency basis or a result-based arrangement, and further excluding any costs already recovered by existing fees, rates, or taxes paid by a wireless provider. The application processing fee shall be no greater than the application processing fee, if any, charged by the authority to persons seeking to place a pole in the public way. Except as provided in § 39-32-5, an applicant shall not be required to pay any additional fees or charges, or perform or provide any services not directly related to the collocation, in order to collocate small wireless facilities.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c32s39-32-3ol13">
       At its discretion, an applicant shall be allowed to file a consolidated application and receive a single permit to collocate small wireless facilities at multiple locations within the jurisdiction of the authority.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c32s39-32-3ol14">
       An authority may not institute a moratorium on filing, receiving, or processing applications or issuing permits or approvals for the collocation of small wireless facilities.

       All permits regarding the collocation of small wireless facilities shall be of unlimited duration but initial construction shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after the permit issuance date, unless the authority and wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is caused by a lack of commercial power at the site.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c32s39-32-3ol16">
       Notwithstanding the provisions of § 39-32-2(c), a permit for a collocation within a historic district as defined in § 45-24.1-1.1 shall be subject to historic district commission review and approval, in accordance with standards to be adopted by regulation or rule. The standards may include that a collocation meet reasonable design, context, color, and stealth and concealment requirements and make reasonable accommodation for location within the district. The historic district commission may waive one or more standards upon a showing that the standard(s) are not reasonably compatible with the particular location of a small wireless facility, or that the standard(s) impose an excessive expense. The waiver shall be granted or denied within forty-five (45) days after the date of the request for waiver.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c32s39-32-3ol17">
       A permit may require a collocation on an authority pole that is a decorative pole to meet objective design standards, including that a collocation meet reasonable location, context, color, and stealth and concealment requirements. Such standards shall be adopted by ordinance, regulation, or rule. An authority may waive one or more standards upon a showing that the standard(s) are not reasonably compatible with the particular location of a small wireless facility, or that the standard(s) impose an excessive expense. The waiver shall be granted or denied within forty-five (45) days after the date of the request.

The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the authority and resubmit the application within thirty (30) days of the denial without paying an additional processing fee. The authority shall approve or deny the revised application within thirty (30) days. Any subsequent denial shall be limited to the deficiencies cited in the original denial. Where one or more locations addressed in a consolidated application do not meet the criteria of this section, the authority shall allow the application as to all other locations.
