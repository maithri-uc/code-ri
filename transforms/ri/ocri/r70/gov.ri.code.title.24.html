        The term “advantageous”, as used in this section, should be equated with the standard that the acquired land be reasonably required for a public purpose. O'Neill v. East Providence,
        <cite class="ocri">
         480 A.2d 1375

        When a city or town undergoes condemnation proceedings because acquisition of the property in question is advantageous to a highway-development scheme, such a taking is a constitutional exercise of the power of eminent domain. O'Neill v. East Providence,

The town manager’s report and the assessment roll shall be open to public inspection for a period of seven (7) days before the hearing required by this section. The town clerk shall give notice of the hearing by the council to determine the necessity for the improvement, composition of the district and review of the special assessment roll, and to hear objections by publication at least once in a newspaper printed and circulated in the town at least ten (10) days prior to the time of the meetings, and shall further cause notice of the meeting to be mailed by first-class mail to each property owner in the special assessment district as shown by the current assessment rolls on file with the tax assessor.

The council may revise, correct or amend the plans, estimates of cost, special assessment district and special assessment roll. If any changes shall be made which result in additions to the special assessment district or increases in the special assessment roll, then a second hearing shall be held with respect to the changes and notice of the hearing shall be given in the same manner as required for the first hearing. After the hearing, or second hearing if required, the council may, by resolution, determine to proceed with the public improvement, determine the necessity thereof and set forth the nature thereof, designate the limits of the special assessment district to be affected and describe the lands to be assessed, finally determine the part or proportion of the cost of the public improvement to be paid by the lands specially benefitted thereby and the part or portion, if any, to be paid by the town at large for benefit to the town at large. The council may also confirm the special assessment roll with the corrections as it may have made, if any, or may refer it back to the assessor for revision, or may annul it or any proceedings in connection therewith.

         All special assessments contained in any special assessment roll, including any part thereof to be paid in installments, shall, from the date of confirmation of such roll, constitute a lien upon the respective lots or parcels of land assessed and until paid shall be a charge against the respective owners of the several lots and parcels of land and a debt to the town from the persons to whom they are assessed. The lien shall be of the same character and effect as the lien created by the statute for real property taxes, and shall include accrued interest and fees. No judgment or decree nor act of the council vacating a special assessment shall destroy or impair the lien of the town upon the premises assessed for such amount of the assessment as may be equitably charged against the same, or as by a regular mode of proceeding might be lawfully assessed thereon. All special assessments shall become due upon confirmation of the special assessment roll or in annual installments, not to exceed fifteen (15) in number, as the council may determine at the time of confirmation, and, if annual installments, the council may determine the first installment to be due upon confirmation or upon any other date the council may prescribe, and the subsequent installments annually thereafter. Deferred installments shall bear interest at such rate as the council may prescribe which shall not exceed seven percent (7%) per annum.

         Whenever any special assessment roll shall be confirmed and be payable, the council shall direct the roll to the tax collector for collection. The tax collector shall mail statements of the several assessments to the respective owners of the several lots and parcels of land assessed, as indicated by the records of the assessor, stating the amount of the assessment and the manner in which it may be paid, provided, however, that failure to mail any statement shall not invalidate the assessment or entitle the owner to an extension of time during which to pay the assessment.
        </li>
        <li id="t24c02s24-2-8.4ol1a13">
         The whole or any part of any such assessment may be paid in full at any time after the date of confirmation of the special assessment roll until the time as the council shall prescribe without interest or penalty.

         Each special assessment shall be collected by the tax collector with the same rights and remedies as provided by law for the collection of taxes, except as otherwise provided herein.

         After the expiration of the period set forth in subsection (a)(13) for payment without interest or fees, any installment may be discharged by paying the face amount thereof, together with fees and interest thereon from the date of confirmation to the date of payment.

        <li id="t24c02s24-2-8.4ol1a16">
         Upon completion of the improvement, the financing and the payment of the cost thereof, the treasurer shall certify to the council the total cost of the improvement together with the amount of the original roll for the improvement.

        <li id="t24c02s24-2-8.4ol1a17">
         Should the assessments on any special assessment roll, including the amount assessed to the town at large, prove insufficient for which they were made, then the council may make additional pro rata assessments to supply the deficiency against the town and the several lots and parcels of land in the same ratio as the original assessments, but the total amount assessed against any lot or parcel of land shall not exceed the value of the benefits received from the improvement.
        </li>
        <li id="t24c02s24-2-8.4ol1a18">
         Should the special assessment or the proceeds of sale of any special assessment bonds prove larger than necessary to meet the costs of the improvement or to meet the principal and interest requirements of any special assessment bonds and expenses incidental thereof, the excess shall be placed in the town treasury. If more than five percent (5%), the excess shall be returned pro rata according to assessments; except as otherwise provided in this section. No refunds may be made which contravene the provisions of any evidence of indebtedness secured in whole or in part by such special assessment.
        </li>
        <li id="t24c02s24-2-8.4ol1a19">
         Should any lots or lands be divided after a special assessment thereon has been confirmed and divided into installments, the assessor shall apportion the uncollected amounts upon the several lots and lands so divided, and shall enter the several amounts as amendments upon the special assessment roll. The tax collector, shall, within ten (10) days after such apportionment, send notice of such action to all interested persons at their last known address by first-class mail. The apportionment shall be final and conclusive on all parties unless protest in writing is received by the tax collector within twenty (20) days of the mailing of the notice.
        </li>
        <li id="t24c02s24-2-8.4ol1a20">
         Whenever the council deems any special assessment invalid or defective, or whenever a court adjudges an assessment to be illegal in whole or in part, the council may cause a new assessment to be levied for the same purpose, whether or not the improvement or any part thereof has been completed, or any part of the special assessment collected. All proceedings on the reassessment and for the collection thereof shall be conducted in the same manner as provided for in the original assessment. If any portion of the original special assessment is collected and not refunded, it shall be applied upon the reassessment, and the reassessment shall, to that extent, be deemed satisfied. If more than the amount reassessed is collected, the balance shall be refunded to the person making such payment.
        </li>
        <li id="t24c02s24-2-8.4ol1a21">
         If, in any action, it shall appear that by reason of any irregularities or informalities, the assessment has not been properly made against the person assessed or upon the lot or premises sought to be charged, the court may, nevertheless, upon satisfactory proof that expense has been incurred by the town which is a proper charge against the person assessed or the lot or premises in question, render judgment for the amount properly chargeable against such person or upon such lot or premises.
        </li>
        <li id="t24c02s24-2-8.4ol1a22">
         In any case where the provisions of this section may prove to be insufficient to carry into full effect the making of any improvement or the special assessment therefor, the council shall provide any additional steps or procedure required to effect the improvement by special assessment in the resolution declaring the determination of the council to make such improvement in the first instance.

       </ol>

       The town of West Warwick is permitted to utilize the below listed procedure to provide for the acceptance and upgrading of highways not yet accepted into the town’s highway system:
       <ol>
        <li id="t24c02s24-2-8.5ol1a1">
         Owners of land fronting on an existing means of ingress and egress to their property which has not been accepted into the town highway system may make application to the town council for acceptance by the town of the access into the town’s highway system.
        </li>
        <li id="t24c02s24-2-8.5ol1a2">
         The application must be signed by sixty-six and two-thirds percent (662/3%) of the owners of land with frontage on the access presented for acceptance.
        </li>
        <li id="t24c02s24-2-8.5ol1a3">
         The access presented for acceptance must be connectable to an accepted town highway or a highway maintained by the state.

          <li id="t24c02s24-2-8.5ol1a4-i">
           Upon receipt of application, the town will obtain an estimate of cost to create from the access a highway to be accepted by the town into the town highway system.
          </li>
          <li id="t24c02s24-2-8.5ol1a4-ii">
           The town shall provide the applicants with a copy of the estimate.

        <li id="t24c02s24-2-8.5ol1a5">
         To have the access improved or a road constructed by the town the applicants shall agree by written contract to the following:

          <li id="t24c02s24-2-8.5ol1a5-i">
           To repay the town for the cost of construction or improvement as outlined in the estimate provided them. Repayment to the town shall not exceed fifteen (15) years and shall be repaid with interest not to exceed the “prime rate” at the date of contract.

          <li id="t24c02s24-2-8.5ol1a5-ii">
           The percentage of repayment of the total estimate for each landowner shall be based on the frontage owned by the landowner divided by the total frontage on both sides of the access.

           The repayment agreement shall be binding on the landowner’s heirs and assigns, shall be recorded on the land records of the town, shall create a tax lien against the land until fully repaid and shall be collectable on nonpayment under the provisions of chapter 9 of title 44.
          </li>
          <li id="t24c02s24-2-8.5ol1a5-iv">
           The landowner shall deed to the town the land necessary for construction or improvement as the town shall designate.

          <li id="t24c02s24-2-8.5ol1a5-v">
           Upon completion of the obligations of the applicants and the recording of the repayment contract the town shall contract for the construction or improvements outlined in the estimate and shall accept the improved highway into the town highway system and shall be liable for the mending and repairing of the highway.
          </li>
          <li id="t24c02s24-2-8.5ol1a5-vi">
           The town is entitled during construction or improvement of the access into an acceptable town highway to use those portions of the applying landowner’s property as needed to construct or improve the highway without payment of compensation to the landowner.

The commissioners shall set forth in the report the names of the owners of, and persons in any way interested in, any of the land taken for the proposed improvement, so far as the names can be ascertained, and a description or designation of the several parcels thereof, with the damage and benefit to each respectively.

      Whenever any abutting owner shall deem himself or herself to be injured by any change in the grade of a highway, and the owner shall make a claim for compensation for the injury to the town council within forty (40) days after the change of grade shall have been completed, the town council shall appoint three (3) suitable and indifferent persons, not interested in the lands bordering on the highway the grade of which has been changed, who shall be engaged to the faithful discharge of their duties, and who shall go upon the highway when the grade thereof has been changed, and examine the highway, and the estate alleged to have been injured by changing the grade of the highway, and endeavor to agree with the owner of the estate as to the amount of damage sustained by the owner by means of the change of grade, and if they agree with the owner, they shall reduce the agreement to writing and report the agreement to the town council, which report shall be binding upon the owner and upon the town; but if they fail to agree with the owner as to the damage, they shall report the failure to the town council, whereupon the council, after notice to the owner and offering him or her an opportunity to be heard, shall proceed to appraise the damage done to the owner by means of the change of grade.

        Subsections (a) and (c) (now see (f) and (i)) of § 31-1-23 in defining highway and roadway contemplate that a highway is wider than a roadway and includes the “entire width” between the boundary lines of the public way, including the sidewalk, berm, or shoulder; it therefore follows that if the vegetation obstructing the view of the motorist in the accident was located on the town’s property and within the boundary lines of the highway, then the town was under a duty to keep this portion of the highway “safe and convenient for travelers” pursuant to this section.

      Every surveyor of highways shall execute the directions given to the surveyor by the town council or the committee thereof as provided for in this chapter, and shall purchase and use such materials and employ such personnel, teams, and road making apparatus as may be necessary therefor at the rates of compensation fixed by the town council.

       If any person shall incur damage to his or her motor vehicle by reason of a pothole on any municipal highway, causeway, street or bridge which damage would not have occurred without the existence of the pothole, he or she may recover from the municipality the amount of damages sustained up to and not more than the sum of three hundred dollars ($300). Provided, however, that the municipality had reasonable notice of the pothole, or may have had notice thereof by the exercise of proper care and diligence on its part, and a reasonable opportunity to repair the pothole. All claims shall be made within a period of seven (7) days from the date on which the damage was sustained by filing a written report in a manner prescribed by the municipality. In no instance, however, shall any claim for damage so caused to a motor vehicle registered in a foreign state be considered unless that state has a similar statute affording similar protection to persons owning motor vehicles registered in this state.

      The several towns shall provide by ordinance in a manner and under such penalties as they may deem expedient, for removing snow from the public highways so as to render the public highways passable with teams, sleds, and sleighs; but nothing contained in this chapter shall be so construed as to render any town or city liable for any injury to person or property caused by snow or ice obstructing any or any part of the highways therein, unless notice in writing of the existence of the particular obstruction shall have been given to the surveyor of highways within whose district the obstruction exists, at least twenty-four (24) hours before the injury was caused, and the town or surveyor shall not thereupon within twenty-four (24) hours of notification have commenced the removal of the obstruction, or caused any sidewalk which may have been obstructed by ice to be rendered passable, by spreading ashes or other like substances thereon. Whenever any highway is blocked up or encumbered with snow, the surveyor shall cause so much thereof to be removed or trod down as to render the highway passable.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The trial justice properly ruled that the notice required under this section was a condition precedent that must be complied with before plaintiff could bring her tort action against the municipality. Hareld v. Napolitano,
        <cite class="ocri">
         615 A.2d 1015

       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not mandate that the claimant be the person who gives notice to the city. The sole requisite is that notice must have been given of the obstruction or dangerous situation by someone at least 24 hours before the time of the injury. Hareld v. Napolitano,
        <cite class="ocri">
         615 A.2d 1015

       </p>
       <p>
        The notice requirement in this section does not amount to an unconstitutional denial of access to the courts in violation of R.I. Const. art. 1, § 5. Art. I, sec. 5 should not be interpreted to bar the Legislature from enacting any laws that may limit a party from bringing a claim in Rhode Island courts, and notice requirements that are imposed only on victims of governmental tortfeasors are rationally based and constitutionally valid.

        The provision requiring notice of obstruction does not apply to a case where ice would not have formed but for a defect in the highway. McCloskey v. Moies,
        <cite class="ocri">

        In the absence of previous written notice, city was not liable for injury caused by ice unless on a showing that defect causing ice to form would have been dangerous even without the ice. Allen v. Cook,

        In enacting this section the legislature did not intend to establish any separate and distinct remedy applicable to snow and ice cases, but did intend to restrict the availability of § 45-15-8 in such cases. Barroso v. Pepin,

        In an action for personal injury suffered by plaintiff in a fall on a city sidewalk in which the trial judge granted defendant’s motion for a directed verdict and then plaintiff raised the question as to the constitutionality of the notice requirement of this section, the court will not pass on the constitutionality of an act where the question was not raised with particularity in the trial court.

        Sections 24-5-12 and 24-5-13 specifically impose liability on towns for personal injuries resulting from neglect to keep town highways in repair. There are no comparable statutes applicable to the state’s duty as to state highways under this section. Knudsen v. Hall,

      The purpose of §§ 24-8-1.1 — 24-8-1.7 is to establish a pavement management program to better maintain the state’s highways in a safe and serviceable condition. In order to fairly distribute funds for a pavement management program, an equitable system to determine jurisdiction on highways is needed. The principles of highway functional classification, or the importance of roads in terms of the type of travel service provided, shall be used to determine jurisdiction. Roads serving longer-distance travel, connecting city and town centers and major traffic generators shall be the state’s responsibility. Roads serving local travel shall be under city or town jurisdiction.

        The state’s execution of a construction and maintenance agreement with a city in which the state unequivocally agreed to maintain a sidewalk divested the city of any duty of maintenance and so the city owed no duty to keep the sidewalk safe for pedestrian travel. Pullen v. State,

Accordingly, the director is authorized to regulate direct vehicle access to state roads in situations whereby access may reasonably tend to affect the safe condition and integrity of state roads. This includes the authority to regulate the type, location, and width of roadways and driveways at their intersection with state highways and the authority to regulate construction within state highway right-of-ways.

These rules and regulations shall apply prospectively and shall be based on accepted engineering and construction standards.

      If any person shall incur damage to his or her motor vehicle by reason of a pothole on any state highway, causeway, or bridge which damage would not have occurred without the existence of the pothole, he or she may recover from the state the amount of damages sustained up to and not more than the sum of three hundred dollars ($300). All claims shall be made within a period of seven (7) days from the date on which the damage was sustained by filing a written report in a manner prescribed by the director of the department of transportation who shall in all instances make the final determination as to the merits of any claim so submitted. All claims approved by the director shall be paid in full within forty-five (45) days of the final approval. In no instance, however, shall any claim for damage so caused to a motor vehicle registered in a foreign state be considered unless that state has a similar statute affording similar protection to persons owning motor vehicles registered in this state.

        In a case in which plaintiff was injured when his vehicle struck a pothole, the Supreme Court held that the State’s failure to repair the pothole was shielded from tort liability under the public duty doctrine. It disagreed with plaintiff’s contention that this section creates a limited exception to the public duty doctrine that was applicable.

      While appropriations adequate to meet the normal average needs of the department of transportation in the performance of its duties relating to maintenance of roads and related matters are annually made in legislation appropriating funds for each fiscal year, the general assembly recognizes the necessity for anticipating and making advance provision to care for the unusual and extraordinary burdens imposed on the department by reason of extreme climatic phenomena and other emergencies. For these purposes, it is the intention of the general assembly to forearm the department, vesting it with adequate power and authority within the limitation of available funds in the storm emergency account to meet any such emergency.

      In order to prevent unreasonable distraction of operators of motor vehicles, to prevent confusion with respect to compliance with traffic lights, signs, signals and regulations, to promote the safety, convenience, and enjoyment of travel upon highways within this state and to protect the public investment therein, to preserve and enhance the natural scenic beauty or aesthetic features of the highways and adjacent areas, and in the general welfare of the people of this state, the general assembly declares it to be the policy of this state that the erection and maintenance of outdoor advertising in areas adjacent to the rights-of-way of the interstate, primary, secondary road systems within this state shall be regulated in accordance with the terms of this chapter and the regulations promulgated by the director of transportation pursuant thereto and finds that all outdoor advertising which does not conform to the requirements of this chapter is a public nuisance. It is the intention of the general assembly in this chapter to provide a statutory basis for regulation of outdoor advertising consistent with the public policy relating to areas adjacent to the interstate and primary highway systems as declared by congress in title 23 of the United States Code, Highways. Further, the general assembly declares the policy also to regulate other roads within the state.

        Rhode Island Outdoor Advertising Act (RIOAA), broadly defines outdoor advertising to include advertising or information, at R.I. Gen. Laws § 24-10.1-2(4), a definition that reasonably can be said to encompass both commercial and noncommercial speech. In practice, however, the RIOAA’s on-premise/off-premise distinction does not allow any noncommercial speech wherever a commercial message would be permissible. Vono v. Lewis,

      Any owner of or persons entitled to any estate in or interested in any part of the land, or interest therein, so taken, who cannot agree with the authority for the price of the land, or interest therein, so taken in which he or she is interested may, within three (3) months after personal notice of the taking, or, if he or she have no personal notice, may within one year from the first publication of the copy of the resolution and statement, apply by petition to the superior court in and for the county in which the land, or interest therein, lies, setting forth the taking of his or her land or interest therein, and praying for an assessment of damages by a jury. Upon filing of the petition the court shall cause twenty (20) days’ notice of the pendency thereof to be given to the authority by serving the chairperson or vice chairperson of the authority with a certified copy thereof, and may proceed after notice to the trial thereof; and the trial shall determine all questions of fact relating to the value of the land, or interest therein, and the amount thereof, and judgment shall be entered upon the verdict of the jury and execution shall be issued therefor against the money so deposited in court and in default thereof against any other property of the authority.

      The proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project or projects for which the bonds shall have been issued, and shall be disbursed in the manner and under the restrictions, if any, as the authority may provide in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust agreement hereinafter mentioned securing the bonds; provided, however, that the amount of the proceeds of the revenue bonds of the first series as may be determined by the authority prior to the issuance of the bonds may be applied to the payment of engineering, financing, and legal services in connection with the financing and the construction of the Newport Bridge or the turnpike or both. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue, by error of estimates or otherwise, shall be less than the cost, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of the deficit, and, unless otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds or in the trust agreement securing the bonds, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without preference of priority of the bonds first issued. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the cost, the surplus shall be deposited to the credit of the sinking fund for the bonds or, if so authorized by the authority, may be applied to the payment of the cost of any project thereafter financed under the provisions of this chapter.

      In the discretion of the authority any bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter may be secured by a trust agreement by and between the authority and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the state. The trust agreement or the resolution providing for the issuance of the bonds may pledge or assign the tolls and other revenues to be received, but shall not convey or mortgage any project or any part thereof. The trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of the bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property and the construction, improvement, maintenance, repair, operation, and insurance of the project or projects in connection with which the bonds shall have been authorized, the rates of toll to be charged, the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys, and conditions or limitations with respect to the issuance of additional bonds. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the state which may act as depositary of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues to furnish the indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Any trust agreement may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. In addition to the foregoing, any trust agreement or resolution may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of the trust agreement or resolution may be treated as a part of the authority’s cost of operation and maintenance.

      It is hereby declared to be the policy of the state to prevent the economic harm to the town of Jamestown which will occur upon the opening of the Newport Bridge to traffic through loss of employment opportunities on the Jamestown and Newport ferries and the resultant dislocation of the residence of the Jamestown and Newport ferries employees, therefore:

      </li>
      <li id="t24c12s24-12-49ol12">
       The several departments of the state government including the personnel department are hereby charged with the responsibility of providing employment opportunities within the state classified service and within reasonable commuting distance of their residences, for employees of the department of transportation who were employed in connection with the operation of ferries from Jamestown to Newport and whose employment has been terminated by reason of the opening of the Newport Bridge to traffic.
      </li>
      <li id="t24c12s24-12-49ol13">

       To achieve a cleaner, greener transportation system the transportation plans of Rhode Island should consider the needs of all users of our roadways including pedestrians, bicyclists, public transportation riders, motorists and citizens of all ages and abilities, including children, the elderly and the disabled. By encouraging good planning, more citizens will achieve the health benefits associated with active forms of transportation while traffic congestion and automobile related air pollution will be reduced. Therefore, it shall be the policy of the state to consider people of all ages and abilities and all appropriate forms of transportation when planning roadway projects.

       For all state and local transportation projects that are eligible for both federal and state funding and are subject to department of transportation oversight, Rhode Island must provide for the consideration of safe travel by all users of the road network, including motorists, pedestrians, bicyclists, and public transportation users, regardless of age or ability, through the use of complete street design features for safe travel in the planning, design, and construction of new or reconstructed facilities, but not including, resurfacing, or other maintenance — level projects.

These features of complete street design shall include, but not be limited to, sidewalks, paved shoulders suitable for use by bicyclists, lane striping, bicycle lanes, share the road signage, “road diets,” roundabouts, crosswalks, pedestrian control signalization, bus pull outs, curb cuts, raised crosswalks and ramps and traffic calming measures.

      The general assembly finds that:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t24c17s24-17-2ol11">
       The State of Rhode Island, through the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (“RIDOT”), funds the repair, replacement, and maintenance of bridges in Rhode Island, except the Newport Bridge and the Mount Hope Bridge.
      </li>
      <li id="t24c17s24-17-2ol12">
       Rhode Island depends on three primary sources for funding all transportation infrastructure construction, maintenance, and operations. These sources are Federal funds, State bond funds, and motor fuel tax revenue. Of these sources, two (Federal funds and motor fuel tax revenue) are mutable.
      </li>
      <li id="t24c17s24-17-2ol13">
       The 2008 Governor’s Blue Ribbon Panel on Transportation Funding and the 2011 Senate Special Commission on Sustainable Transportation funding determined that there is insufficient revenue available from all existing sources to fund the maintenance and improvement of Rhode Island transportation infrastructure.
      </li>
      <li id="t24c17s24-17-2ol14">
       In 2011, the Rhode Island general assembly adopted a component of the recommended systemic change to transportation funding by creating the Rhode Island Highway Maintenance Trust Fund, to be funded by an increase in license and registration fees and contributions from the Rhode Island Capital Plan (RICAP) fund, beginning in FY2014.
      </li>
      <li id="t24c17s24-17-2ol15">
       Although the State is shifting from long-term borrowing to annual revenues to fund transportation infrastructure, there is still a funding gap between the revenue needed to maintain all roads and bridges in good condition and the annual amounts generated by current revenue sources.
      </li>
      <li id="t24c17s24-17-2ol16">
       The State has sufficient financial resources to complete the construction of the new Sakonnet River Bridge and to demolish the existing Sakonnet River Bridge, but does not have sufficient financial resources to assure the future maintenance and operation of the Sakonnet River Bridge.
      </li>
      <li id="t24c17s24-17-2ol17">
       There is limited access to and from Rhode Island’s East Bay, consisting of Bristol and Newport Counties, and this access is restricted both by geography and infrastructure. The most critical infrastructure includes the four bridges that comprise the access to Aquidneck Island and Conanicut Island. These four bridges make up less than half a percent of the total bridges in the state, but comprise approximately twenty percent of the deck area of all Rhode Island bridges.
      </li>
      <li id="t24c17s24-17-2ol18">
       Two of the four bridges, the Sakonnet River Bridge and the Jamestown Verrazzano Bridge, are owned and maintained by RIDOT. The Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority (“RITBA”) currently owns and maintains the other two bridges: the Newport Bridge and the Mount Hope Bridge.
      </li>
      <li id="t24c17s24-17-2ol19">
       In the current economic and political climate, cooperation between State departments and/or quasi-public agencies provides the best opportunity to maximize financial and knowledge-based resources.
      </li>
      <li id="t24c17s24-17-2ol110">
       RITBA currently assesses a toll for passage over the Newport Bridge, and this toll serves as the sole source of revenue for RITBA to maintain both the Newport Bridge and the Mount Hope Bridge and related appurtenances.
      </li>
      <li id="t24c17s24-17-2ol111">
       The Federal Highway Administration allows for the placement of tolls on certain transportation infrastructure in order to assure the improvement and proper operation and maintenance of the structure and associated roadways.
      </li>
      <li id="t24c17s24-17-2ol112">
       The current toll structure places undue burden on the residents, businesses, and visitors who must use the Newport Bridge to access work, schools, shopping, and other essential services. It is crucial to establish a comprehensive strategy to fund and maintain the bridges connecting the East Bay.
      </li>
      <li id="t24c17s24-17-2ol113">
       The transfer of the Sakonnet River Bridge and its appurtenances and the Jamestown Verrazzano Bridge and its appurtenances to the Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority would be in the best interests of the State of Rhode Island and its residents, particularly those living and working in the East Bay.
      </li>
      <li id="t24c17s24-17-2ol114">
       The placement of a toll on the Sakonnet River Bridge, under the direction of RITBA, would serve to create a more viable means of funding future maintenance and repairs of the East Bay bridges and would allow for the establishment of a more equitable toll structure, along with a fund for capital transportation projects and preventive maintenance in the East Bay.
