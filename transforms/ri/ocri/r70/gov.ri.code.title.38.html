      The public records administration program of the secretary of state shall have the right to examine the condition of public records and shall give advice and assistance to public officials in the solution of their problems of preserving, creating, filing, and making available the public records in their custody. When requested by the program, public officials shall assist the program in the preparation of records control schedules of public records in their custody approved by the head of the agency having custody of the records. Upon review and approval of the schedules by the program, the program shall, subject to the availability of necessary space, staff, and other facilities for those purposes, make available space in its record center for the filing of semi-current records so scheduled and in its public records repository for noncurrent records of permanent value and shall render other assistance as needed, including the microfilming of records so scheduled.

      The public’s right to access to public records and the individual’s right to dignity and privacy are both recognized to be principles of the utmost importance in a free society. The purpose of this chapter is to facilitate public access to public records. It is also the intent of this chapter to protect from disclosure information about particular individuals maintained in the files of public bodies when disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.

        The underlying policy of the Access to Public Records Act favors the free flow and disclosure of information to the public. However, the Legislature did not intend to empower the press and the public with carte blanche to demand all records held by public agencies. Providence Journal Co. v. Sundlun,

        Access to Public Records Act, R.I. Gen.

Gen. Laws § 39-5-1, and a court had no subject matter jurisdiction to review the commission’s decision to release the information. In re New Eng. Gas Co.,

        Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission’s rules concerning disclosure require it to consider public requests for records in its possession according to the provisions of the Access to Public Records Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 38-2-1 et seq., as access to public records shall be granted in accordance with the Access to Public Records Act, under R.I. Pub. Util. Comm’n R. 1.2(g)(1), and even a preliminary finding that some documents are privileged do not preclude the Commission’s release of those documents pursuant to a public request in accordance with R.I.

       <p>
        Under the Access to Public Records Act (APRA), R.I. Gen. Laws § 38-2-1 et seq., the legislature has cast a public official as the guardian of exempted material, and his or her discretion in respect to disclosure cannot be challenged by a private party, so, if a remedy is to be provided, it must be provided by the legislature and not by the court as the APRA is directed solely toward requiring disclosure by public agencies and does not provide a reverse remedy to prevent disclosure. In re New Eng. Gas Co.,

        Although the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission’s (PUC or Commission) rules provide a mechanism for a party to a PUC proceeding to request a “preliminary finding” that some or all of the information it may have submitted to the Commission is exempt from the mandatory public disclosure requirements of the Access to Public Records Act (APRA), R.I. Gen. Laws § 38-2-1 et seq., neither the Commission rules nor the APRA provide a remedy to that party to prevent disclosure once the Commission determines the information is public. In re New Eng.

        Policy underlying the Access to Public Records Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 38-2-1 et seq., is to facilitate public access to governmental records which pertain to the policy making functions of public bodies, and the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission employs this policy when entertaining arguments that information submitted to it in rate cases should remain confidential, so R.I. Pub. Util. Comm’n R. 1.2(g)(1) provides that any claim of privilege shall be governed by the policy underlying the Access to Public Records Act (APRA), R.I. Gen. Laws § 38-2-1 et seq., with the burden of proof resting on the party claiming the privilege, and in accord with the APRA’s policy favoring disclosure, the exemptions listed in the APRA are to be construed narrowly, so as to further the legislative purpose of facilitating public access to governmental records.

        Where procedure was established whereby any civilian complaint of police brutality was to be subject of evidentiary hearing before hearing officer, after which hearing a written finding of policeman’s guilt or innocence was to be forwarded to police chief for his approval or rejection, finding was not a recommendation as to further personnel action but was a final action in itself, and thus was not subject to the personnel-record or investigatory-record exception.

        The trial court erred in granting summary judgment to an intervenor newspaper owner against a former member of the police department, since the access to public records statute only creates a cause of action for an individual or entity denied access to records maintained by a public body against that public body as custodian of the records, and in the case at bar the former officer was neither a “public body” nor the custodian of the records, and the city was not a party to the summary judgment as record custodian.

       Any reasonably segregable portion of a public record excluded by § 38-2-2(4) shall be available for public inspection after the deletion of the information which is the basis of the exclusion.

        These procedures must include, but need not be limited to, the identification of a designated public records officer or unit, how to make a public records request, and where a public record request should be made, and a copy of these procedures shall be posted on the public body’s website if such a website is maintained and be made otherwise readily available to the public. The unavailability of a designated public records officer shall not be deemed good cause for failure to timely comply with a request to inspect and/or copy public records pursuant to subsection (e). A written request for public records need not be made on a form established by a public body if the request is otherwise readily identifiable as a request for public records.

If the inspection or copying is not permitted within ten (10) business days, the public body shall forthwith explain in writing the need for additional time to comply with the request. Any such explanation must be particularized to the specific request made. In such cases the public body may have up to an additional twenty (20) business days to comply with the request if it can demonstrate that the voluminous nature of the request, the number of requests for records pending, or the difficulty in searching for and retrieving or copying the requested records, is such that additional time is necessary to avoid imposing an undue burden on the public body.

        This section provides a judicial remedy to a person or entity denied access to records alleged to be public records. The first remedy is an administrative appeal under subsection (a). The second remedy pursuant to subsection (b) would be to seek the aid of the attorney general in instituting proceedings for the injunctive or declaratory relief. This section also provides for a private action for injunctive or declaratory relief in the superior court of the county where the record is maintained. Rhode Island Fed'n of Teachers v. Sundlun,

       Reproduction of public records — Destruction of original records.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If any department or agency of government, in the regular course of business or activity, has kept or recorded any memorandum, writing, state tax returns, report, application, payment, entry, print, representation, or combination thereof, or any act, transaction, occurrence, or event, and, in the regular course of business, has caused any or all of the records to be recorded, copied, or reproduced by a photographic, photostatic, microfilm, micro-card, optical disk, miniature photographic, or other process which accurately reproduces or forms a durable medium for reproducing the original, the original may be destroyed in the regular course of business, provided the process meets standards established by the public records administration, and provided all the provisions of § 38-3-6 concerning disposal of public records are fulfilled. The reproduction, when satisfactorily identified, shall be admissible in evidence as the original in any judicial or administrative proceeding whether or not the original exists or is available and an enlargement or facsimile of the reproduction shall be likewise admissible in evidence if the original is in existence and available for inspection under the direction of the court. The introduction of a reproduced record, enlargement, or facsimile into evidence shall not preclude the admission into evidence of the original. This section shall not be construed to exclude from introduction into evidence any document or copy thereof which is otherwise admissible under the Rhode Island general laws, as amended.
