        The opening of a joint bank account wherein survivorship rights are specifically provided for is conclusive evidence of the intention to transfer to the survivor an immediate in praesenti joint beneficial possessory ownership right in the balance of the account remaining after the death of the depositor, absent evidence of fraud, undue influence, duress, or lack of mental capacity. Likewise, if a joint bank account does not provide for survivorship rights, that absence will be conclusive evidence of an intent not to transfer any right of ownership to the survivor, absent evidence of mistake or fraud.

      When it appears that wood and timber standing on land, the use and improvement of which belongs, for life or otherwise, to a person other than the owner of the fee in the land, have ceased to improve by growth, or ought for any cause to be cut, the superior court may on petition appoint a trustee, and authorize and empower the trustee to sell and convey the wood and timber, to be cut and carried away within a time to be limited in the order of sale, and to hold, invest, reinvest, and change the investment of the proceeds thereof, after paying therefrom the expenses of the sale, and to pay over the income, above the taxes and other expenses of the trust, to the person entitled to the use and improvement while his or her right thereto continues, and, at the expiration of the right, to pay the principal sum to the owner of the land. When wood and timber have been cut as provided by this section, no more shall be cut on the land by the person entitled to the use and improvement without permission from the court. When a sale is authorized under this section, the trustee shall give, to the person as the court shall designate, a bond for the use and benefit of the persons interested in the proceeds of the sale, with condition for the faithful discharge of the trust; and the court may from time to time remove the trustee and appoint another in his or her stead, or fill a vacancy in the trusteeship whenever occasion may require.

     <p>
      When real estate is subject to a contingent remainder, executory devise, or power of appointment, the superior court may, upon the petition of any person who has an estate in possession in the real estate, and after notice and other proceedings as required by this chapter, appoint one or more trustees and authorize him or her or them to sell and convey the estate or any part thereof in fee simple, if the sale and conveyance appears to the court to be necessary or expedient, for such an amount, and on such terms, as the court may deem proper; and the conveyance shall be valid and binding upon all parties. The trustee or trustees may, in the discretion of the court, and upon such terms and conditions as the court may prescribe, execute a mortgage of the estate or any part thereof, which mortgage may contain such powers of sale, conditions, and covenants as are usual in mortgages taken by savings banks in this state. Notes secured by, and covenants contained in, mortgages executed by the trustee or trustees, so far as those notes and covenants are made by the trustee or trustees in his or her or their representative capacity, shall not bind the trustee or trustees personally, but only the trust estate.

The trustee shall give bond in such sum as the court may order and shall, under the direction of the court, manage and account for the trust fund and shall distribute the income thereof according to its decree. In case of appointment of a trustee, the court shall have power to remove him and appoint another in his stead, and to fill a vacancy in the trusteeship, whenever occasion may require.

        Summary judgment was precluded where, although the record showed that the property in dispute was a grassy field for many years and was used primarily for the cultivation of hay, there remained disputed facts about who mowed and where, the nature and extent of the contested area’s use, and whether the defendant ever was aware of a land swap or had acquiesced in the new boundary line between lots.

        Alleged landowners did not prove in a quiet title action their adverse possession claim pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-7-1 by clear and convincing evidence and, thus, they were not entitled to the disputed property under that theory. They did not show that the use of property was actual, open, notorious, hostile, under a claim of right, continuous, and exclusive for at least 10 years, as that statute required. Corrigan v. Nanian,

        Trial justice misconstrued the claim-of-right doctrine when the justice ruled that the adverse claimants and their predecessors failed to satisfy the elements of adverse possession; furthermore, the trial court should not have weighed the record-title holder’s out-of-state residence as a factor in deciding that the claimants failed to meet the strict standard of proof required in adverse possession cases. Finally, the trial justice erred in determining that a predecessor of the claimants had engaged in inequitable conduct by attempting to bootstrap himself into owning the property after the predecessor discovered that the predecessor did not hold record title.

        When a neighbor claimed adverse possession of a parcel to which a landowner held title, it was error for a trial court to hold that the neighbor’s offers to buy the parcel did not affect the neighbor’s claim because the offers outwardly declared to the parcel’s owner the viability of the owner’s title and fully admitted the neighbor’s subservient interest to that title, interrupting the neighbor’s claim’s accrual, as (1) the offers did not merely show the neighbor knew the neighbor was not the record owner, and (2) the offers were not made to make peace in an ongoing dispute, destroying the elements of hostility and claim of right, so any incidents of ownership by the neighbor after the neighbor’s first offer interrupted the neighbor’s claim could not be considered.

        When a neighbor claimed adverse possession of a parcel to which a landowner held title, it was error for a trial court to assume the neighbor’s offers to purchase the parcel from the landowner’s predecessor did not destroy the viability of the neighbor’s claim based on the passage of time prior to the offers because the offers were relevant to determining the neighbor’s claim of right and hostile possession during the statutory period.

        When a neighbor’s adverse possession claim was remanded to a trial court, the trial court had to determine if the neighbor adequately claimed possession of the entire subject parcel because the neighbor’s initial letter to the owner asserting adverse possession claimed only “a 20-foot strip,” which was less than half the entire parcel.

        Neighbor did not establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that the neighbor’s alleged adverse possession of a real estate parcel was open and notorious because, when the neighbor laid crushed stone on the parcel, planted trees on the parcel, and hired someone to keep the parcel clear of debris, these actions were not of sufficient magnitude to put the world on notice of the neighbor’s claim of ownership, since the neighbor did not mow the parcel or erect a fence or other structure, and the parcel was described as “wild and wooded” prior to the neighbor’s actions.

        Seasonal use of a rural path does not impair a defendant’s claim of an easement by prescription because it is well settled that even in adverse-possession cases where stricter standards are applied, it is only necessary to show that the claimant has acted toward the land in question as would an average owner, taking properly into account the geophysical nature of the land.

        Where plaintiff intermittently used defendant’s right-of-way for almost 25 years to access his property, his claim to a prescriptive easement over the right-of-way failed because he did not establish by clear and satisfactory evidence that his intermittent use, which did not approach regularity until a few years before trial—was open, notorious, and continuous for a period of 10 years.

        In an adverse possession action, the trial court properly entered judgment for defendants on the basis that plaintiffs failed to prove their use of the disputed parcel was hostile, as the parties’ indemnification agreement, made after the statutory 10-year period, granting plaintiffs the right to use the parcel to hang a hammock in exchange for their promise to hold defendants harmless from any injury that might result, was an acknowledgment by plaintiffs of defendants’ superior title in that parcel.

        As R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-7-9 was not enacted until years after plaintiff sued a nonprofit conservation association, claiming the right to use the association’s beachfront property to access its land, § 34-7-9 did not bar plaintiff’s claim; although the original complaint did not use the words “prescriptive easement,” it put the association on sufficient notice that plaintiff was claiming such an easement.

        Where the period for a prescriptive easement had expired prior to the termination of defendant’s lease, well before the plaintiff filed notice of her intent to dispute adverse possession, and where there was no evidence that the plaintiff objected to defendant’s installation of a water line or its continuous use prior to the expiration of the lease, there was no suggestion that the pipe, although installed in full view of the plaintiff, was installed with her permission.

One of these distances, to be known as the “x-coordinate”, shall give the position in an east and west direction; the other, to be known as the “y-coordinate”, shall give the position in a north and south direction. These coordinates shall be made to depend upon and conform to plane rectangular coordinate values for the monumented points of the North American horizontal geodetic control network as published by the national ocean survey/national geodetic survey or its successors, and whose plane coordinates have been computed on the systems defined in this chapter.

     <p>
      No coordinates based on either Rhode Island coordinate system, purporting to define the position of a point on land boundary, shall be presented to be recorded in any public land records or deed records unless such point is within one kilometer of a monumented horizontal control station and unless minimum THIRD ORDER — class II procedures are used in conformity with the standards of accuracy and specifications prepared and published by the federal geodetic control committee established in conformity with the standards of accuracy and specifications for first — or second-order geodetic surveying as prepared and published by the federal geodetic control committee (FGCC) of the United States department of commerce. Standards and specifications of the FGCC or its successor in force on date of the survey shall apply. The publishing of the existing control stations, or the acceptance with intent to publish the newly established control stations, by the national ocean survey/national geodetic survey will constitute evidence of adherence to the FGCC specifications. Above limitations may be modified by the Rhode Island department of transportation land surveying section to meet local conditions.

        A wood fence 51/2 feet high, erected on the builder’s own land and about 2 feet from retaining wall of 5 to 7 feet in height which separated builder’s land from that of another, did not constitute a private nuisance under this section and could not be enjoined. Musumeci v. Leonardo,

      Every conveyance of lands, tenements or hereditament absolutely, by way of mortgage, or on condition, use or trust, for any term longer than one year, and all declarations of trusts concerning the conveyance, shall be void unless made in writing duly signed, acknowledged as hereinafter provided, delivered, and recorded in the records of land evidence in the town or city where the lands, tenements or hereditaments are situated; provided, however, that the conveyance, if delivered, as between the parties and their heirs, and as against those taking by gift or devise, or those having notice thereof, shall be valid and binding though not acknowledged or recorded. A lease for the term of one year or less shall be valid although made by parol. Leases for terms of more than one year may be recorded with a memorandum of lease in writing rather than the original lease; provided, however, that the memorandum shall contain the names of the parties to be charged, a description of the real estate, the duration of the lease, including renewal options and purchase options.

P. 12(b)(6), by and through their conduct, the plaintiffs had validated the mortgage. As such, they failed to allege sufficient facts that the mortgage was not properly executed on which relief can be granted and therefore their first argument under count I for interim relief was rejected.

        Where the word “covenants” was used merely as descriptive of agreements which were not covenants, and the character of the instrument was not such as to imply a seal, suit for enforcement was properly filed in assumpsit instead of covenant. Providence Tel. Pub. Co. v. Crahan Engraving Co.,

        Grantor who conveyed property to a grantee could not claim title later to that real property by adverse possession against the grantee’s successor. A warranty deed’s covenants of quiet enjoyment and future defense of title precluded the grantor from setting up any claim of adverse possession against the grantee’s successors. Carrozza v.

        Real estate buyers were not entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees against a seller for defending the title to the buyers’ property, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-11-15(5), against the seller’s claim of an easement, because (1) the warranty to defend was limited to successful attacks on the buyers’ title, which did not occur, since the buyers successfully defended against the seller’s attack, and (2) there was no reason to create an exception to the general rule that warranty covenants did not entitle a grantee to recover attorneys’ fees from a grantor for a successful defense of a title.

        Once premises are conveyed by a quitclaim deed, absent any limitations in the deed specifying that redemption applied only to a particular tax deed, all of the conveyor’s interest in the property is extinguished, including the ability to foreclose the right of redemption.

        Since a conveyor of premises by quitclaim deed made a unilateral mistake by omitting an amount due for a tax deed, the redemption deed was not invalidated, and the motion justice properly determined that foreclosure of the right of redemption in respect to a tax sale was not permitted.

        Once premises are conveyed by a quitclaim deed, absent any limitations in the deed specifying that redemption applied only to a particular tax deed, all of the conveyor’s interest in the property is extinguished, including the ability to foreclose the right of redemption.

        Since a conveyor of premises by quitclaim deed made a unilateral mistake by omitting an amount due for a tax deed, the redemption deed was not invalidated, and the motion justice properly determined that foreclosure of the right of redemption in respect to a tax sale was not permitted.

        When a developer granted an adjoining landowner an easement over the developer’s property, then subsequently bought the adjoining landowner’s property, reserving the easement, but, when it sold the burdened property to another, did not specifically reserve the easement in the deed, under the merger doctrine the easement was extinguished.

        Developer did not show an easement by necessity over an adjoining landowner’s property because access to the developer’s lots, without using the easement, was feasible, and the developer sought access by way of the easement merely to avoid inconvenience and expense.

        Although the hearing justice correctly stated that an easement appurtenant would pass by deed of the dominant tenement even if not specifically mentioned and that the owner of a dominant estate could extinguish an easement appurtenant only by specifically excluding it from the conveyance of the dominant tenement, summary judgment was not appropriate as the justice prematurely determined that property owners enjoyed an easement to access a beach. The justice should have first determined whether an implied easement or easement by necessity existed. McElroy v. Stephens,

        In the event that property is added to a unified dominant estate, such an estate in its entirety would receive the benefit of the right-of-way attached to the dominant estate; if the dominant estate is later divided, the owner or assignee of any portion of the dominant estate might claim the easement so far as it is applicable to his part of the property as long as an unreasonable burden is not imposed upon the servient estate. Such a result occurs without the necessity of a specific mention of the term “appurtenances.” Manish v. Potvin,

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        When applying the wait-and-see approach to the rule against perpetuities, the court examines the vesting of an interest at the time the contingency upon which it depends occurs. If the facts as they exist at that time allow for vesting within a life or lives in being plus 21 years, the gift is valid and the various possibilities that may have prevented vesting when viewed at the death of the testator are irrelevant.

        Conveyance in which the transferor’s last name was missing from the acknowledgment (although it appeared elsewhere in the document) and the words “free act and deed” were not included was nonetheless effective upon registration to put a good faith purchaser on notice of the transaction; therefore, the four-year statute of limitations for an effort to have the conveyance set aside as a fraudulent conveyance began to run at that point, and summary judgment was properly entered in favor of the transferee, on timeliness grounds, when such an action was commenced five years after the conveyance.

        Mortgagee was not entitled to bona fide purchaser (BFF) status, as it was charged with constructive notice of a debtor’s adverse claim to property under R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 34-13-2 and 34-13-1. It had knowledge that the debtor conveyed the property for clearly inadequate consideration to the grantee/mortgagor and then remained in possession, it had knowledge that the grantee had signed a prior mortgage covenant in which he declared his intention to reside at the property, and a mortgage broker’s successful effort to prevent an interior inspection should have triggered an obligation of further inquiry.

        Marketable Record Title Act did not apply when plaintiff’s right-of-way in a road was established by a 1953 conveyance to plaintiff’s predecessor in title, where the grantors made an incipient dedication of the road by selling lots with reference to a recorded plat. Plaintiff’s right-of-way did not depend on a reservation in the deed to the 1953 buyers. Bitting v. Gray,

     <p>
      Any person having legal capacity to own land in this state, who has an unbroken chain of title to any interest in land for forty (40) years or more, shall be deemed to have a marketable record title to that interest, subject only to the matters stated in § 34-13.1-3. A person has such an unbroken chain of title when the land records of the town in which the land is located disclose a conveyance or other title transaction, of record not less than forty (40) years at the time the marketability is to be determined, which conveyance or other title transaction purports to create such interest in land, or which contains language sufficient to transfer the interest, either in the person claiming that interest, or some other person from whom, by one or more conveyances or other title transactions of record, the purported interest has become vested in the person claiming the interest; with nothing appearing of record, in either case, purporting to divest the claimant of the purported interest.

      Such marketable record title is subject to: (1) All interest and defects which are created by or arise out of the muniments of which the chain of record title is formed; provided a general reference in the muniments, or any of them, to easements, use restriction, encumbrances or other interests created prior to the root of title are not sufficient to preserve them, unless specific identification is made therein of a recorded title transaction which creates the easement, use restriction, encumbrance or other interest; (2) all interests preserved by the recording of proper notice or by possession by the same owner continuously for a period of forty (40) years or more, in accordance with § 34-13.1-5; (3) the rights of any person arising from a period of adverse possession or use, which was in whole or in part subsequent to the effective date of the root of title; (4) any interest arising out of a title transaction which has been recorded subsequent to the effective date of the root of title from which the unbroken chain of title of record started; provided such recording shall not revive or give validity to any interest which has been extinguished prior to the time of the recording by the operation of § 34-13.1-4; (5) the exceptions stated in § 34-13.1-7 as to rights of reversioners in leases, as to apparent easements and interests in the nature of easements, and as to interests of the United States, this state and political subdivisions thereof, public service companies and natural gas companies; and (6) the rights or interests arising out of any conservation or preservation restriction and or easement, created either: (i) if executed and recorded subsequent to the effective date of chapter 39 of this title entitled “Conservation and Preservation Restrictions on Real Property”, any conservation or preservation easement or restriction granted or reserved in accordance with and pursuant to the terms and provisions thereof; or (ii) if executed and recorded prior to the effective date of chapter 39 of this title, a conservation and/or preservation easement or restriction granted or reserved for the same, or substantially the same, stated purposes as those set forth in § 34-39-2, although executed and recorded prior thereto, and which is held by an entity duly recognized in chapter 39 of this title to hold such restrictions and/or easements.

        The failure by a life tenant to pay taxes on property is not waste where the failure to do so was predicated upon payment by another party in possession who got to the tax collector first and then denied possession to the life tenant; also, since the remainderman has made repairs to the property, the property has not suffered any lasting damage.

        Although the superior court and the family court may have concurrent jurisdiction over the partition of real estate in instances in which divorce or separation proceedings have been commenced, when a complaint for partition is addressed to the superior court under circumstances in which a divorce decree of the family court constitutes an impediment to the partition of the real estate, the superior court either may properly dismiss the complaint without prejudice pending application to the family court for modification of the decree constituting the impediment or, in the alternative, may stay proceedings pending such application by the plaintiff to the family court. However, the superior court may not grant partition as though such decree did not exist. Frazier v. Frazier,

        Upon a bill for partition by tenants in common, the court would not order joinder of mortgagee whose lien extended over the entire tract, such incumbrancer not being a necessary party, as no relief could be decreed against him. Updike v. Adams,

        Trustee in bankruptcy is not a proper party to maintain an action for partition under this section, since it is intended to exclude those who have merely the legal title but are not actually seised or possessed of any estate in their own right. Adelson v. McKenna,

        Tenant in common could enforce partition in equity against co-tenants, where no legal objection existed to complainant’s title, even though the result would work hardship on respondents, as partition in equity is a matter of right and not discretionary. Updike v. Adams,

        Where division by metes and bounds was not practicable, this section did not apply insofar as it made partition between joint tenants a matter of right, and the court had discretion under § 34-15-16 as to whether sale would be decreed. Bianchini v. Bianchini,

        R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-15-12 abrogates the common law right of survivorship in a joint tenancy when an action for partition is pending; when a joint tenant commences a civil action for partition but dies before the case terminates, the statute clearly requires that the action continue to judgment with the heirs or devisees of the decedent, in the same manner as might have been done had the heirs or devisees been original parties in the action.

      If a person named defendant in a complaint for partition, being an inhabitant of this state, is temporarily absent from the state, so that, although it may be known where the person is, the complaint or subpoena cannot be personally served upon him or her, legal service may be made by leaving a copy of the complaint or subpoena with the tenant in possession of the estate whereof partition is demanded, if there is a tenant.

        Hearing justice erred in granting joint tenants’ motion to dismiss a decedent’s partition action without considering the effect of R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-15-12 because the statute abrogated the common law right of survivorship in a joint tenancy when an action for partition was pending; given that the statutory language was clear and unambiguous, the Supreme Court had to interpret the statute literally and had to give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings. Butler v. Gavek,

       <p>
        R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-15-12 abrogates the common law right of survivorship in a joint tenancy when an action for partition is pending; when a joint tenant commences a civil action for partition but dies before the case terminates, the statute clearly requires that the action continue to judgment with the heirs or devisees of the decedent, in the same manner as might have been done had the heirs or devisees been original parties in the action.

       <p>
        Estate’s appeal of an order granting joint tenants’ motion to dismiss a partition action on the ground that the decedent’s demise terminated her interest in a joint tenancy was properly before the Supreme Court because the estate was clearly aggrieved; if the dismissal was upheld, the estate would be left with no interest in the property. Butler v. Gavek,

       </p>
       <p>
        Under R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-15-12, the fact that an executrix was never formally substituted as a party to a decedent’s partition action was not fatal to her ability to appeal from the final judgment of dismissal because the decedent’s decease did not abate her action for partition; thus, her death did not end the litigation, thereby necessitating its “revival” by her estate, since the litigation remained pending.

        To the extent that this section requires that plaintiff in an action to quiet title make an effort to name as defendants all persons who may have adverse claims, this requirement is superseded by Super. Ct. Civ.

In case a temporary order is granted without notice, the motion for a preliminary injunction shall be set down for hearing at the earliest possible time and shall be given precedence over all matters except older matters of the same character; and when the motion comes on for hearing, the party who obtained the temporary restraining order shall proceed with the application for a preliminary injunction, and, if he or she does not do so, the court shall dissolve the temporary restraining order.

The agent shall be a resident of this state or a corporation authorized to do business in this state. The designation shall be in writing and filed with the secretary of state. If no designation is made and filed or if the process cannot be served in this state upon the designated agent, process may be served upon the secretary of state, but service upon the secretary of state is not effective unless the plaintiff or petitioner forthwith mails a copy of the process and pleading by registered or certified mail to the defendant or respondent at his or her last reasonably ascertainable address.

It was not clearly erroneous for the trial court, in determining the fair rental value of the rented premises, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-18-15(b), to refer to the monthly rent the tenant previously paid, and to factor in continuing housing violations. Riley v. Stafford,

       Remedies for abandonment.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If the tenant abandons the dwelling unit, the landlord shall send a certified letter, return receipt requested, to the tenant’s last known address giving notice that unless a reply is received from the tenant within seven (7) days, the landlord shall re-rent the premises. If the notice is returned as undeliverable, or the tenant fails to contact the landlord within seven (7) days, the landlord shall make reasonable efforts to rent the premises at a fair rental. If the landlord rents the dwelling unit for a term beginning before the expiration of the rental agreement, the tenancy terminates as of the date of the new tenancy. If the landlord fails to use reasonable efforts to rent the dwelling unit at fair rental, or if the landlord accepts the abandonment as a surrender, the rental agreement is deemed to be terminated by the landlord as of the date the landlord has notice of the abandonment.

     <p>
      Acceptance of rent with knowledge of a default by the tenant or acceptance of performance by him or her that varies from the terms of the rental agreement constitutes a waiver of the landlord’s right to terminate the rental agreement for that breach, unless the landlord gives written notice within ten (10) days. However, acceptance of partial payment of rent shall not constitute a waiver of the balance due. Acceptance does not waive the landlord’s right to seek remedies for the default.

        Housing authority, who was aware that defendant tenant was in breach of a rental agreement, was estopped from pursuing an eviction action against the tenant for that breach because it accepted rent without a written reservation of rights, even though the tenant had actual notice of the pending eviction action; R.I.

The landlord is trying to evict me because I have exercised my legal rights by calling code enforcement officials, or by taking the following protected action: I have other defenses as follow: WHEREFORE: Because of the defense(s) indicated above, I ask the court to grant a judgment in my favor and not order me to be evicted.

        Trial court did not err in awarding Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) possession of certain premises because FNMA sent a notice of termination of tenancy by sufferance to the owner, the owner’s general appearance constituted a consent to the court’s jurisdiction, the owner failed to rebut the presumption that FNMA was entitled to possession of the property, the trial justice did not err in failing to enforce the owner’s subpoenas, and FNMA had redeemed the title to the property.

Any incorporated homeowners’ association entitled to notice under this section shall have the right to purchase, in the case of a third party bona fide offer to purchase, or to lease in the case of a third party bona fide offer to lease, the land, provided it meets the same price and the same terms and conditions of any offer of which it is entitled to notice under this section by executing a contract or purchase and sale or lease agreement with the owner within one hundred eighty (180) days of notice of the offer. No owner shall attempt to terminate the tenancy of any member of the incorporated homeowners’ association except for nonpayment of rent for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days following a notice of sale or lease under this section. No owner shall unreasonably refuse to enter into, or unreasonably delay the execution of a purchase and sale or lease agreement with a homeowners’ association that has made a bona fide offer to meet the same price and the same terms and conditions of an offer for which notice is required to be given pursuant to this section. Failure of the incorporated homeowners’ association to execute such a purchase and sale agreement or lease within the first one hundred eighty (180) day period shall serve to terminate the right of the association to purchase or lease the land.

Nothing herein shall be construed to require an owner to provide financing to any association or to prohibit an owner from requiring an association which is offering to lease land to have within its possession a sum equivalent to the capitalized value of the proposed rent of the land and requiring that a portion of the sum, of an amount necessary to pay the rent on the land for a period of no greater that two (2) years, be kept in escrow for such purpose during the term of the lease. In the event that an incorporated homeowners’ association accepts an offer under this section, the tenancy of the members of the association shall be extended on a month to month basis until the time set in the offer for closing on the offer.

        Since the statute does not direct the officer as to his course of action if while serving the writ and taking possession of the property a third party appears and claims title to the property, the officer is not liable if it later appears that the property belonged to such third party.

        The conditions of a replevin bond specified in this section are separate and distinct so that a breach of any one is a forfeiture of the bond. It is not necessary in order to bring suit on the bond for the defendant in replevin to make complaint and obtain a judgment where the plaintiff has not prosecuted the action to judgment. Gardiner v.

        A replevin bond signed in the name of the plaintiff by a person without authority to sign does not authorize the service of a writ of replevin, and such a bond cannot be subsequently ratified so as to authorize the maintenance of the action. Smith v. Fisher,

      The officer taking any goods or chattels by virtue of a writ of replevin shall not surrender or deliver the writ to the plaintiff until the amount of the plaintiff’s bond and the sufficiency of the surety shall have been approved by the court to which the writ is returnable. Every officer who shall have served the writ shall make return thereof with his or her doings thereon as soon thereafter as possible to the clerk of the court to which the writ is returnable, and the cause shall then be in order for summary hearing upon the size of the plaintiff’s bond and the sufficiency of his or her surety. The court after notice and hearing shall fix the amount of the plaintiff’s bond and determine the sufficiency of the surety and shall enter its order accordingly. If the plaintiff fails to comply with the order within three (3) days from the entry thereof, the court shall forthwith and without hearing direct the officer in possession of the goods and chattels to return them immediately to the defendant. Thereafter, upon the defendant’s motion, decision shall be for the defendant for his or her damages and costs. Failure of the plaintiff to comply with the order of the court shall also operate as an adjudication of the title to the goods and chattels replevied in favor of the defendant.

        In order to foreclose a mortgage, the right to redeem and file a bill for that purpose must be continuous throughout the three years of possession by the mortgagee, and an agreement between the parties which interrupts the right to redeem necessitates a new entry into possession by the mortgagee for foreclosure pursuant to chapter 27 of this title.

     <p>
      The general assembly finds that predatory lending has become an increasing problem in this state, threatening the viability of many communities and causing decreases in home ownership. While the marketplace may appear to be operating effectively for most home loans, too many homeowners are falling victim to unprincipled creditors who provide loans at exorbitant costs and include terms which are unnecessary to secure repayment of the loan. The general assembly finds that as competition and self-regulation have not eliminated the predatory terms for home-secured loans, the consumer protection provisions of this chapter are necessary to encourage responsible lending.

     </p>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t34c25.2s34-25.2-5ol1a">
       No creditor making a home loan shall finance, directly or indirectly, any credit life, credit disability, credit unemployment or credit property insurance, or any other life or health insurance, or any payments directly or indirectly for any debt cancellation or suspension agreement or contract, except that insurance premiums or debt cancellation or suspension fees calculated and paid in full on a monthly basis shall not be considered financed by the creditor.

      <li id="t34c25.2s34-25.2-5ol1b">
       No creditor shall knowingly or intentionally engage in the unfair act or practice of flipping a home loan. “Flipping a home loan” is the making of a home loan to a borrower that refinances an existing home loan that was consummated within the prior sixty (60) months when the new loan does not have reasonable, tangible net benefit in accordance with subsection 34-25.2-4(q), to the borrower considering all of the circumstances, including, but not limited to, the terms of both the new and refinanced loans, the cost of the new loan, and the borrower’s circumstances.

      <li id="t34c25.2s34-25.2-5ol1c">
       No creditor shall recommend or encourage default on an existing loan or other debt prior to and in connection the closing or planned closing of a home loan that refinances all or any portion of such existing loan or debt.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c25.2s34-25.2-5ol1d">
       No home loan may contain a provision that permits the creditor, in its sole discretion, to accelerate the indebtedness. This provision does not prohibit acceleration of the loan in good faith due to the borrower’s failure to abide by the material terms of the loan.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c25.2s34-25.2-5ol1e">
       No home loan may contain a provision that allows a party to require a borrower to assert any claim or defense in a forum that is less convenient, more, costly, or more dilatory for the resolution of a dispute than a judicial forum established in this state where the borrower may otherwise properly bring a claim or defense or limits in any way claim or defense the borrower may have.

       Limitations and prohibited practices regarding high-cost home loans.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A high-cost home loan shall be subject to the following additional limitations and prohibited practices:
     </p>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t34c25.2s34-25.2-6ol1a">
       In connection with a high-cost home loan, no creditor shall directly or indirectly finance any points or fees which total is greater than five percent (5%) of the total loan amount or eight hundred dollars ($800) whichever is greater.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c25.2s34-25.2-6ol1b">
       No prepayment fees or penalties shall be included in the loan documents for a high-cost home loan.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c25.2s34-25.2-6ol1c">
       No high-cost home loan may contain a scheduled payment that is more than twice as large as the average of earlier scheduled payments. This provision does not apply when the payment schedule is adjusted to the seasonal or irregular income of the borrower.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c25.2s34-25.2-6ol1d">
       No high-cost home loan may include payment terms under which the outstanding principal balance or accrued interest will increase at any time over the course of the loan because the regularly scheduled periodic payments do not cover the full amount of interest due.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c25.2s34-25.2-6ol1e">
       No high-cost home loan may contain a provision that increases the interest rate after default. This provision does not apply to interest rate changes in a variable-rate loan otherwise consistent with the provisions of the loan documents, provided the change in the interest rate is not triggered by the event of default or the acceleration of the indebtedness.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c25.2s34-25.2-6ol1f">
       No high-cost home loan may include terms under which more than two (2) periodic payments required under the loan are consolidated and paid in advance from the loan proceeds provided to the borrower.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c25.2s34-25.2-6ol1g">
       A creditor may not make a high-cost home loan without first receiving certification from a counselor with a third-party nonprofit organization approved by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development that the borrower has received counseling on the advisability of the loan transaction.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c25.2s34-25.2-6ol1h">
       A high-cost home loan shall not be extended to a borrower unless a reasonable creditor would believe at the time the loan is closed that one or more of the borrowers will be able to make the scheduled payments associated with the loan based upon a consideration of his or her current and expected income, current obligations, employment status, and other financial resources, other than the borrower’s equity in the collateral that secures the repayment of the loan. There is a rebuttable presumption that the borrower is able to make the scheduled payments to repay the obligation if, at the time the loan is consummated, said borrower’s total monthly debts, including amounts under the loan, do not exceed fifty percent (50%) of said borrower’s monthly gross income as verified by tax returns, payroll receipts, and other third-party income verification.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c25.2s34-25.2-6ol1i">
       A creditor may not pay a contractor under a home-improvement contract from the proceeds of a high-cost home loan, unless:
       <ol>
        <li id="t34c25.2s34-25.2-6ol1i1">
         The creditor is presented with a signed and dated completion certificate showing that the home improvements have been completed; and
        </li>
        <li id="t34c25.2s34-25.2-6ol1i2">
         The instrument is payable to the borrower or jointly to the borrower and the contractor, or, at the election of the borrower, through a third-party escrow agent in accordance with terms established in a written agreement signed by the borrower, the creditor, and the contractor prior to the disbursement.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t34c25.2s34-25.2-6ol1j">
       A creditor may not charge a borrower any fees or other charges to modify, renew, extend, or amend a high-cost home loan or to defer any payment due under the terms of a high-cost home loan.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c25.2s34-25.2-6ol1k">
       A creditor shall not make available a high-cost home loan that provides for a late payment fee except as follows:
       <ol>
        <li id="t34c25.2s34-25.2-6ol1k1">
         The late payment fee shall not be in excess of three percent (3%) of the amount of the payment past due.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c25.2s34-25.2-6ol1k2">
         The late payment fee shall only be assessed for a payment past due for fifteen (15) days or more or ten (10) days or more in cases of bi-weekly mortgage payment arrangement.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c25.2s34-25.2-6ol1k3">
         The late payment fee shall not be imposed more than once with respect to a single late payment. If a late payment fee is deducted from a payment made on the loan, and the deduction causes a subsequent default on a subsequent payment, no late payment fee may be imposed for the default.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c25.2s34-25.2-6ol1k4">
         A creditor shall treat each payment as posted on the same business day as it was received.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t34c25.2s34-25.2-6ol1l">
       All high-cost home loan documents that create a debt or pledge property as collateral shall contain the following notice on the first page in a conspicuous manner: “Notice: This a high-cost home loan subject to special rules under state law. Purchasers or assignees of this high-cost home loan may be liable for all claims and defenses by the borrower with respect to the home loan.”

        Because a bank was mandated by R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-26-2(a) to discharge a mortgage once the debt was paid in full, and hence could not have assigned the mortgage to a mortgagor, the bank did not violate R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 34-26-4 and 34-26-5 in doing so. As a result, the bank was properly granted summary judgment on the claims filed against it by a mortgagor who sought an assignment of the mortgage.

       Requiring assignment of mortgage in lieu of discharge — Enforcement by incumbrancers.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Where a mortgagor is entitled to redeem, he or she shall by virtue of this section have power to require the mortgagee, instead of discharging or reconveying, and on the terms on which he or she would be bound to discharge or reconvey, to assign the mortgage debt and convey the mortgaged property to such third person as the mortgagor directs; provided, that the mortgagor assumes the expense of making the assignment and conveyance, and obligates himself or herself to have the same recorded, and the fact of the transfer being made shall be prima facie evidence that the assumption of expense and the obligation have been made; and the mortgagee shall, by virtue of this section, be bound, on being relieved of all expense and having the obligation made to him or her, to assign and convey accordingly; and the right shall belong to and be capable of being enforced by each incumbrancer, or by the mortgagor, notwithstanding any intermediate incumbrance, but a requisition of an incumbrancer shall prevail over a requisition of the mortgagor and, as between incumbrancers, a requisition of a prior incumbrancer shall prevail over a requisition of a subsequent incumbrancer. This section does not apply in the case of a mortgagee being or having been in possession.

        Because a bank was mandated by R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-26-2(a) to discharge mortgage once the debt was paid in full, and hence could not have assigned the mortgage to a mortgagor, the bank did not violate R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 34-26-4 and 34-26-5 in doing so. As a result, the bank was properly granted summary judgment on the claims filed against it by a mortgagor who sought an assignment of the mortgage.

The mortgagor shall also be entitled to a reimbursement of reasonable attorney’s fees, if applicable, for the costs incurred by the mortgagor and/or his, her or its attorneys in attempting to obtain a discharge to which the mortgage was lawfully entitled pursuant to the provisions of this section and/or § 34-26-2. Demand for penalties and, if applicable, attorney’s fees and costs pursuant to this section may be made to the department of business regulation, in those instances in which the mortgagee is a regulated institution as defined in Title 19, and the department shall direct such regulated institutions to pay applicable penalties and reimburse effected mortgagors for attorneys fees and costs incurred, on confirmed instances of noncompliance. The department may promulgate rules and regulations governing the processing of such reimbursement. In those instances in which the mortgagee is not a regulated institution as defined in Title 19, the Department shall provide the mortgagor with the name, address and telephone number of the regulatory agency having jurisdiction over the actions of such mortgagees.

        In order to trigger the mortgagee’s duty to discharge, the mortgagor must tender final payment of all amounts owed. The statute does not say that the duty to release arises when the mortgagor offers to tender, or shows an ability to tender. National Credit Union Admin. Bd. v. Regine,

        Because a bank was mandated by R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-26-2(a) to discharge a mortgage once the debt was paid in full, and hence could not have assigned the mortgage to a mortgagor, the bank did not violate R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 34-26-4 and 34-26-5 in doing so. As a result, the bank was properly granted summary judgment on the claims filed against it by a mortgagor who sought an assignment of the mortgage.

        Based on a reading of the plain language of the ancient mortgages statute, § 34-26-7, the period of validity for a 1992 mortgage that stated a term of 10 years, with no maturity date, was 10 years plus five years following expiration of that term; therefore, the superior court properly ruled that the mortgage had been discharged by operation of the statute.

        Although the amended mortgage was recorded, the purported extension of the mortgage set forth in a modification agreement was not recorded in the land evidence records and the modification agreement was the only document that stated the duration of the extension. Thus, the amendment failed to extend the term of the mortgage for the purposes set forth in the ancient mortgages statute, § 34-26-7. Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC v. Providence Bus. Loan Fund, Inc.,

       Statement of policy.  It is hereby declared that residential mortgage foreclosure actions, caused in part by unemployment and underemployment, have negatively impacted a substantial number of homeowners throughout the state, creating a situation that endangers the economic stability of many of the citizens of this state as the increasing numbers of foreclosures lead to increases in unoccupied and unattended buildings and the unwanted displacement of homeowners and tenants who desire to live and work within the state.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c27s34-27-3.2ol1b">
       Purpose.  The statutory framework for foreclosure proceedings is prescribed under the provisions of chapter 27 of this title. As the need for a mortgage mediation process has evolved, it is important for the state to develop a standardized, statewide process for foreclosure mediation rather than a process based on local ordinances that may vary from municipality to municipality. By providing a uniform standard for an early HUD-approved, independent counseling process in owner-occupied principal residence mortgage foreclosure cases, the chances of achieving a positive outcome for homeowners and lenders will be enhanced.

        Adjourned foreclosure sale was lawfully noticed because the mortgagor received proper notice from the mortgagee of the original foreclosure sale, and notice of the adjourned sale was continuously published in the newspaper on a weekly basis, with the last notice appearing the day before the sale actually took place.

        Superior court properly granted summary judgment to a lender in its foreclosure action because the only evidence in the record revealed that the lender did in fact give notice of its foreclosure sale of the property in compliance with the statutory requirements; the borrower’s and owner’s bare assertions otherwise—that there remained genuine issues of material fact and that discovery was ongoing—fell well short of proving by competent evidence the existence of a disputed issue of material fact.

        Trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the bank as the bank did not conduct an illegal foreclosure sale. Despite the trust asserting at oral argument that notice was improper, its written submission to the court was devoid of any mention that the foreclosure sale was improper based on the trust not being notified; and, even if the trust had properly raised the argument that notice was improper in its written submission, that argument lacked merit as the undisputed evidence demonstrated that both mortgagors were mailed written notice of the bank’s intent to foreclose at their last known addresses, in accordance with this section.

The deed shall be captioned “foreclosure deed” and the date of the foreclosure shall be stated in the deed. This subsection (a) shall not apply to any such sale if, prior to the recording of the foreclosure deed: (1) The mortgagor files a voluntary proceeding, or an order for relief is entered in any involuntary proceeding against the mortgagor, under any federal or state bankruptcy or insolvency statute; or (2) The mortgagee abandons or otherwise terminates such sale.

In the event of a violation of subsection (a), taxes due and owing shall be determined as of the date required thereunder for the recording of a foreclosure deed.

     <p>
      The general assembly finds and declares that the uniqueness of the construction industry requires a special system to ensure that payment is received by those businesses, contractors and owners who expend materials and/or labor prior to the completion of a construction project, but then must wait to be made financially compensated for the materials and/or labor. The general assembly also recognizes that once the materials and labor are placed into the building, or other construction project, it is impossible to reclaim the goods or services so that the only means of compensation is to receive monetary payment. In addition, the general assembly finds that the Comprehensive Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2005 expanded § 523(a) of the Uniform Code of chapter 13, and created a new section known as UC Bankruptcy Code 1328 that gives building material suppliers recourse when a contractor, “commits fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity.” Under the new UC Bankruptcy Code 1328, if any person commits fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity, embezzlement, or larceny the debt is nondischargeable under chapter 7 (liquidation), chapter 11 (adjustment of debt) or chapter 13 (reorganization).

        The more reasonable construction of this statute requires the mailing of a copy of a notice of intention to claim the lien to the building inspector as a condition of perfecting the lien, only in the event that the owner’s address is unknown, or in the event that the notice that is mailed to the owner is returned undelivered. When the owner’s address is known and the notice is successfully delivered, the failure to mail to the building inspector does not void the lien. Faraone v. Faraone,

        Trial court did not err in dismissing a subcontractor’s action to enforce a mechanic’s lien because the notary public’s “acknowledgement” in the subcontractor’s notice of intention was insufficient to satisfy the “oath” requirement under to R.I.

        When a subcontractor’s notice of intention to enforce a mechanic’s lien contained a notarial “acknowledgment” rather than “oath,” a trial court did not err in dismissing the subcontractor’s action for failing to comply with R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-28-4 because the oath requirement in § 34-28-4(b) was mandatory, not merely directory; the word “shall” in § 34-28-4(b) connoted the imperative and contemplated the imposition of a duty.

        Because a contract between a general contractor and a subcontractor explicitly prohibited the subcontractor from subcontracting or assigning any of its work without the general contractor’s written permission, and because there was no evidence of a contractual relationship between the subcontractor and a sub-subcontractor, the sub-subcontractor was not entitled to file a mechanic’s lien under R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-28-4; therefore, the lien releases executed by the subcontractor were binding on the sub-subcontractor. Alpha Omega Constr., Inc. v. Proprietors of Swan Point Cemetery,

      Upon filing of the complaint, the clerk of the superior court shall, by one advertisement to be inserted in some public newspaper published in the city or town where the property against which the lien is claimed is located, but, if there shall be no public newspaper published in the city or town, then by one advertisement in some public newspaper published in the county where the property is located, which one advertisement shall, with the service of the citation set forth in § 35-28-15, notify all persons having a lien, by virtue of this chapter, or any title, claim, lease, mortgage, attachment, or other lien or encumbrance, or any unrecorded claim on all or any part of the same property, to respond to the court in accordance with § 34-28-15 and § 34-28-16 and make out their demands against the property; and the clerk shall issue a citation to each person whose name appears on the list, made a part of the complaint by § 34-28-13, of all persons who have any recorded title, claim, lease, mortgage, attachment, or other lien or encumbrance (other than under § 34-28-1, 34-28-2, 34-28-3, or § 34-28-7) on a day certain to respond in accordance with §§ 34-28-15 and 34-28-16 and show cause, if any they have, why the lien should not be allowed and enforced for the amount claimed. The plaintiff shall, at least ten (10) days before the return day of the citation mentioned in § 34-28-15, mail, postage prepaid, a copy of the advertisement provided for in this section (printed, typewritten, or otherwise reproduced) to each person who has filed a notice of intention under § 34-28-4.

        Motion justice committed reversible error when he found that the failure to submit a timely statement of claim was the result of the assignee’s excusable neglect because had the assignee carried out even the most cursory due diligence before it purchased the mortgage, it would have discovered that the property was implicated in the mechanics’ lien action, the assignee purchased an asset that had already lost its priority when it purchased the mortgage, and the assignee’s failure seemed to have been based on its own carelessness, inattention, or willful disregard of the process of the court.

        Rhode Island Mechanics’ Lien Law, as amended by R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-28-17.1 provided due process protections to property owners whose property had been subjected to liens; in ruling the statute had unconstitutionally denied landowners’ federal and Rhode Island constitutional guarantees of due process, the trial court erred in referencing a version of the statute that was no longer in effect.

        Rhode Island Mechanics’ Lien Law, as amended by R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-28-17.1, does not violate due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution or R.I. Const. art. 1, § 2 because, despite the lack of a showing of extraordinary circumstances and ex parte judicial review of an affidavit, the procedural safeguards that R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-28-17.1 employs, primarily the prompt post-deprivation hearing, limits the risk of erroneous deprivation. Gem Plumbing &amp; Heating Co. v. Rossi,

        Mechanics’ lien statute, R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-28-19, makes clear that an award of costs and an award of attorneys’ fees are distinct discretionary acts; thus, even if a hearing justice had intended to affirm an arbitrator’s award of “costs” upon judicial review of an original arbitration award, these costs could not have included attorneys’ fees, therefore, the court erred when it affirmed the arbitration award but, in fact, augmented it by adding costs and attorneys’ fees.

Laws § 34-28-10(a), after the property owner filed a petition to discharge the lien, pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-28-17, and agreed to post a bond; the court did not abuse its discretion by finding that the subcontractor was the prevailing party in its action to enforce its lien or by awarding the subcontractor $ 12,383 in attorneys’ fees.

Gen.

        When a trust’s expansion of the trust’s condominium unit was found to violate R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 34-36-7(b) and 34-36.1-2.17(d), the trust was also properly found liable for breach of contract because the trust’s actions violated an applicable provision of the condominium declaration that mirrored the statutes.

        In a condominium association’s declaratory judgment action, a trial court properly determined that a condominium unit owner was not permitted to rent his unit to a third tenant because the unambiguous condominium declaration clearly stated that a unit could not be rented more than two times in a single calendar year, the owner held individual, month-to-month tenancies with two tenants and, as such, the owner had reached the maximum number of annual rentals that were allowed under the declaration; thus, the owner’s proposed third lease agreement violated the declaration.

Acceptance shall be evidenced by an agreement in writing executed by and in behalf of the condominium association and by all of the owners of all of the individual condominium units within the condominium, in which agreement it is clearly stated that they all accept the provisions of this chapter in lieu of those in the statute under which the condominium was organized and wish to be governed in the future by the provisions of this chapter. The agreement shall be recorded in the land evidence records of each and every town or city where all or any part of the land in the condominium concerned may be located and shall become effective when first so recorded.

         The question of the extent to which a state statute should apply to particular condominiums involves two problems: first, the extent to which the statute should require or permit different results from condominiums created before and after the statute becomes effective; and second, whether the statute should impose any or all of its substantive requirements on condominiums located outside the state.
         <p id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.02-commissionerscommentol11.1">
          Two conflicting policies are proposed when considering the applicability of this Act to “old” and “new” condominiums located in the enacting state. On the one hand, it is desirable, for reasons of uniformity, for the Act to apply to all condominiums located in a particular state, regardless of whether the condominium was created before or after adoption of the Act in that state. To the extent that different laws apply within the same state to different condominiums, confusion results in the minds of both lenders and consumers. Moreover, because of the inadequacies and uncertainties of condominiums created under old law, and because of the requirements placed on declarants and unit owners’ associations by this Act which might increase the costs of new condominiums, different markets might tend to develop for condominiums created before and after adoption of the Act.
         </p>
         <p id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.02-commissionerscommentol11.2">
          On the other hand, to make all provisions of this Act automatically apply to “old” condominiums might violate the constitutional prohibition of impairment of contracts. In addition, aside from the constitutional issue, automatic applicability of the entire Act almost certainly would unduly alter the legitimate expectations of some present unit owners and declarants.
         </p>
         <p id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.02-commissionerscommentol11.3">
          Accordingly, the philosophy of this section reflects a desire to maximize the uniform applicability of the Act to all condominiums in the enacting state, while avoiding the difficulties raised by automatic application of the entire Act to pre-existing condominiums.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.02-commissionerscommentol12">
         In carrying out this philosophy with respect to “new” condominiums, the Act applies to all condominiums “created” within the state after the Act’s effective date. This is the effect of the first sentence of subsection (a). The first sentence of subsection (b) makes clear that the provisions of old statutes expressly applicable to condominiums do not apply to condominiums created after the effective date of this Act.
         <p id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.02-commissionerscommentol12.1">
          “Creation” of a condominium pursuant to this Act occurs upon recordation of a declaration pursuant to Section [34-36.1-2.01]; however, the definition of “condominium” in Section [34-36.1-1.03(7)] contemplates that
          <i>
           de facto
          </i>
          condominiums may exist, if the nature of the ownership interest fits the definition, and the Act would apply to such a condominium. Any real estate project which includes individually owned units and common elements owned by the unit owners as tenants in common is therefore subject to the Act if created within the state after the Act’s effective date. No intent to subject the condominium to the Act is required, and an express intention to the contrary would be invalid and ineffective.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.02-commissionerscommentol13">
         The section adopts a novel three-step approach to condominiums created before the effective date of the Act. First, certain provisions of the Act automatically apply to “old” condominiums, but only prospectively, and only in a manner which does not invalidate provisions of condominium declarations and bylaws valid under “old” law. Second, “old” law remains applicable to previously created condominiums where not automatically displaced by the Act. Third, owners of “old” condominiums may amend any provisions of their declaration or bylaws, even if the amendment would not be permitted by “old” law, so long as (a) the amendment is adopted in accordance with the procedure required by “old” law and the existing declaration and bylaws, and (b) the substance of the amendment does not violate this Act.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.02-commissionerscommentol14">
         Elaboration of the principles described in Comment 3 may be helpful.
         <p id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.02-commissionerscommentol14.1">
          First, the second sentence of subsection (a) provides that the enumerated provisions automatically apply to condominiums created under pre-existing law, even though no action is taken by the unit owners. Many of the sections which do apply should measurably increase the ability of the unit owners to effectively manage the association, and should help to encourage the marketability of condominiums created under early condominium statutes. To avoid possible constitutional challenges, these provisions, as applied to “old” condominiums, apply only to “events and circumstances occurring after the effective date of this Act”; moreover, the provisions of this Act are subject to the provisions of the instruments creating the condominium, and this Act does not invalidate those instruments.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.02-commissionerscommentol15">
         In considering the permissible amendments under subsection (b), it is important to distinguish between the law governing the procedure for amending declarations, and the substance of the amendments themselves. An amendment to the declaration of the condominium created under “old” law, even if permissible under this Act, must nevertheless be adopted “in conformity with the procedures and requirements specified” by the original condominium instruments, and in compliance with the old law.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.02-commissionerscommentol16">
         The last sentence of subsection (b) addresses the potential problem of a declarant seeking to take undue advantage of the amendment provisions to assume a power granted by the Act without being subject to the Act’s limitations on the power. The last sentence insures that, if declarants or other persons assume any of the powers and rights which the Act grants, the correlative obligations, liabilities, and restrictions of the Act also apply to that person, even if the amendment itself does not require that result.

        <li id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.02-commissionerscommentol19">
         This section does not permit a pre-existing condominium to elect to come entirely within the provisions of the Act, disregarding old law. However, the owners of a pre-existing condominium may elect to terminate the condominium under pre-existing law and create a new condominium which would be subject to all the provisions of this Act.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.02-commissionerscommentol110">
         Subsection (c) reflects the fact that there are practical as well as constitutional limits regarding the extent to which a state should or may extend its jurisdiction to out-of-state transactions. A state may, of course, properly exercise its authority to protect its citizens from false or misleading information relating to condominiums located in other states but sold in this state. However, where sale contracts are executed solely outside the enacting state and relate to condominiums located outside the state, it seems more appropriate for the courts of the jurisdiction(s) in which the condominium is located and where the transaction occurs to have jurisdiction over the transaction.

         The first clause of this section permits the defined terms used in the Act to be defined differently in the declaration and bylaws. Regardless of how terms are used in those documents, however, terms have an unvarying meaning in the Act, and any restricted practice which depends on the definition of a term is not affected by a changed term in the documents.

        <li id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.03-commissionerscommentol12">
         The definition of “affiliate of a declarant” (Section [34-36.1-1.03(1)]) is similar to the definitions in
         <cite class="ocri">
          12 U.S.C.
         </cite>
         § 1730(a), which prescribes the authority of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation to regulate the activities of savings and loan holding companies, and in
         <cite class="ocri">
          15 U.S.C.
         </cite>
         § 78(c)(18), which defines persons deemed to be associated with a broker or dealer for purposes of the federal securities laws.
         <p id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.03-commissionerscommentol12.1">
          The objective standards of the definition permit a ready determination of the existence of affiliate status to be made. Unlike
          <cite class="ocri">
           12 U.S.C.
          </cite>
          § 1730(a)(2)(B), no power is vested in an agency to subjectively determine the existence of “control” necessary to establish affiliate status. Thus, affiliate status does not exist under the Act unless these objective criteria are met.

        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.03-commissionerscommentol13">
         Definition (2), “allocated interests,” refers to all of the interests which this Act requires the declaration to allocate. See Section [34-36.1-2.07].
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.03-commissionerscommentol14">
         Definitions (4) and (25) [(28)], treating “common elements” and “units,” should be examined in light of Section [34-36.1-2.02], which specifies in detail how the precise differentiation between units and common elements is to be determined in any given condominium to the extent that the declaration does not provide a different scheme. No exhaustive list of items comprising the common elements is necessary in this Act or in the declaration; as long as the boundaries between units and common elements can be ascertained with certainty, the common elements include by definition all of the real estate in the condominium not designated as part of the units.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.03-commissionerscommentol15">
         Definition (7), “condominium,” makes clear that, unless the ownership interest in the common elements is vested in the owners of the units, the project is not a condominium. Thus, for example, if the common elements were owned by an association in which each unit owner was a member, the project would not be a condominium. Similarly, if a declarant sold units in a building but retained title to the common areas, granting easements over them to unit owners, no condominium would have been created. Such projects have many of the attributes of condominiums, but they are not covered by this Act.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.03-commissionerscommentol16">
         Definition (8), “conversion building,” is important because of the protection which the Act provides in Section [34-36.1-1.10] for tenants of buildings which are being converted into a condominium. The definition distinguishes between buildings which have never been occupied by any person before the time that the building is submitted to the condominium form of ownership, and buildings, whether new or old, which have been previously occupied by tenants. In the former case, because there have been no tenants in the building, the building would not be a conversion building, and no protection of tenants is necessary.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.03-commissionerscommentol17">
         Definition (9), “declarant,” is designed to exclude persons who may be called upon to execute the declaration in order to ratify the creation of the condominium, but who are not intended to be charged with the responsibilities imposed on declarants by this Act if that is all they do. Examples of such persons include holders of pre-existing liens and, in the case of leasehold condominiums, ground lessors. (Of course, such a person could become a declarant by subsequently succeeding to a special declarant right.) Other persons similarly protected by the narrow wording of this definition include real estate brokers, because they do not offer to dispose of their own interest in a unit. Similarly, unit owners reselling their units are not declarants because their units were “previously disposed of ” when originally conveyed.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.03-commissionerscommentol18">
         Definition (11), “development rights,” includes a panoply of sophisticated development techniques that have evolved over time throughout the United States and which have been expressly recognized (and regulated) in an increasing number of jurisdictions, beginning with Virginia in 1974.
         <p id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.03-commissionerscommentol18.1">
          Some of these techniques relate to the phased (or incremental) development of condominiums which the declarant hopes, but cannot be sure, will be successful enough to grow to include more land than he is initially willing to commit to the condominium. For example, a declarant may be building (or converting) a 50-unit building on Parcel A with the intention, if all goes well, to “expand” the condominium by adding an additional building on Parcel B, containing additional units, as part of the same condominium. If he reserves the right to do so,
          <i>
           i. e.,
          </i>
          to “add real estate to a condominium,” he has reserved a “development right.”
         </p>
         <p id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.03-commissionerscommentol18.2">
          In certain cases, however, the declarant may desire, for a variety of reasons, to include both parcels in the condominium from the outset, even though he may subsequently be obliged to withdraw all or part of one parcel. Assume, for example, that in the example just given the declarant intends to build an underground parking garage that will extend into both parcels. If the project is a success, his documentation will be simpler if both parcels were included in the condominium from the beginning. If his hopes are not realized, however, and it becomes necessary to withdraw all or part of Parcel B from the condominium and devote it to some other use, he may do so if he has reserved such a development right “to withdraw real estate from a condominium.” The portion of the garage which extends into Parcel B may be left in the condominium (separated from the remainder of Parcel B by a horizontal boundary), or the garage may be divided between Parcels A and B with appropriate cross-easement agreements.
         </p>
         <p id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.03-commissionerscommentol18.3">
          The right “to create units, common elements, or limited common elements” is frequently useful in commercial or mixed-use condominiums where the declarant needs to retain a high degree of flexibility to meet the space requirements of prospective purchasers who may not approach him until the condominium has already been created. For example, an entire floor of a high-rise building may be intended for commercial buyers, but the declarant may not know in advance whether one purchaser will want to buy the whole floor as a single unit or whether several purchasers will want the floor divided into several units, separated by common element walls and served by a limited common element corridor. This development right is sometimes useful even in purely residential condominiums, especially those designed to appeal to affluent buyers. Similarly, the development rights “to subdivide units or convert units into common elements” is most often of value in commercial condominiums, but can occasionally be useful in certain kinds of residential condominiums as well.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.03-commissionerscommentol19">
         Definition (12) [(13)], “dispose” or “disposition,” includes voluntary transfers to purchasers of any interest in a unit, other than as security for an obligation. Consequently, the grant of a mortgage or other security interest is not a “disposition,” nor is any transfer of any interest to a person who is excluded from the definition of “purchaser,” infra. However, the term includes more than conveyances and would, for example, cover contracts of sale.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.03-commissionerscommentol110">
         Definition (15) [(18)], “leasehold condominium,” should be distinguished from land which is leased to a condominium but not subjected to the condominium regime. A leasehold condominium means, by definition, real estate which has been subjected to the condominium form of ownership. In such a case, units located on the leasehold real estate are typically leased for long terms. At the expiration of such a lease, the condominium unit or the real estate underlying the unit would be removed from the condominium if the lease were not extended or renewed. On the other hand, real estate may not be subjected to condominium ownership, but may be leased directly to the association or to one or more unit owners for a term of years.
         <p id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.03-commissionerscommentol110.1">
          This distinction is very significant. Under Section [34-36.1-3.05], the unit owners’ association is empowered, following expiration of the period of declarant control, to cancel any lease of recreational or parking areas or facilities to which it is a party, regardless of who the lessor is. The association also has the power to cancel any lease for any land if the declarant or an affiliate of the declarant is a party to that lease. If the leased real estate, however, is subjected by the declarant to condominium form of ownership, that lease may not be cancelled unless it is unconscionable or unless the real estate was submitted to the condominium regime for the purpose of avoiding the right to terminate the lease.

          While the subjective test of declarant’s “purpose” may not always be clear, the rights of the association to cancel a lease depend upon the test. Thus, for example, a declarant who wishes to lease a swimming pool to the unit owners would have a choice of subjecting the pool for, say, a term of 20 years to the condominium form of ownership as a common element. At the end of the term, the lease would terminate and the real estate containing the pool would be automatically removed from the condominium unless there were a right to renew the lease. During the 20-year term, the lease would not be cancellable, regardless of the terms, unless it were found to be unconscionable under Section [34-36.1-1.10], or cancellable because submitted for the purpose of avoiding the right to cancel. On the other hand, if the pool were not submitted to the condominium form of ownership and was leased directly to the association for a 20-year term, the association could cancel that lease 90 days after the period of declarant control expired, even if, for example, 18 years remained of the term.

         Definition (20) [(23)], “purchaser,” includes a person who acquires any interest in a unit, even as a tenant, if his tenancy entitles him to occupy the premises for more than 20 years. This would include a tenant who holds a lease of a unit in a fee simple condominium for one year, if the lease entitles the tenant to renew the lease for more than 4 additional years. Excluded from the definition, however, are mortgagees, declarants, and people in the business of selling real estate for their account. Persons excluded from the definition of “purchaser” do not receive certain benefits under Article 4, such as the right to a public offering statement (Section [34-36.1-4.02(c)]) and the right to rescind (Section [34-36.1-4.08] ).

         Definition (21) [(24)], “real estate,” is very broad, and is very similar to the definition of “real estate” in Section 1-201(16) of the Uniform Land Transactions Act.

          Although often thought of in two-dimensional terms, real estate is a three-dimensional concept and the third dimension is unusually important in the condominium context. Where real estate is described in only two dimensions (length and width), it is correctly assumed that the property extends indefinitely above the earth’s surface and downwards toward a point in the center of the planet. In most condominiums, however, as in so-called “air rights” projects, ownership does not extend

          because units are stacked on top of units or units and common elements are interstratified. In such cases the upper and lower boundaries must be identified with the same precision as the other boundaries.

         Definition (23) [(26)], “special declarant rights,” seeks to isolate those rights reserved for the benefit of a declarant which are unique to the declarant and not shared in common with other unit owners. The list, while short, encompasses virtually every significant right which a declarant might seek in the course of creating or expanding a condominium.
         <p id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.03-commissionerscommentol113.1">
          Any person who possesses a special declarant right would be a “declarant”, including any who succeed under Section [34-36.1-3.04] to any of those rights. Thus, the concept of special declarant rights triggers the imposition of obligations on those who possess the rights. Under Section [34-36.1-3.04], those obligations vary significantly, depending upon the particular special declarant rights possessed by a particular declarant. These circumstances are described more fully in the comments to Section [34-36.1-3.04].

         Definition (25) [(28)], “unit,” describes a tangible, physical part of the project, rather than a right in, or claim to, a tangible physical part of the property. Therefore, for example, a “time-share” arrangement in which a unit is sold to 12 different persons each of whom has the right to occupy the unit for one month does not create 12 new units — there are, rather, 12 owners of the unit. (Under the section on voting (Section [34-36.1-2.10]), a majority of the time-share owners of a unit are entitled to cast the votes assigned to that unit.)

          While a separately described part of the project is not a unit unless it is designed for, and is subject to, separate ownership by persons other than the association, the association developer can hold or acquire units unless otherwise provided in the declaration.

         Definition (26) [(29)], “unit owners,” contemplates that a seller under a land installment contract would remain the unit owner until the contract is fulfilled. As between the seller and the buyer, various rights and responsibilities might be assigned to the buyer by the contract itself, but the association would continue to look to the seller (for payment of any arrears in common expense assessments, for example) as long as the seller holds title.
         <p id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.03-commissionerscommentol116.1">
          The definition makes it clear that declarants, so long as they own units in the condominium, are unit owners and are therefore subject to all of the obligations imposed on other unit owners, including the obligation to pay common expense assessments against those units. This provision is designed to resolve ambiguities on this point which have arisen under several existing state statutes.

         The Act is generally designed to provide great flexibility in the creation of condominiums and, to that end, the Act permits the parties to vary many of its provisions. In many instances, however, provisions of the Act may not be varied, because of the need to protect purchasers, lenders, and declarants. Accordingly, this section adopts the approach of prohibiting variation by agreement except in those cases where it is expressly permitted by the terms of the Act itself.

         One of the consumer protections in this Act is the requirement for consent by specified percentages of unit owners to particular actions or changes in the declaration. In order to prevent declarants from evading these requirements by obtaining powers of attorney from all unit owners, or in some other fashion controlling the votes of unit owners, this section forbids the use by a declarant of any device to evade the limitations or prohibitions of the Act or of the declaration.

         The second sentence of the section is an important limitation upon the rights of a declarant. It is the practice in many jurisdictions today, particularly jurisdictions which do not permit expansion of a condominium by statute, for a declarant to secure powers of attorney from all unit purchasers permitting the declarant unilaterally to expand the condominium by “unanimous consent” to include new units and to reallocate common element interests, common expense liability, and votes. With such powers of attorney, many declarants have purported to comply with the typical provision of “first generation” condominium statutes requiring unanimous consent for amendments of the declaration concerning such matters.

          Section [34-36.1-2.17] requires unanimous consent to make certain amendments to the declaration and bylaws. If a declarant were permitted to use powers of attorney to accomplish such changes, the substantial protection which Section [34-36.1-2.17(d)] provides to unit owners would be illusory. Section [34-36.1-1.04] prohibits the declarant from using powers of attorney for such purposes.

         A condominium may be created, by the recordation of a declaration, long before the first unit is conveyed. This happens frequently with existing rental apartment projects which are converted into condominiums. Subsection (d) spares the local taxing authorities from having to assess each unit separately until such time as the declarant begins conveying units, although separate assessment from the date the condominium is created may be permitted under other law. See subsection (d). When separate tax assessments become mandatory under this section, the assessment for each unit must include the value of that unit’s common element interest, and no separate tax bill on the common elements is to be rendered to the association or the unit owners collectively. Any common elements subject to development rights, however, are separately taxed to the declarant.

         Even if real estate subject to development rights is a part of the condominium and lawfully “owned” by the unit owners in common, it is in fact an asset of the declarant, and must not be taxed and assessed against unit owners.

         Unlike the law of New York and perhaps other states, this section imposes no limitation on the power of a jurisdiction to tax the condominium unit based on its fair market value. In most jurisdictions, experience has shown that the conversion of an apartment building to the condominium form of ownership greatly increases the fair market value of that building. Accordingly, a jurisdiction under this Act may impose real estate taxes on condominium units which reflect the fair market value of those units in the same way that the jurisdiction taxes other forms of real estate.

         The first sentence of this section prohibits discrimination against condominiums by local law-making authorities. Thus, if a local law, ordinance, or regulation imposes a requirement which cannot be met if property is subdivided as a condominium but which would not be violated if all of the property constituting the condominium were owned by a single owner, this section makes it unlawful to apply that requirement or restriction to the condominium. For example, in the case of a high-rise apartment building, if a local requirement imposing a minimum number of parking spaces per apartment would not prevent a rental apartment building from being built, this Act would override any requirement that might impose a higher number of spaces per apartment merely by virtue of the same building being owned as a condominium.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.06-commissionerscommentol12">
         The second sentence makes clear that, except for the prohibition on discrimination against condominiums, the Act has no effect on real estate use laws. For example, a particular piece of real estate submitted to the condominium form of ownership might be of such size that all of the real estate is required to support a proposed density of units or to satisfy minimum setback requirements. Under this Act, part of the submitted real estate might be subject to a development right entitling the declarant to withdraw it from the condominium, but the mere reservation of this right would not constitute a subdivision of the parcel into separate ownership. If a declarant or foreclosing lender at a later time sought to exercise the option to withdraw the real estate, however, withdrawal would constitute a subdivision and would be illegal if the effect of withdrawal would be to violate setback requirements, or to exceed the density of units permitted on the remaining parcel.

         The provisions of this statute are not intended to supplant the usual rules of eminent domain but merely to supplement the rules to address the unique problems which eminent domain raises in the context of a condominium. Nevertheless, because the law of eminent domain differs widely among the various states, the law of each state should be reviewed to ensure that the eminent domain code and this section are properly integrated.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.07-commissionerscommentol12">
         When a unit is taken or partially taken by eminent domain, this section provides for a recalculation of the allocated interests of all units.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.07-commissionerscommentol13">
         An important issue raised by this section is whether or not a governmental body acquiring a unit by eminent domain has a right to also take that unit’s allocated interests and thereby assume membership in the association by virtue of its power of eminent domain. While there is no question that a governmental body may acquire any real property by eminent domain, there is no case law on the question of whether or not the governmental body may take a condominium unit as a part of the condominium or must take the unit and have the unit excluded from the condominium.
         <p id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.07-commissionerscommentol13.1">
          Subsection (a) merely requires that the taking body compensate the unit owner for all of his unit and its interest in the common elements, whether or not the common element interest is acquired. The Act also requires that the allocated interests are automatically reallocated upon taking to the remaining units unless the decree provides otherwise. Whether or not the decree may constitutionally provide otherwise in the case of a particular taking (for example, by allocating the common element interest, votes, and common expense liability to the government) is an unanswered question.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.07-commissionerscommentol14">
         In the circumstances of a taking of part of a unit, it is important to have some objective test by which to measure the portion of allocated interest to be reallocated. Subsection (b) sets forth a formula based on relative size, but permits the declaration to vary that formula to some other more appropriate formula in a particular circumstance. This right to vary the formula in the declaration is important, since it is clear that the formula set forth in the statute may in some instances result in gross inequities.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.07-commissionerscommentol15">
         Even before the amendment formally acknowledging the reallocation of percentages required by this section is recorded, the reallocation is deemed to have occurred simultaneously with the taking. This rule is necessary to avoid the hiatus that otherwise could occur between the taking and reallocation of interests, votes, and liabilities.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIs34-36.1-1.07-commissionerscommentol16">
         Subsection (c) provides that, if part of the common elements is acquired, the award is paid to the association. This would not normally be the rule in the absence of such a provision.

        This section sets forth a basic principle running throughout this Act: in condominium transactions, good faith is required in the performance and enforcement of all agreements and duties. Good faith, as used in this Act, means observance of two standards, “honesty in fact” and observance of reasonable standards of fair dealing. While the term is not defined, the term is derived from and used in the same manner as in Section 1-201 of the Uniform Simplification of Land Transfers Act, and Sections [6A-2-103(1)(b)] and [6A-7-404] of the Uniform Commercial Code.

         A condominium is created pursuant to this Act only by recording a declaration. As with any instrument affecting real estate, the declaration must be recorded in every recording district in which any portion of the condominium is located and must be indexed in the manner described in subsection (a). Specific indexing rules are suggested in brackets and should be used in those states where this result would not otherwise occur. For example, the declaration commonly has not been indexed in the grantee’s index in the name of the condominium. Moreover, when multiple persons execute the declaration, the declaration has often been indexed solely in the name of the declarant and not in the name, for example, of lenders and other persons who might have executed the declaration. Because it is important that the names of the association and all persons executing the declaration appear in the index in order to locate all instruments in the land records, that language is not included in brackets.

         In Section [34-36.1-1.03], the Act defines the term “Declaration” as any instruments, however denominated, which create a condominium, and any amendments to those instruments. “Condominium,” in turn, is defined as “real estate, portions of which are designated for separate ownership and the remainder of which is designated for common ownership solely by the owners of those portions.” It is important to emphasize that other covenants, conditions or restrictions applicable to the real estate in the condominium might be recorded before or after the instruments are recorded which divide the real estate into units and common elements, thereby creating the condominium.

         A condominium has not been lawfully created unless the requirements of this section have been complied with. Nevertheless, a project which meets the definition of “condominium” in Section [34-36.1-1.03(7)] is subject to this Act even if this or other sections of the Act have not been complied with.

         Mortgagees and other lienholders need not execute the declaration, and foreclosure of a mortgage or other lien will not, of itself, terminate the condominium. However, if that lien is prior to the declaration itself, the lienholder may exclude that real estate from the condominium. See Sections [34-36.1-2.18(i) and (j)]. Moreover, the declarant may wish to obtain agreements from mortgagees or other lienholders that they will give partial releases permitting lien-free conveyance of the condominium units. See Section [34-36.1-4.11(a)].

        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.01-commissionerscommentol15">
         Except when development proceeds pursuant to Section 5-103 [Not enacted in Rhode Island], this Act contemplates that two different stages of construction must be reached before (1) a condominium may be created or (2) a unit in the condominium may be conveyed. These stages are described, respectively, in subsection (b) and Section [34-36.1-4.20]. The purpose of imposing these requirements is to insure that a purchaser will in fact take title to a unit which may be used for its intended purpose.
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.01-commissionerscommentol15.1">
          If a condominium were said to consist from the beginning of a certain number of units, even though some of those units had not yet been completed or even begun, serious problems would arise if the remaining units were never constructed and if no obligation to complete the construction could be enforced against any solvent person. If the insolvent owner of the unbuilt units failed to pay his common expense assessments for example, the unit owners’ association might be left with no remedy except a lien of doubtful value against mere cubicles of airspace. Moreover, votes in the unit owners’ association could be assigned to units, and those votes could be cast, even though the units were never built. The Act therefore requires that significant construction take place before units are assigned an interest in the common elements, a vote in the association, and a share of the common expense liabilities, and before units are conveyed. This requirement of substantial completion (or the alternative bonding procedure and other assurances required by Section 5-103 [Not enacted in Rhode Island]) reduces the possibility that a failure to complete will upset the expectations of purchasers or otherwise harm their interests in case the declarant becomes insolvent and no solvent person has the obligation to complete the unit.

         Section [34-36.1-2.01(b)] requires that “all structural components and mechanical systems of all buildings containing or comprising any units” which will be created by recording a declaration, must be substantially completed in accordance with the plans. The intent of subsection (b) is that if any buildings are depicted on the plats and plans which are required by Section [34-36.1-2.09], and these buildings contain or comprise spaces which become units by virtue of recording the declaration, the structural components and mechanical systems of these buildings must be substantially complete before the declaration is recorded. This is required even though the plats and plans recorded pursuant to Section [34-36.1-2.09] depict only the boundaries of the buildings and the units created in those buildings, and not the structural components or mechanical systems (which need not be shown). If the boundaries of units are not depicted, of course, then no units are created. If the declarant fails to comply with this section, title is not affected. See Comment 8, below.
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.01-commissionerscommentol16.1">
          The concept of “structural components and mechanical systems” is one commonly understood in the construction field and this comment is not intended as a comprehensive list of those components. For example, however, the term “structural components” is generally understood to include those portions of a building necessary to keep any part of the building from collapsing, and to maintain the building in a weathertight condition. This would include the foundations, bearing walls and columns, exterior walls, roof, floors and similar components. It would clearly not include such components as interior non-bearing partitions, surface finishes, interior doors, carpeting, and the like. Similarly, typical examples of “mechanical systems” include the plumbing, heating, air conditioning and other like systems. Whether or not “electrical systems” are included within the meaning of the term depends on local practice.

        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.01-commissionerscommentol17">
         Section [34-36.1-4.20], requires that, before an individual unit is conveyed, the unit must be “substantially completed.” “Substantial completion” is a well understood term in the construction industry. For example, the American Institute of Architects Document A201, General Conditions of the Contract for Construction (1976 Ed.) at para. 8.1.3, states:
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.01-commissionerscommentol17.1">
          The Date of Substantial Completion of the Work . . . is the date certified by the Architect when construction is sufficiently complete, in accordance with the Contract Documents (that is, the owner-contractor agreement, the conditions of the contract, and the specifications and all addenda and modifications), so the Owner can occupy or utilize the Work . . . for the use for which it is intended.
         </p>
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.01-commissionerscommentol17.2">
          This standard is also one often used by building officials in issuing certificates of occupancy. It does not suggest that the unit is “entirely completed” as that term is understood in the construction industry; lesser details, such as sticking doors, leaking windows, or some decorative items, might still remain, and the Act contemplates that they need not be completed prior to lawful conveyance.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.01-commissionerscommentol18">
         Sections [34-36.1-2.01(b)] and [34-36.1-4.20] require that completion certificates be recorded, or local certificates of occupancy be issued, as evidence of the fact that the required levels of construction have been met. In the case of “substantial completion,” issuance of “a certificate of occupancy authorized by law,” as is commonly required by local ordinance or state building codes, will suffice. Once the certificates have been recorded, or issued, as the case may be, good title to the units may be conveyed in reliance on the record. It is possible, of course, that the declarant may have failed to complete the required levels of construction; the architect, surveyor or engineer (whichever is appropriate in a particular jurisdiction) may have filed a false certificate. Such acts would create a cause of action in the purchaser under Section [34-36.1-4.15], but would not affect the validity of the purchasers’ title to the condominium.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.01-commissionerscommentol19">
         The requirement of “substantial completion” does not mean that the declarant must complete all buildings in which all possible units would be located before creating the condominium. If only some of the buildings in which units which may ultimately be located have been “structurally” completed, the declarant may create a condominium in which he reserves particular development rights (Section [34-36.1-2.05(a)(8)]). In such a project, only the completed units might be treated as units from the outset, and the development rights would be reserved to create additional units, either by adding additional real estate and units to the condominium, by creating new units on common elements, or by subdividing units previously created. The optional units may never be completed or added to the condominium; however, this will not affect the integrity of the condominium as originally created.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.01-commissionerscommentol110">
         Requiring “substantial completion” of the structural components and mechanical systems in the buildings containing or comprising the units in a condominium may encourage creation of more phased condominiums under Section [34-36.1-2.05] in projects which once were in fact built in phases, but under a single nonexpandable declaration. Experience in the several states where significantly more rigorous requirements are imposed by statute, however, has shown that this does not create a difficult situation either for the developer or the lender. Moreover, it appears likely that the size of the initial phase of a multi-building project will be dictated largely by economics, as occurs in most jurisdictions today, rather than this Act. Finally, many lenders and developers are increasingly sensitive to the secondary mortgage market requirements particularly those of the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC). Experience indicates that the pre-sale requirements imposed by FNMA and FHLMC frequently dictate that multi-building condominium projects be structured on a phased or expandable condominium basis.

        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.01-commissionerscommentol111">
         The requirement of completion would be irrelevant in some types of condominiums, such as campsite condominiums or some subdivision condominiums where the units might consist of unimproved lots, and the airspace above them, within which each purchaser would be free to construct or not construct a residence. Any residence actually constructed would ordinarily become a part of the “unit” by the doctrine of fixtures, but nothing in this Act would require any residence to be built before the lots could be treated as units.

        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.01-commissionerscommentol112">
         The term “independent” architect, surveyor or engineer in subsection (b) and elsewhere in the Act distinguishes any such professional person who acts as an independent contractor in his relationship to the declarant or lender.

         It is important for title purposes and other reasons to have a clear guide as to precisely which parts of a condominium constitute the units and which parts constitute the common elements. This section fills the gap left when the declaration merely defines unit boundaries in terms of floors, ceilings, and perimetric walls.
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.02-commissionerscommentol11.1">
          The provisions of this section may be varied, of course, to the extent that the declarant wishes to modify the details for a particular condominium.

          For example, in a townhouse project structured as a condominium, it may be desirable that the boundaries of the unit constitute the exterior surfaces of the roof and exterior walls, with the center line of the party walls constituting the perimetric boundaries of the units in that plane, and the undersurface of the bottom slab dividing the unit itself from the underlying land. Alternatively, the boundaries of the units at the party walls might be extended to include actual division of underlying land itself. In those cases it would not be appropriate for walls, floors and ceilings to be designated as boundaries, and the declaration would describe the boundaries in the above manner. The differentiations made clear here, in conjunction with the provisions of Section [34-36.1-3.07], will assist in minimizing disputes which have historically arisen in association administration with respect to liability for repair of such things as pipes, porches and other components of a building which unit owners may expect the association to pay for and which the association may wish to have repaired by unit owners. Problems which may arise as a result of negligence in the use of components — such as stoops and pipes — are resolved by Section [34-36.1-3.07], which imposes liability on the unit owner who causes damage to common elements, or under the broader provisions of Section [34-36.1-3.15(e)], which permits the association to assess common expenses “caused by the misconduct of any unit owner” exclusively against that owner. This would include, of course, not only damages to common elements, but fines or unusual service fees, such as cleanup costs, incurred as a result of the unit owner’s misuse of common elements.

         The differentiation between components constituting common elements and components which are part of the units is particularly important in light of Section [34-36.1-3.07(a)], which (subject to the exceptions therein mentioned) makes the association responsible for upkeep of common elements and each unit owner individually responsible for upkeep of his unit.

         The differentiation between unit components and common element components may or may not be important for insurance purposes under this Act. While the common elements in a project must always be insured, the units themselves need not be insured by the association unless the project contains units divided by horizontal boundaries; see Section [34-36.1-3.13(b)]. In a “high rise” configuration, however, Section [34-36.1-3.13(a)] contemplates that both will normally be insured by the association (exclusive of improvements and betterments in individual units) and that the cost of such insurance will be a common expense. That common expense may be allocated, however, on the basis of risk if the declaration so requires. See Section [34-36.1-3.15(c)(3)].

         Subsection (b) does not totally invalidate the rule against perpetuities as applied to condominiums. The language does provide that the rule against perpetuities is ineffective as to documents which would govern the condominium during the entire life of the project, regardless of how long that should be. With respect to deeds or devises of units, however, the policies underlying the rule against perpetuities continue to have validity and remain applicable under this Act.

         In considering the effect of failures to comply with this Act on title matters, subsection (d) refers only to defects in the declaration — which includes the plats and plans — because the declaration is the instrument which creates and defines the units and common elements. No reference is made to other instruments, such as bylaws, because these instruments have no impact on title, whether or not recorded. However, in all cases of violations of the Act, a failure of the bylaws — or any other instrument — to comply with the Act, would entitle any affected persons to appropriate relief under Section [34-36.1-4.17].

         No special prohibition against racial or other forms of discrimination is included in this Act because the provisions of generally applicable federal and state law apply as much to condominiums as to other forms of real estate.

         Some examples may help to clarify what sorts of defects in the declaration are to be regarded as “insubstantial” within the meaning of the first sentence of subsection (d).
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.03-commissionerscommentol14.1">
          Suppose the declaration allocates common element interests to all the units, but fails to indicate the formula for the allocation as required by Section [34-36.1-2.07]. This would be a substantial defect if the assigned interests were unequal, but if all units were assigned identical interests it would be possible to infer that the basis of allocation was equality — and the failure of the declaration to say so would be an insubstantial defect. Were this to happen in a condominium where the right to add new units is reserved, however, it should be noted that a subsequent amendment to the declaration adding new units could not use any formula other than equality for reallocating the common element interests unless a different formula were specified pursuant to Section [34-36.1-2.07(b)].

         <p id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.03-commissionerscommentol14.2">
          Other examples of insubstantial defects that might occur include failure of the declaration to include the word “condominium” in the name of the project, as required by Section [34-36.1-2.05(a)(1)], or failure of the plats and plans to comply satisfactorily with the requirement of Section [34-36.1-2.09(a)] that they be “clear and legible,” so long as they can at least be deciphered by persons with proper expertise. Failure to organize the unit owners’ association at the time specified in Section [34-36.1-3.01] would not be a defect in the declaration at all, and would not affect the validity or marketability of titles in the condominium. It would, however, be a violation of this Act, and create a claim for relief under Section [34-36.1-4.17].

         Many statutes and other regulatory schemes in the multi-owner project field do not separate the functions of a recorded declaration and unrecorded public offering statements or disclosure documents. As a result, many of the developer’s representations and assurances concerning his future plans must appear in the declaration as well as the public offering statement, even though they may have nothing to do with the legal structure or title of the project. See e.g., Section 47-70, Conn.Gen.Stat. (1980). This results in duplicative requirements and unnecessarily complex declarations.
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.05-commissionerscommentol11.1">
          This Act seeks functionally to distinguish between the declaration and the public offering statement. It requires the declaration to contain only those matters which affect the legal structure or title of the condominium. This includes the reserved powers of the declarant to exercise development rights within the condominium. A narrative description of those rights, however, and the possible consequences flowing from their exercise, are required to be disclosed only in the public offering statement and not in the declaration.

         This section requires a statement of the name of the association for the condominium as well as the name of the condominium itself, in order that the declaration may be indexed in the name of the association. See Section [34-36.1-2.01].

         Paragraph (a)(5) requires the declarant to state the largest number of units he reserves the right to build. Unlike many current condominium statutes, this Act imposes no time limit, measured by an absolute number of years, at the expiration of which the declarant must relinquish control of the association. Instead, declarant control ends when 75% of the maximum number of units which may be created by the declarant have been sold, or at the end of a 2-year period during which development is not proceeding. See Section [34-36.1-3.03(d)]. The flexibility afforded by this section may be important to a declarant as he responds to unanticipated future changes in his market.
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.05-commissionerscommentol14.1">
          In theory, a declarant might overstate the maximum number of units in an attempt to artificially extend the period of declarant control, since the time might never come when a declarant had sold 75% of that number of units. As a practical matter, however, such a practice would not likely achieve long-term control.

         Paragraph (a)(5) requires that the boundaries of each unit created by the declaration be identified. The words “created by the declaration” emphasize that in an expandable project, new units may be created in the future by amendments to the declaration. Until those new units are actually added to the project by amending the declaration, however, they are not units within the meaning of that defined term, and they need not be described.

         Section [34-36.1-2.02] makes it possible in many projects to satisfy paragraph (a)(5) of this section by merely providing the identifying number of the units and stating that each unit is bounded by its ceiling, floor, and walls. The plats and plans will show where those ceilings, floors, and perimetric walls are located, and Section [34-36.1-2.02] provides all other details, except to the extent the declaration may make additional or contradictory specifications because of the unique nature of the project.

         Paragraph (a)(6) makes clear that the limited common elements described in Section [34-36.1-2.02(2) and (4)] need not be described in the declaration. These limited common elements are typically porches, balconies, patios, or other amenities which may be included in a project. Such improvements are treated by the Act as limited common elements, rather than either common elements or parts of units, in order to minimize the attention which the documents need to give them, and to secure the result that would be desired in the usual case. Thus, if these improvements remain limited common elements, and no special provisions concerning them are included in the declaration, they may be used only by the units to which they are physically attached; maintenance of those improvements must be paid for by the association; and such improvements need not be specially referred to in the declaration. Porches, balconies and patios must be shown on the plats and plans (see Section [34-36.1-2.09(b)(10)]), but other limited common elements described in Section [34-36.1-2.02(2) and (4)] need not be shown.

        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.05-commissionerscommentol18">
         Paragraph (a)(7) contemplates that the common elements in the project may be allocated as limited common elements at some future time, either by the declarant or the association. For example, a swimming pool might serve an entire project during early phases of development. At the outset, that pool might be a common element which all the unit owners may use. At a later time, with more units and additional pools built in subsequent phases, either the declarant or the association might determine that the first pool should become a limited common element reserved for the use only of units in the first phase, while the other pools should be reserved exclusively for units in the subsequent phases. Such a potential allocation should be described in the declaration pursuant to this section.

        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.05-commissionerscommentol19">
         Paragraph (a)(8) requires the declaration to describe all development rights and other special declarant rights which the declarant reserves. The declaration must describe the real estate to which each right applies, and state the time limit within which each of those rights must be exercised. The Act imposes no maximum time limit for the exercise of those rights, and the particular language of a declaration will vary from project to project depending on the requirements of each project. This Act contemplates that those rights may be exercised after the period of declarant control terminates.

         This section sets out requirements concerning leasehold condominiums which are not typically contained in the statutes of most states. In particular, it requires that the declaration describe the rights of the unit owners, or state that they have no rights concerning a variety of significant matters. The section also contains a number of other consumer protection provisions. However, in contrast to the result under some states’ laws, unit owners have no statutory right to renewal of a lease upon termination.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.06-commissionerscommentol14">
         The most significant matter of consumer protection in this section is subsection (b), which provides that unit owners who pay their share of the rent of the underlying lease may not be deprived of their enjoyment of the leasehold premises.
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.06-commissionerscommentol14.1">
          Subsection (b) is intended to protect the “unit owner” regardless of whether he is a lessee, sublessee, or even further down in a chain of transfer of leasehold interests. Thus, for example, if the “unit owner” is a sublessee, the term “lessor (or) his successor in interest” includes not only the lessor, but also the lessee.
         </p>
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.06-commissionerscommentol14.2">
          Subsection (b) further protects the unit owner by assuring that he will not share with his fellow unit owners any collective obligations toward their common lessor. All obligations are instead fractionalized so that no unit owner can be made liable or otherwise penalized for a default by any of his fellows. Thus, a default by the association in payment of the rent due the lessor, in a case where the lease of common elements ran to the association, would not permit the lessor to terminate continued use of those common elements by those unit owners who then pay their share of the rent.

        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.06-commissionerscommentol15">
         Subsection (d) considers the problems created when termination of a lease reduces the size of a condominium. In the event that some units are thereby withdrawn from the condominium, reallocation of the allocated interests would be required; the section describes how that reallocation would occur.

Unless the executive board determines within thirty (30) days, that the reallocations are unreasonable, the association shall prepare an amendment that identifies the units involved, states the reallocations, is executed by those unit owners, contains words of conveyance between them, and upon recordation, is indexed in the name of the grantor and the grantee.

       </h4>
       <ol>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.07-commissionerscommentol11">
         Most existing condominium statutes require a single common basis, usually related to the “value” of the units, to be used in the allocation of common element interests, votes in the association, and common expense liabilities. This Act departs radically from such requirements by permitting each of these allocations to be made on different bases, and by permitting allocations which are unrelated to value.
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.07-commissionerscommentol11.1">
          Thus, all three allocations might be made equally among all units, or in proportion to the relative size of each unit, or on the basis of any other formula the declarant may select, regardless of the values of those units. Moreover, “size” might be used, for example, in allocating common expenses and common element interests, while equality is used in allocating votes in the association. This section does not require that the formulas used by the declarant be justified, but it does require that the formulas be explained. The sole restriction on the formulas to be used in these allocations is that they not discriminate in favor of the units owned by the declarant. Otherwise, each of the separate allocations may be made on any basis which the declarant chooses, and none of the allocations need be tied to any other allocation.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.07-commissionerscommentol12">
         While the flexibility permitted in allocations is broader than that permitted by any present statutes, it is likely that the traditional bases for allocation will continue to be used, and that the allocations for all allocated interests will often be based on the same formulas. Most commonly, those bases include size, equality, or value of units. Each of these is discussed below.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.07-commissionerscommentol13">
         If size is chosen as a basis of allocation, the declarant must choose between reliance on area or volume, and the choice must be indicated in the declaration. The declarant might further refine the formula by, for example, excluding unheated areas from the calculation or by partially discounting such areas by means of a ratio. Again, the declarant must indicate the choices he has made and explain the formulas he has chosen.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.07-commissionerscommentol14">
         Most existing condominium statutes require that “value” be used as the basis of all allocations. Under this Act a declarant is free to select such a basis if he wishes to do so. For example, he might designate the “par value” of each unit as a stated number of dollars or points. However, the formula used to develop the par values of the various units would have to be explained in the declaration. For example, the declaration for a high-rise condominium might disclose that the par value of each unit is based on the relative area of each unit on the lower floors, but increases by specified percentages at designated higher levels. The formula for determining area in this example could be further refined in the manner suggested in Comment 2, above, and any other factors (such as the direction in which a unit faces) could also be given weight so long as the weight given to each factor is explained in the declaration.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.07-commissionerscommentol15">
         The purpose of subsection (b) is to afford some advance disclosure to purchasers of units in the first phase of a flexible condominium of how common element interests, votes and common expense liabilities will be reallocated if additional units are added.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.07-commissionerscommentol16">
         Subsection (e) means what it says when it states that a lien or encumbrance on a common element interest without the unit to which that common element interest is allocated is void. Thus, consider the case of a flexible condominium in which there are 50 units in the first phase, each of which initially has a 2 percent undivided interest in the common elements. The declarant borrows money by mortgaging additional real estate. When the declarant expands the condominium by adding phase 2 containing an additional 50 units, he reallocates the common element interests in the manner described in his original declaration, to give each of the 100 units a 1 percent undivided interest in the common elements in both phases of the condominium. At this point, the construction lender cannot have a lien on the undivided interest of phase 1 owners in the common elements of phase 2 because of the wording of the statute. Thus, the most that the construction lender can have is a lien on the phase 2 units together with their common element interests. The mortgage documents may be written to reflect the fact that upon the addition of phase 2 of the condominium, the lien on the additional real estate will be converted into a lien on the phase 2 units and on the common element interest as they pertain to those units in both phase 1 and phase 2; however, see Comment to Section [34-36.1-2.10].
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.07-commissionerscommentol16.1">
          Unless the lender also requires phase 2 to be designated as withdrawable real estate, the phase 2 portion may not be foreclosed upon other than as condominium units and the construction lender may not dispose of phase 2 other than as units which are a part of the condominium. In the event that phase 2 is designated as withdrawable land, then the construction lender may force withdrawal of phase 2 and dispose of it as he wishes, subject to the provisions of the declaration. If one unit in phase 2, however, has been sold to anyone other than the declarant, then phase 2 ceases to be withdrawable land by operation of Section [34-36.1-2.10(d)(2)].

         If a unit owned only by the declarant — as opposed to the same unit if owned by another person — may be subdivided into 2 or more units but cannot be converted in whole or in part into common elements, it is still a unit that may be subdivided or converted into 2 or more units or common elements, within the meaning of the definition of development rights, and is not governed by Section [34-36.1-2.13] (Subdivision of Units).

         Subsection (c) represents a significant departure from practice in most states concerning the allocation of votes. The usual rule is that a single allocation of votes is made to each unit, and that allocation applies to all matters on which those votes may be cast. This section recognizes that the increasingly complex nature of some projects requires different allocation on particular questions. It may be appropriate, for example, in a project where common expense liabilities, or questions concerning rules and regulations, affect different units differently.

         This section recognizes that there may be certain instances in which class voting in the association would be desirable. For example, in a mixed-use condominium consisting of both residential and commercial units, there may be certain kinds of issues upon which the residential or commercial unit owners should have a special voice, and the device described in Comment 9 was not desired. To prevent abuse of class voting by the declarant, subsection (c) permits class voting only with respect to specified issues directly affecting the designated class and only insofar as necessary to protect valid interests of the designated class.

        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.07-commissionerscommentol110">
         The last clause of subsection (c) prohibits a practice common in the planned community or other non-condominium multi-ownership projects, where units owned by declarant constitute a separate class of units for voting and other purposes. Upon transfer of title, those units lose these more favorable voting rights. This section makes clear that the votes and other attributes of ownership of a unit may not change by virtue of the identity of the owner. In those circumstances which such classes were legitimately intended to address, principally control of the association, the Act provides other, more balanced devices for declarant control. See Section [34-36.1-3.03(d)].

         Like all other common elements, limited common elements are owned in common by all unit owners. The use of a limited common element, however, is reserved to less than all of the unit owners. Unless the declaration provides otherwise, the association is responsible for the upkeep of a limited common element and the cost of such upkeep is assessed against all the units. See Sections [34-36.1-3.07(a)] and [34-36.1-3.15(c)(1)]. This might include the costs of repainting all shutters, or balconies, for example, which are limited common elements pursuant to Section [34-36.1-2.02(4)]. Accordingly, there may be occasions where, to meet the expectations of owners and to have costs borne directly by those who benefit from those amenities, the declaration might provide that the costs will be borne, not by all unit owners as part of their common expense assessments, but only by the owners to which the limited common elements are assigned.

         Even common elements which are not “limited” within the meaning of this Act may nevertheless be restricted by the unit owners’ association pursuant to the powers set forth in Section [34-36.1-3.02(6) and (10)], unless that power is limited in the declaration. For example, the association might assign reserved parking spaces to designated unit owners, or even to persons who are not unit owners. Such a parking space would differ from a limited common element in that its use would be merely a personal right of the person to whom it is assigned and this section would not have to be complied with to allocate it or to reallocate it.

         Because a mortgage or deed of trust may restrict the borrower’s right to transfer the use of a limited common element without the lender’s consent, the terms of the encumbrance should be examined to determine whether the lender’s consent or release is needed to transfer that right of use to another person.

         The terms “plat” or “plan” have been given a variety of meanings by custom and usage in the various jurisdictions. Under this Act, it is important to recognize that a “plat” need not mean a “survey” of the entire real estate constituting a project at the time the initial plat is recorded, although, through amendments to the plat as development proceeds, it ultimately becomes a survey of the entire project.
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.09-commissionerscommentol11.1">
          As to “plan,” the Act does not use that term to mean the actual building plans used for construction of the project. Instead, the required content of the plans in this Act is described in subsection (d). Essentially, the plans constitute a boundary survey of each unit. Typically, the walls will be the vertical (“up and down” or “perimetric”) boundaries, and the floors and ceilings will be the horizontal boundaries. Importantly, these boundaries need not be physically measured, but may instead be projected from the plat or from actual building construction plans. Thus, the plans under this Act are not conceived to be “as built” plans.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.09-commissionerscommentol12">
         Subsection (c) permits, but does not require, the plats to show the location of contemplated improvements. Since construction of contemplated improvements by a declarant involves the exercise of development rights, a declarant may not create any improvement within real estate where no development rights have been reserved, unless the plats actually show that proposed improvement or unless the association (which the declarant may control) makes the improvement pursuant to Section [34-36.1-3.02(7)]. Should the association attempt that improvement, in the face of unit owner’s objections, it may involve risk of challenge. Within land subject to development rights, of course, construction may take place in accordance with the reserved rights, even if no contemplated improvements are shown on the plats. As to the declarant’s obligation to complete an improvement that is shown, see Section [34-36.1-4.19(a)].
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.09-commissionerscommentol13">
         As noted in the Comments to Section [34-36.1-2.01], a condominium unit may consist of unenclosed ground and/or airspace, with no “building” involved. If this were true of all units in a particular condominium, the provisions of Section [34-36.1-2.09] relating to plans (but not plats) would be inapplicable.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.09-commissionerscommentol14">
         In detailing the required contents of the plats, two different types of legal description are contemplated. First, in subsection (b)(1), the plat must show at least a general schematic map of the entire project. While this may be by survey, the Act recognizes that a survey may be unduly expensive or impractical in a large project, and accordingly permits a general schematic map of the entire project at the commencement of development. With respect to those portions of the project, however, where no future development may take place, the flexibility of a general schematic map is not necessary. At the same time, it becomes important for title purposes to be able to identify precisely that portion of the project which is essentially completed. Accordingly, as development ceases in particular phases, subsection (b)(2) contemplates that the locations and dimensions of that real estate will be identified. As this process continues, all of the real estate originally shown in a general schematic map will have been surveyed, and the location and dimensions of that real estate identified, at the expiration of development rights. In addition, subsection (2) contemplates that existing improvements must be shown within real estate where no further development will take place. This does not mean the units which may be within each building, but it does mean the external physical dimensions of the buildings themselves. As implied by subsection (11), the nature of “existing improvements” required to be surveyed under subsection (2) should be determined by local practices in the particular state.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.09-commissionerscommentol15">
         Subsection (b)(3) requires that the real estate which is subject to development rights must be identified with a legally sufficient description, that is, either a metes and bounds description, or reference to the deeds of that real estate. Since different portions of the real estate may be subject to differing development rights — for example, only a portion of the total real estate may be added as well as withdrawn from the project — the plan must identify the rights applicable to each portion of that real estate. The same reasoning applies to the legally sufficient description of easements affecting the condominium and any leasehold real estate.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.09-commissionerscommentol16">
         Subsection (f) describes the amendments to the plats and plans which must be made as development rights are exercised. This section requires that the plats and plans be amended at each stage of development to reflect actual progress to date. If an original schematic map was initially recorded as required by subsection (b)(1), the survey required by (b)(2) would also constitute the amendments required by subsection (f).
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.09-commissionerscommentol17">
         The terms “horizontal” and “vertical” are now commonly understood in condominium parlance to refer, respectively, to “upper and lower” and “lateral or perimetric.” Thus, Section [34-36.1-2.02] contemplates that the perimetric walls may be designated as the “vertical” boundaries of a unit and the floor and ceiling as its “horizontal” boundaries. That is the sense in which the words “horizontal” and “vertical” are to be understood in this section and throughout this Act.

         This section generally describes the method by which any development right may be exercised. Importantly, while new development rights may be reserved within new real estate which is added to the condominium, the original time limits on the exercise of these rights which the declarant must include in the original declaration may not be extended. Thus, the development process may continue only within the self-determined constraints originally described by the declarant.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.10-commissionerscommentol12">
         The reservation and exercise of development rights is and must be closely co-ordinated with financing for the project. As a result, lender review and control of that process is common, and the financing documents should reflect the proposed development process.
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.10-commissionerscommentol12.1">
          A typical construction loan mortgage on a portion of a phased condominium might provide that as soon as new units are built on new land to be added (or, if the portion is also designated withdrawable land, as soon thereafter as anyone other than the declarant becomes the unit owner of a unit in the withdrawable land) the mortgage on that land converts into a mortgage on all of the units located within that portion, together with their respective common element interests. The common element interest of those units will, of course, extend to the common elements in other sections of the condominium. However, failure of a construction loan mortgage to so provide is inconsequential, because conveyance of the units in that phase to the lender or to a purchaser at a foreclosure sale would automatically transfer all of those units’ common element interests, as a result of the requirements of Sections [34-36.1-2.07(d)] and [34-36.1-2.07(a)].
         </p>

        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.10-commissionerscommentol13">
         A lender who holds a mortgage lien on one portion of a condominium may not cause that portion to be withdrawn from the condominium unless the portion constitutes withdrawable real estate in which there is no unit owner other than the declarant. Even then, the amendment effectuating the withdrawal must be executed by the declarant. Consequently, unless the lender wishes to become a declarant subsequent to foreclosure or a deed in lieu of foreclosure in order to execute the amendment, or forecloses in order to require an amendment from the association under Section [34-36.1-2.18(i)], a lender might require that the signed amendment be deposited in escrow at the time the loan is made in order to protect against a recalcitrant borrower.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.10-commissionerscommentol14">
         As indicated in the Comments to Sections [34-36.1-1.03(24)] and [34-36.1-1.06], the withdrawal of real estate from a condominium may constitute a subdivision of land under the applicable subdivision ordinance. Under most subdivision ordinances, the owner of the real estate is regarded as the “subdivider.” In the event of a withdrawal under this section, however, the declarant is in fact the subdivider because of his unique interest in and control over the real estate, even though the real estate, for title purposes, is a common element until withdrawn. Accordingly, he would bear the cost of compliance with any subdivision ordinance required to withdraw a part of the real estate from the condominium.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.10-commissionerscommentol15">
         Subsection (c) deals with special problems surrounding allocated interests when the declarant subdivides or converts units which were originally created in the declaration into additional units, common elements or both. This development right permits the declarant to defer a final decision as to the size of certain units by permitting the subdivision of larger interior spaces into smaller units. The declarant may thus “build to suit” for purchasers’ needs or to meet changing market demand. The concept is called “convertible space” in several existing state statutes.
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.10-commissionerscommentol15.1">
          For example, a declarant of a 5-story office building condominium may have purchasers committed at the time of the filing of the condominium declaration but a lack of purchasers for the upper 2 floors. In such a circumstance, the declarant could designate the upper 2 floors as a unit, reserving to himself the right to subdivide or convert that unit into additional units, common elements or a combination of units and common elements as needed to suit the requirements of ultimate purchasers.
         </p>
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.10-commissionerscommentol15.2">
          If, at a later time, a purchaser wishes to purchase half of one floor as unit, the declarant could exercise the development right to subdivide his 2-floor unit into 2 or more units. He may also wish to reserve a portion of the divided floor as a corridor which will constitute common elements. In that case, he would proceed pursuant to this subsection to reallocate the allocated interests among the units in the manner described in this section.
         </p>
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.10-commissionerscommentol15.3">
          Alternatively, the declarant may ultimately decide that the entire 2 floors should be turned over to the unit owners’ association not as a unit but as common elements to be used perhaps as a cafeteria serving the balance of the building, or for retail space to be rented by the association. In that case, should he choose to make the entire 2 floors common elements, the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) would apply.

         Subsection (3) deals in a unique manner with the problem of creating access between adjoining units owned by the same person. The subsection provides a specific rule which would permit a door, stairwell, or removal of a partition wall between those units, so long as structural integrity is not impaired. That alteration would not be an alteration of boundaries, but would be an exception to the basic rule stated in subsection (2).

         In considering permissible alteration of the interior of a unit, an example may be useful. A nail driven by a unit owner to hang a picture might enter a portion of the wall designated as part of the common elements, but this section would not be violated because structural integrity would not be impaired. Moreover, no trespass would be committed because each unit owner, as a part owner of the common elements, has a right to utilize them subject only to such restrictions as may be created by the Act, the declaration, bylaws, and the unit owners’ association pursuant to Section [34-36.1-3.02].

         Removal of a partition or the creation of an aperture between adjoining units would permit the units to be used as one, but they would not become one unit. They would continue to be separate units within the meaning of Section [34-36.1-1.04] and would continue to be treated separately for the purposes of this Act.

        Two approaches are presented here as alternatives [Rhode Island adopted Alternative A], since uniformity on this issue is not essential, and various states have adopted one approach or the other. Both theories recognize the fact that the actual physical boundaries may differ somewhat from what is shown on the plats and plans, and the practical effect of both is the same.
       </p>
       <p>
        The easement approach of Alternative A creates easements for whatever discrepancies may arise, while the “monuments as boundaries” approach of Alternative B would make the title lines move to follow movement of the physical boundaries caused by such discrepancies or subsequent settling or shifting.

       A declarant may maintain sales offices, management offices, and models in units or on common elements in the condominium only if the declaration so provides and specifies the rights of a declarant with regard to the number, size, location, and relocation thereof. Any sales office, management office, or model not designated a unit by the declaration is a common element, and if a declarant ceases to be a unit owner, he or she ceases to have any rights with regard thereto unless it is removed promptly from the condominium in accordance with a right to remove reserved in the declaration. Subject to any limitations in the declaration, a declarant may maintain signs on the common elements advertising the condominium.

         This section prescribes the circumstances under which portions of the condominium — either units or common elements — may be used for sales offices, management offices, or models. The basic requirement is that the declarant must describe his rights to maintain such offices in the declaration. There are no limitations on that right, so that either units owned by the declarant or other persons, or the common elements themselves, may be used for that purpose. Typical common element uses might include a sales booth in the lobby of the building, or a trailer or temporary building located outside the buildings on the grounds of the property.

         In addition, this section contains a permissive provision permitting advertising on the common elements. The declarant may choose to limit his rights in terms of the size, location, or other matters affecting the advertising. The Act, however, imposes no limitation. At the same time, the last sentence of the section recognizes that state or local zoning or other laws may limit advertising, both in terms of size and content of the advertising, or the use of the units or common elements for such purposes. This section makes it clear that local law would apply in those cases.

      <p>
       Subject to the provisions of the declaration, a declarant has an easement through the common elements as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of discharging a declarant’s obligations or exercising special declarant rights, whether arising under this chapter or reserved in the declaration.

         This section grants to declarant an easement across the common elements, subject to any self-imposed restrictions on that easement contained in the declaration. At the same time, the easement is not an easement for all purposes and under all circumstances, but only a grant of such rights as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of exercising the declarant’s rights. Thus, for example, if other access were equally available to the land where new units are being created, which did not require the declarant’s construction equipment to pass and repass over the common elements in a manner which significantly inconvenienced the unit owners, a court might apply the “reasonably necessary” test contained in this section to consider limitations on the declarant’s easement. The rights granted by this section may be enlarged by a specific reservation in the declaration.

         This section recognizes that the declaration, as the perpetual governing instrument for the condominium, may be amended by various parties at various times in the life of the project. The basic rule, stated in subsection (a), is that the declaration, including the plats and plans, may only be amended by vote of 67% of the unit owners. The section permits a larger percentage to be required by the declaration, and also recognizes that, in an entirely non-residential condominium, a smaller percentage might be appropriate.

        The association, on behalf of the unit owners, may contract for the sale of real estate in the condominium, but the contract is not binding on the unit owners until approved pursuant to subsections (a) and (b). If any real estate in the condominium is to be sold following termination, title to that real estate, upon termination, vests in the association as trustee for the holders of all interests in the units. Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the sale. Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds thereof distributed, the association continues in existence with all powers it had before termination. Proceeds of the sale must be distributed to unit owners and lien holders as their interests may appear, in proportion to the respective interests of unit owners as provided in subsection (h). Unless otherwise specified in the termination agreement, as long as the association holds title to the real estate, each unit owner and his or her successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted his or her unit. During the period of that occupancy, each unit owner and his or her successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and other obligations imposed on unit owners by this chapter or the declaration.

The decision of the independent appraisers shall be distributed to the unit owners and becomes final unless disapproved within thirty (30) days after distribution by unit owners of units to which a majority of the votes in the association are allocated. The proportion of any unit owner’s interest to that of all unit owners is determined by dividing the fair market value of that unit owner’s unit and common element interest by the total fair market values of all the units and common elements.

         While few condominiums have yet been terminated under present state law, a number of problems are certain to arise upon termination which have not been adequately addressed by most of those statutes. These include such matters as the percentage of unit owners which should be required for termination; the time frame within which written consents from all unit owners must be secured; the manner in which common elements and units should be disposed of following termination, both in the case of sale and non-sale of all of the real estate; the circumstances under which sale of units may be imposed on dissenting owners; the powers held by the Board of Directors on behalf of the association to negotiate a sales agreement; the practical consequences to the project from the time the unit owners approve the termination until the transfer of title and occupancy actually occurs; the impact of termination on liens on the units and common elements; distribution of sales proceeds; the effect of foreclosure or enforcement of liens against the entire condominium with respect to the validity of the project; and other matters.

         Recognizing that unanimous consent from all unit owners would be impossible to secure as a practical matter on a project of any size, subsection (a) states a general rule that 80% consent of the unit owners would be required for termination of a project. The declaration may require a larger percentage of the unit owners and, in a non-residential project, it may also require a smaller percentage. Pursuant to Section [34-36.1-2.19] (Rights of Secured Lenders), lenders may require that the declaration specify a larger percentage of unit owner consent or, more typically, will require the consent of a percentage of the lenders before the project may be terminated.

         As a result of subsection (d), unless the declaration requires unanimous consent for termination, the declarant may be able to terminate the condominium despite the unanimous opposition of other unit owners if the declarant owns units to which the requisite number of votes are allocated. Such a result might occur, for example, should a declarant be unable to continue sales in a project where some sales have been made.

         Subsection (a) describes the procedure for execution of the termination agreement. It recognizes that not all unit owners will be able to execute the same instrument, and permits execution or ratification of the master termination agreement. Since the transfer of an interest in real estate is being accomplished by the agreements, each of the ratifications must be executed in the same manner as a deed. Importantly, the agreement must specify the time within which it will be effective; otherwise, the project might be indefinitely in “limbo” if ratifications had been signed by some, but not all, required unit owners, and the signing unit owners fail to revoke their agreements. Importantly, the agreement becomes effective only when it is recorded.

         Subsections (c) and (d) deal with the question of when all the real estate in the condominium, or the common elements, may be sold without unanimous consent of the unit owners. The section reaches a different result based on the physical configuration of the project.
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.18-commissionerscommentol15.1">
          Subsection (c) states that if a condominium contains only units having horizontal boundaries — a typical high rise building — the unit owners may be required to sell their units upon termination despite objection. Under subsection (d), however, if the project contains any units which do not have horizontal boundaries — for example, a single family home project where some of the units include title to
          <i>
           land
          </i>
          and could theoretically continue apart from a condominium as a title matter — then the termination agreement may not force dissenting unit owners to sell their units unless the declaration as originally recorded provided otherwise. Obviously, of course, if all the unit owners consent to the sale of the units, sale of the entire development would be possible.

         Subsection (e) describes the powers of the association during the pendency of the termination proceedings. It empowers the association to negotiate for the sale, but makes the validity of any contract dependent on unit owner approval. This section also makes clear that, upon termination, title to the real estate shall be held by the association, so that the association may convey title without the necessity of each unit owner signing the deed. Finally, this section makes clear that, until the association delivers title to the condominium property, the project will continue to operate as it had prior to the termination, thus insuring that the practical necessities of operation of the real estate will not be impaired.

         A complex series of creditors’ rights questions may arise upon termination. Those questions involve competing claims of first mortgage holders on individual units, other secured and unsecured creditors of individual unit owners, judgment creditors of the association, creditors of the association to whom a security interest in the common elements has been granted, and unsecured creditors of the association. Subsection (g) attempts to establish general rules with respect to these competing claims, but leaves to state law the resolution of the priorities of those competing claims.

         Subsection (h) departs significantly from the usual result under most condominium acts. Under those acts the proceeds of the sale of the entire project are distributed upon termination to each unit owner in accordance with the common element interest which was allocated at the outset of the project. Of course, in an older development, those original allocations will bear little resemblance to the actual value of the units. For that reason, the Act adopts an appraisal procedure for distribution of the sales proceeds. This appraisal may dramatically affect the amount of dollars actually received by unit owners. Accordingly, it is likely the appraisal will be required to be distributed prior to the time the termination agreement is approved, so that unit owners may understand the likely financial consequences of the termination.

         Subsection (h)(2) is an exception to the “fair market value” rule. It provides that, if appraisal of any unit cannot be made, either through pictures or comparison with other units, so that any unit’s appropriate share in the overall proceeds cannot be calculated, then the distribution will fall back on the only objective, albeit artificial, standard available, which is the common element interest allocated to each unit.

         The termination agreement should adopt or contain any restrictions, covenants and other provisions for the governance and operation of the property formerly constituting the condominium which the owners deem appropriate. These might closely parallel the provisions of the declaration and bylaws. This is particularly important in the case of a condominium which is not to be sold pursuant to the terms of the termination agreement. In the absence of such provisions, the general law of the state governing tenancies in common would apply.

         Subsection (j) recognizes the possibility that a pre-existing lien might not have been released prior to the time the condominium declaration was recorded. In the absence of a provision such as subsection (j), recordation of the declaration would constitute a changing of the priority of those liens; and it is contrary to all expectations that a prior lienholder may be involuntarily subjected to the condominium documents. For that reason, this section permits the non consenting prior lienholder upon foreclosure to exclude the real estate subject to his lien from the condominium.

         In a number of instances, particularly sale or encumbrance of common elements, or termination of a condominium, a lender’s security may be dramatically affected by acts of the association. For that reason, this section permits ratification of those acts of the association which are specified in that declaration as a condition of their effectiveness.

         There are three important limitations on the rights of lender consent. They are: (1) a prohibition on control over the general administrative affairs of the association; (2) restrictions on control over the association’s powers during litigation or other proceedings; and (3) prohibition of receipt or distribution of insurance proceeds prior to application of those proceeds for rebuilding.

         It is important that lenders not be able to step in and unilaterally act as receiver or trustee of the association. There may, of course, be occasions when a court of competent jurisdiction would order appointment of a receiver for an association. While this would be possible in a court proceeding, the Act prohibits private contractual granting of such a power.

        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.19-commissionerscommentol14">
         Since it may well be that the association might find itself involved in litigation which would be adverse to the interests of the lender or the declarant, it is inappropriate for a secured party to be able to control the course of litigation in the absence of the consent of the other parties. In an appropriate case, of course, where the lenders’ interests are affected, a lender might seek to intervene as a party in that proceeding.

         Section [34-36.1-3.13] provides for the distribution of insurance proceeds in a particular manner. In particular, it prevents distribution of those proceeds to lenders until the intended purpose of the insurance has been met.

         It is very common in large or multi-phased condominiums, particularly those developed under existing laws, for the declarant to create a master or umbrella association which provides management services or decision-making functions for a series of smaller condominiums. While it is expected that this phenomenon will be less necessary under this Act because of the permissible period of time for declarant control over the project, it is nonetheless possible in larger developments that this form of management will continue. Moreover, this section should be of significant benefit to the larger number of condominiums created under prior law which have need for the benefits of a provision on master associations.

         Subsection (a) states the general rule that the powers of a unit owners’ association may only be exercised by, or delegated to, a master association if the declaration for the condominium permits that result. The declaration may have originally provided for a master association; alternatively, the unit owners of several condominiums may amend their declarations in similar fashion to provide for this power. Subsection (a) makes it clear that, if any of the powers of the unit owners’ association may be exercised by, or delegated to, a master association, all other provisions of this Act which apply to a unit owners’ association apply to that master association except as modified by this section. Accordingly, such provisions on notice, voting, quorums, records, meetings, and other matters which apply to the unit owners’ association would apply with equal validity to such a master association.

         Subsection (b) changes the usual presumption with respect to the powers of the unit owners’ association, except in those cases where the master association is actually acting as the only association for one or more condominiums. In those cases where it is not so acting, however, the only powers of the unit owners’ association which the master association may exercise are the ones expressly permitted in the declaration or in the delegation of power. This is in significant contrast with the rule of Section [34-36.1-2.02] that all of the powers described in that section may be exercised unless limited by the declaration.

         Subsection (c) clarifies the liability of the members of the executive board of a unit owners’ association when the condominium for which the unit owners’ association acts has delegated some of its powers to a master association. In that instance, subsection (c) makes it clear that the members of the executive board of the unit owners’ association have no liability for acts and omissions of the master association board; under subsection (a), that liability lies with the members of the master association.

         Subsection (d) addresses the question of the rights and responsibilities of the unit owners in their dealings with the master board. A variety of sections enumerated in subsection (d) provide certain rights and powers to unit owners in their dealings with their association. In the affairs of the master association, however, it would be incongruous for the unit owners to maintain those same rights if those unit owners were not in fact electing the master board. Thus, for example, the question of election of directors, meetings, notice of meetings, quorums, and other matters enumerated in those sections would have little meaning if those sections were read literally when applied to a master board which was not elected by all members of the condominiums subject to the master board. For that reason, the rights of notice, voting, and other rights enumerated in the Act are available only to the persons who actually elect the board.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.20-commissionerscommentol16">
         Subsection (e) recognizes that there may be reasons for a representative form of election of directors of the master association. Alternatively, there may be cases where at-large election is reasonable. For that reason, subsection (e) provides that, after the period of declarant control has terminated, there may be 4 ways of electing the master association board. Those four ways are: (1) at-large election of the master board among all the condominiums subject to the master association; (2) at-large election of the master board only among the members of the executive boards of all condominiums subject to the master association; (3) each condominium might have designated positions on the master board, and those spaces could be filled by an at-large election among all the members of each condominium; or (4) the designated positions could be filled by an election only among the members of the executive board of the unit owners’ association for each condominium. It would only be in the case of an at-large election of the master board among all condominiums that subsection (d) would have no relevance.

         There may be circumstances where condominiums may wish to merge or consolidate their activities by the creation of a single condominium; this section provides for that possibility.
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.21-commissionerscommentol11.1">
          Subsection (a) makes it clear that a merger or consolidation may occur by the same vote of the unit owners necessary to terminate the condominium. If 2 or more condominiums are merged or consolidated, the resulting condominium is for all purposes the legal successor of the pre-existing condominiums, with a single association for all purposes. In the event condominiums did not wish to completely merge or consolidate their affairs, it would also be possible for them to create a master association pursuant to Section [34-36.1-2.20].
         </p>
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.21-commissionerscommentol12">
         Under subsection (b), the merger or consolidation agreement is treated for recording purposes as an amendment to the declaration, and the same requirements for approval are mandated as for termination.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.21-commissionerscommentol13">
         Subsection (c) does not state a minimum requirement for the contents of a merger or consolidation agreement, and any additional clauses not inconsistent with subsection (c) may be included. The important point that subsection (c) makes is that the reallocation of the common element interests, common expense liabilities and votes in the new association must be carefully stated.
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.21-commissionerscommentol13.1">
          Subsection (c) states 2 alternative rules in this respect. First, the reallocations may be accomplished by stating specifically the allocation of common element interests, common expense liability, and votes in the association to each unit, or by stating the formulas by which those interests may be allocated to each unit in all of the pre-existing condominiums.
         </p>
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIs34-36.1-2.21-commissionerscommentol13.2">
          Alternatively, the merger or consolidation agreement may state the percentage of overall common element interests, common expense liabilities, and votes in the association allocated to “all of the units comprising each of the pre-existing condominiums.” The agreement might then also provide that the portion of the percentage allocated to each unit from among the shares allocated to each condominium will be equal to the percentage of common expense liability and votes in the association allocated to that unit by the declaration of the preexisting condominium.

         This section permits the declaration, subject to the limitations of subsection (b), to include limitations on the exercise of any of the enumerated powers. [Enacting Instructions.]

        <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.02-commissionerscommentol12">
         Required provisions of the bylaws of the association, referenced in paragraph (1), are set forth in Section [34-36.1-3.06].

        <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.02-commissionerscommentol13">
         Many state condominium statutes give the association the power to sue and be sued in its own name. In the absence of a statutory grant of standing such as that set forth in paragraph (4), some courts have held that the association, because it has no ownership interest in the condominium, has no standing to bring, defend, or to intervene in litigation or administrative proceedings in its own name.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.02-commissionerscommentol14">
         Paragraph (8) refers to the power granted by Section [34-36.1-3.12] to sell or encumber common elements without a termination of the condominium upon a vote of the requisite number of unit owners. Paragraph (9) permits the association to grant easements, leases, licenses, and concessions with respect to the common elements without a vote of the unit owners.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.02-commissionerscommentol15">
         The powers granted the association in paragraph (11) to impose charges for late payment of assessments and to levy reasonable fines for violations of the association’s rules reflect the need to provide the association with sufficient powers to exercise its “governmental” functions as the ruling body of the condominium community. These powers are intended to be in addition to any rights which the association may have under other law.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.02-commissionerscommentol16">
         Under paragraph (14), the declaration may provide for the assignment of income of the association, including common expense assessment income, as security for, or payment of, debts of the association. The power may be limited in any manner specified in the declaration — for example, the power might be limited to specified purposes such as repair of existing structures, or to income from particular sources such as income from tenants, or to a specified percentage of common expense assessments. The power, in many instances, should help materially in securing credit for the association at favorable interest rates. The inability of associations to borrow because of a lack of assets, in spite of its income stream, has been a significant problem.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.02-commissionerscommentol17">
         If the association is incorporated, it may, pursuant to paragraph (16), exercise all other powers of a corporation. Similarly, if the association is unincorporated, the association may, by virtue of paragraph (16), exercise all other powers of an unincorporated association. Inconsistent provisions of state corporation or unincorporated association law are subject to the provisions of this Act, as provided in Section [34-36.1-1.08].

         Subsection (a) makes members of the executive board appointed by the declarant liable as fiduciaries of the unit owners with respect to their actions or omissions as members of the board. This provision imposes a very high standard of duty because the board is vested with great power over the property interests of unit owners, and because there is a great potential for conflicts of interest between the unit owners and the declarant.
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.03-commissionerscommentol11.1">
          Officers and board members elected by the unit owners are required only to exercise ordinary and reasonable care. This lower standard of care should increase the willingness of unit owners to serve as officers and members of the board.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.03-commissionerscommentol12">
         The provisions of paragraph (c) permit the unit owners to disapprove any proposed budget, but a rejection of the budget does not result in cessation of assessments until a budget is approved. Rather, assessments continue on the basis of the last approved periodic budget until the new budget is in effect.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.03-commissionerscommentol13">
         Subsections (d) and (e) recognize the practical necessity for the declarant to control the association during the developmental phases of a condominium project. However, any executive board member appointed by the declarant pursuant to subsection (d) is liable as a fiduciary to any unit owner for his acts or omissions in such capacity.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.03-commissionerscommentol14">
         Subsection (d) permits a declarant to surrender his right to appoint and remove officers and executive board members prior to the termination of the period of declarant control in exchange for a veto right over certain actions of the association or its executive board. This provision is designed to encourage transfer of control by declarants to unit owners as early as possible, without impinging upon the declarant’s rights (for the duration of the period of declarant control) to maintain ultimate control of those matters which he may deem particularly important to him. It might be noted that the declarant at all times (even after the expiration of the period of declarant control) is entitled to cast the votes allocated to his units in the same manner as any other unit owner.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.03-commissionerscommentol15">
         Subsection (e), in combination with subsection (d), provides for a gradual transfer of control of the association to the unit owners from the declarant. Such a gradual transfer is preferable to a one-time turnover of control since it assures that the unit owners will be involved, to some extent, in the affairs of the association from a relatively early date and that some unit owners will acquire experience in dealing with association matters.

         This section deals with the issue of the extent to which obligations and liabilities imposed upon a declarant by this Act are transferred to a third party by a transfer of the declarant’s interest in a condominium. There are two parts to the problem. First, what obligations and liabilities to unit owners (both existing unit owners and persons who become unit owners in the future) should a declarant retain, notwithstanding his transfer of interests. Second, what obligations and liabilities may fairly be imposed upon the declarant’s successor in interest. No present condominium statute adequately addresses these issues.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.04-commissionerscommentol12">
         This section strikes a balance between the obvious need to protect the interests of unit owners and the equally important need to protect innocent successors to a declarant’s rights, especially persons such as mortgagees whose only interest in the condominium project is to protect their debt security. The general scheme of the section is to impose upon a declarant continuing obligations and liabilities for promises, acts, or omissions undertaken during the period that he was in control of the condominium, while relieving a declarant who transfers all or part of his special declarant rights in a project of such responsibilities with respect to the promises, acts, or omissions of a successor over whom he has no control. Similarly, the section imposes obligations and liabilities arising after the transfer upon a non-affiliated successor to a declarant’s interests, but absolves such a transferee of responsibility for the promises, acts, or omissions of a transferor declarant over which he had no control. Finally, the section makes special provision for the interests of certain successor declarants (e. g., a mortgagee who succeeds to the rights of the declarant pursuant to a “deed in lieu of foreclosure” and who holds the project solely for transfer to another person) by relieving such persons of virtually all of the obligations and liabilities imposed upon declarants by this Act.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.04-commissionerscommentol13">
         Subsection (a) provides that a successor in interest to a declarant may acquire the special rights of the declarant only by recording an instrument which reflects a transfer of those rights. This recordation requirement is important to determine the duration of the period of declarant control pursuant to Section [34-36.1-3.03(d) and (e)], as well as to place unit owners on notice of all persons entitled to exercise the special rights of a declarant under this Act. The transfer by a declarant of all of his interest in a condominium project to a successor, without a concomitant transfer of the special rights of a declarant pursuant to this subsection, results in the automatic termination of such special declarant rights and of any period of declarant control.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.04-commissionerscommentol14">
         Under subsection (b), a transferor declarant remains liable to unit owners (both existing unit owners and persons who subsequently become unit owners) for all obligations and liabilities, including warranty obligations on all improvements made by him, arising prior to the transfer. If a declarant transfers any special declarant right to an affiliate (as defined in Section [34-36.1-1.03(1)]), the transferor remains subject to all liabilities specified in paragraph (1) of subsection (b) and, in addition, is jointly and severally liable with his successor in interest for all obligations and liabilities of the successor.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.04-commissionerscommentol15">
         The obligations and liabilities imposed upon transferee declarants under the Act are set forth in subsection (e). In general, a transferee declarant (other than an affiliate of the original declarant and other than a successor whose interest in the project is solely for the protection of debt security) becomes subject to all obligations and liabilities imposed upon a declarant by the Act or by the declaration with respect to any promises, acts, or omissions undertaken subsequent to the transfer which relate to the rights he holds. Such a transferee is liable for the promises, acts, or omissions of the original declarant undertaken prior to the transfer, except as set forth in paragraph (e)(2)(ii). For example, a successor declarant would not be liable for the warranty obligations of the original declarant with respect to improvements to the project made by the original declarant. Similarly, a successor would not be liable, under normal circumstances, for any misrepresentation or breach of fiduciary duty by the original declarant prior to the transfer. The successor is liable, however, to complete improvements labeled “MUST BE BUILT” on the original plans.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.04-commissionerscommentol16">
         To preclude declarants from evading their obligations and liabilities under this Act by transferring their interests to affiliated companies, paragraph (1) of subsection (e) makes clear that any successor declarant who is an affiliate of the original declarant is subject to all obligations and liabilities imposed upon the original declarant by the Act or by the declaration. Similarly, as previously noted, paragraph (2) of subsection (b) provides that an original declarant who transfers his rights to an affiliate remains jointly and severally liable with his successor for all obligations and liabilities imposed upon declarants by the Act or by the declaration.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.04-commissionerscommentol17">
         The section handles the problem of certain successor declarants (i. e., persons whose sole interest in the condominium project is the protection of debt security) in three ways. First, subsection (c) provides that, in the case of a foreclosure of a mortgage, a sale by a trustee under a deed of trust, or a sale by a trustee in bankruptcy of any units owned by a declarant, any person acquiring title to all of the units being foreclosed or sold may request the transfer of special declarant rights. In that event, and only upon such request, such rights will be transferred in the instrument conveying title to the units and such transferee will thereafter become a successor declarant subject to the other provisions of this section. In the event of a foreclosure, sale by a trustee under a deed of trust, or sale by a trustee in bankruptcy of all units owned by a declarant, if the transferee of such units does not request the transfer of special declarant rights, then, under subsection (d), such special declarant rights cease to exist and any period of declarant control terminates.
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.04-commissionerscommentol17.1">
          Second, any person who succeeds to special declarant rights as a result of the transfers just described or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, may, pursuant to paragraph (4) of subsection (e), declare his intention (in a recorded instrument) to hold those rights solely for transfer to another person. Thereafter, such a successor may transfer all special declarant rights to a third party acquiring title to any units owned by the successor but may not, prior to such transfer, exercise any special declarant rights other than the right to control the executive board of the association in accordance with the provisions of Section [34-36.1-3.03(c)]. A successor declarant who exercises such a right is relieved of any liability under the Act except liability for any acts or omissions related to his control of the executive board of the association. This provision is designed to deal with the typical problem of a foreclosing mortgage lender who opts to bid in and obtain the project at the foreclosure sale solely for the purpose of subsequent resale. It permits such a foreclosing lender to undertake such a transaction without incurring the full burden of declarant obligations and liabilities. At the same time, the provision recognizes the need for continuing operation of the association and, to that end, permits a foreclosing lender to assume control of the association for the purpose of ensuring a smooth transition.
         </p>
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.04-commissionerscommentol17.2">
          Third, paragraph (3) of subsection (e) provides that a successor who has only the right to maintain model units, sales offices, and signs does not thereby become subject to any obligations or liabilities as a declarant except for the obligation to provide a public offering statement and any liability resulting therefrom. This provision also is designed to protect mortgage lenders and contemplates the situation where a lender takes over a condominium project and desires to sell out existing units without making any additional improvements to the project. This provision facilitates such a transaction by relieving the mortgage lender, in that instance, from the full burden of obligations and liabilities ordinarily imposed upon a declarant under the Act.
         </p>
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.04-commissionerscommentol17.3">
          Under Section [34-36.1-2.10], a declarant may reserve the right to create additional units in portions of the condominium which were originally designated as common elements. The declarant becomes the owner of any units created, but, prior to creation of units, the title to those portions of the condominium is in the unit owners. The right to create the units is an interest in land in which a security interest might be granted. If the mortgagee of that interest forecloses, the purchaser at the foreclosure sale has the choices concerning development rights and resulting liability which are described in the preceding paragraph. That is, under subsections (c) and (d), the purchaser may limit his liability by agreeing to hold the developments only for the purpose of transfer as provided by paragraph (e)(4) or may buy the rights under paragraph (c).

       If entered into before the executive board elected by the unit owners pursuant to § 34-36.1-3.03(f) takes office, (1) any management contract, employment contract, or lease of recreational or parking areas or facilities, (2) any other contract or lease between the association and a declarant or an affiliate of a declarant, or (3) any contract or lease that is not bona fide or was unconscionable to the unit owners at the time entered into under the circumstances then prevailing, may be terminated without penalty by the association at any time after the executive board elected by the unit owners pursuant to § 34-36.1-3.03(f) takes office upon not less than ninety (90) days’ notice to the other party. This section does not apply to any lease the termination of which would terminate the condominium or reduce its size, unless the real estate subject to that lease was included in the condominium for the purpose of avoiding the right of the association to terminate a lease under this section.

         This section deals with a common problem in the development of condominium projects: the temptation on the part of the developer, while in control of the association, to enter into, on behalf of the association, long-term contracts and leases with himself or with an affiliated entity.
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.05-commissionerscommentol11.1">
          The Act deals with this problem in two ways. First, Section [34-36.1-3.03(a)] imposes upon all executive board members appointed by the declarant liability as fiduciaries of the unit owners for all of their acts or omissions as members of the board. Second, Section [34-36.1-3.05] provides for the termination of certain contracts and leases made during a period of declarant control.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.05-commissionerscommentol12">
         In addition to contracts or leases made by a declarant with himself or with an affiliated entity, there are also certain contracts and leases so critical to the operation of the condominium and to the unit owners’ full enjoyment of their rights of ownership that they too should be voidable by the unit owners upon the expiration of any period of declarant control. At the same time, a statutorily-sanctioned right of cancellation should not be applicable to all contracts or leases which a declarant may enter into in the course of developing a condominium project. For example, a commercial tenant would not be willing to invest substantial amounts in equipment and other improvements for the operation of his business if the lease could unilaterally be cancelled by the association. Accordingly, this section provides that (subject to the exception set forth in the last sentence thereof), upon the expiration of any period of declarant control, the association may terminate without penalty, any “critical” contract (i.e., any management contract, employment contract, or lease of recreational or parking areas or facilities) entered into during a period of declarant control, any contract or lease to which the declarant or an affiliate of the declarant is a party, or any contract or lease previously entered into by the declarant which is not bona fide or which was unconscionable to the unit owners at the time entered into under the circumstances then prevailing.

        <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.05-commissionerscommentol13">
         The last sentence of the section addresses the usual leasehold condominium situation where the underlying real estate is subject to a long-term ground lease which is then submitted to the Act. Because termination of the ground lease would terminate the condominium, this sentence prevents cancellation. However, in order to avoid the possibility that recreation and other leases otherwise cancellable under subsection (a) will be restructured to come within the exception, a subjective test of “intent” is imposed. Under the test, if a declarant’s principal purpose in subjecting the leased real estate to the condominium was to prevent termination of the lease, the lease may nevertheless be terminated.

         The Act permits the declaration to separate maintenance responsibility from ownership. This is commonly done in practice. In the absence of any provision in the declaration, maintenance responsibility follows ownership of the unit or rests with the association in the case of common elements. Under this Act, limited common elements (which might include, for example, patios, balconies, and parking spaces) are common elements. See Section [34-36.1-1.03(16)]. As a result, under subsection (a), unless the declaration requires that unit owners are responsible for the upkeep of such limited common elements, the association will be responsible for their maintenance. Under Section [34-36.1-3.15(c)], the cost of maintenance, repair, and replacement for such limited common elements is assessed against all the units in the condominium, unless the declaration provides for such expenses to be paid only by the units benefited. See Comment 1 to Section [34-36.1-2.08].

         Under Section [34-36.1-2.10], a declarant may reserve the right to create units in portions of the condominium originally designated as common elements. Prior to creation of the units, title to those portions of the condominium is in the unit owners. However, under Section [34-36.1-3.07(b)], the developer is obligated to pay all of the expenses of (including real estate taxes properly apportionable to) that real estate. As to real estate taxes, see Section [34-36.1-1.05(c)].

        Mandatory quorum requirements lower than 50 percent for meetings of the association are often justified because of the common difficulty of inducing unit owners to attend meetings. The problem is particularly acute in the case of resort condominiums where many owners may reside elsewhere, often at considerable distances, for most of the year.

        Subsection (c) addresses an increasingly important matter in the governance of condominiums: the role of tenants occupying units owned by investors or other persons. Most present statutes require voting by owners in the association. However, it may be desirable to give lessees, rather than lessors, of units the right to vote on issues involving day-to-day operation both because the lessees may have a greater interest than the lessors and because it is desirable to have lessees feel they are an integral part of the condominium community.

       Neither the association nor any unit owner except the declarant is liable for that declarant’s torts in connection with any part of the condominium which that declarant has the responsibility to maintain. Otherwise, an action alleging a wrong done by the association must be brought against the association and not against any unit owner. If the wrong occurred during any period of declarant control and the association gives the declarant reasonable notice of and an opportunity to defend against the action, the declarant who then controlled the association is liable to the association or to any unit owner: (1) for all tort losses not covered by insurance suffered by the association or that unit owner, and (2) for all costs which the association would not have incurred but for a breach of contract or other wrongful act or omission. Whenever the declarant is liable to the association under this section, the declarant is also liable for all litigation expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred by the association. Any statute of limitation affecting the association’s right of action under this section is tolled until the period of declarant control terminates. A unit owner is not precluded from bringing an action contemplated by this section because he or she is a unit owner or a member or officer of the association. Liens resulting from judgments against the association are governed by § 34-36.1-3.17.

         This section provides that any action in tort or contract arising out of acts or omissions of the association shall be brought against the association and not against the individual unit owners. This changes the law in states where plaintiffs are forced to name individual unit owners as the real parties in interest to any action brought against the association.

To assure that the decision to bring such an action can be made by an executive board free from the influence of the declarant, the subsection also provides that any statute of limitations affecting such a right of action by the association shall be tolled until the expiration of any period of declarant control.

         Subsection (a) provides that, on agreement of unit owners holding 80% of the votes in the association, parts of the common elements may be sold or encumbered. (80% is the percentage required for termination of the condominium under Section [34-36.1-2.18].) This power may be exercised during the period of declarant control, but, in order to be effective, 80% of non-declarant unit owners must approve the action.

          The ability to sell a portion of the common elements without termination of the condominium gives the condominium regime desirable flexibility. For example, the unit owners, some years after the initial creation of the condominium, may decide to convey away a portion of the open space which has been reserved as a part of the common elements because they no longer find the area useful or because they wish to use sale proceeds to make other improvements. Similarly, the ability to encumber common elements gives the association power to raise money for improvements through the device of mortgaging the improvements themselves. Of course, recreational improvements will frequently not be sufficient security for a loan for their construction. Nevertheless, the ability to take a security interest in such improvements may lead lenders to be more favorably disposed toward making a loan in larger amounts and at lower interest rates.

        <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.12-commissionerscommentol12">
         Subsection (b) requires that the agreement for sale or encumbrance be evidenced by the execution of an agreement in the same manner as a deed by the requisite majority of the unit owners. The agreement then must be recorded in the land records. The recorded agreement signed by the unit owners is not the conveyance itself, but is rather a supporting document which shows that the association has full power to execute a deed or mortgage. Under subsection (c), it is contemplated that the association will execute the actual instrument of conveyance. Under subsection (e), a conveyance or encumbrance of common elements may not deprive a unit owner of rights of access and support.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.12-commissionerscommentol13">
         Under the condominium form of ownership, each unit owner owns a share of the common elements as an appurtenant interest to his unit and, when the unit owner mortgages his unit, he also mortgages his appurtenant interest. The unit owner himself cannot convey his unit separately from its interest in the common elements nor can he convey his common element interest separately from the unit. Therefore, if there is a mortgage or other lien against any unit, the problem arises as to whether the association under this section can convey a part of the common elements free from the mortgage interest of the unit mortgagee. Subsection (f) answers that question no. Therefore, a sale or encumbrance of common elements under this section would be subject to the superior priority of any prior mortgagee on the unit unless the mortgagee releases his interest therein.
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.12-commissionerscommentol13.1">
          The introductory language is intended to permit the declaration to vary the rule of subsection (f). The declaration might provide, for example, that any subsequent conveyance of specified portions of the common elements would be free of prior security interests. In that case, the security interest in the common elements held by unit mortgagees would be cut off. Since the loss of the security interest in the common elements could significantly affect mortgagees, states considering inclusion of the bracketed language probably should consult mortgagee groups. If limited to particular common element real estate such as portions of recreational area land, and if protections are provided for lender interests, the ability to convey free of prior security interests could contribute significantly to the continued economic viability of a project.
         </p>
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.12-commissionerscommentol13.2">
          The declaration could protect lender interests in connection with a conveyance free of the security interests in a number of ways. For example, the declaration might provide for payment of a specified percentage of the sales price to unit mortgagees or it might provide that a specified percentage of the mortgage debt be paid to them. Also, the declaration might provide that no sale or encumbrance of common elements would be effective without the approval of a specified percentage of lenders. There are, no doubt, other devices which could afford substantial protection to lenders.

         A plain reading of the condominium statute indicates that the common elements of the condominium cannot be partitioned or transferred, voluntarily or otherwise, in favor of a member of the association or one who holds jointly or in common with said member in the absence of a vote by at least 80 percent of the membership of the association.

         Subsections (a) and (b) provide that the required insurance must be maintained only to the extent reasonably available. This permits the association to comply with the insurance requirements even if certain coverages are unavailable or unreasonably expensive.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.13-commissionerscommentol12">
         Subsection (b) represents a significant departure from the present law in virtually all states by requiring that the association obtain and maintain property insurance on both the common elements and the units within buildings with “stacked” units. See Comment 3. While it has been common practice in many parts of the country (either by custom or as mandated by statute) for associations to maintain property insurance on the common elements, it has generally not been the practice for the property insurance policy to cover individual units as well. However, given the great interdependence of the unit owners in the stacked unit condominium situation, mandating property insurance for the entire building is the preferable approach. Moreover, such an approach will greatly simplify claims procedures, particularly where both common elements and portions of a unit have been destroyed. If common elements and units are insured separately, the insurers could be involved in disputes as to the coverage provided by each policy.
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.13-commissionerscommentol12.1">
          The Act does not mandate association insurance on units in town house or other arrangements in which there are no stacked units. However, if the developer wishes, the declaration may require association insurance as to units having shared walls or as to all units in the development. Many developments will have some units with horizontal boundaries and other units with no horizontal boundaries. In that case, association insurance as to the units having horizontal boundaries is required, but it is not necessary as to other units.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.13-commissionerscommentol13">
         The distinction between what is a common element and what is a unit with respect to the insurance coverage required by this section is complex. The definitions of common elements and a unit in Section [34-36.1-1.03(4) and (28)] are not sufficient for this purpose. To determine the distinction between the common elements and units, one must refer first to the declaration’s section on unit boundaries. That section will define the unit boundaries. If the declaration fails to do so, the provisions of Section [34-36.1-2.02] apply.
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.13-commissionerscommentol13.1">
          In summary, Section [34-36.1-2.02] provides that, if the declaration is silent, all non-loadbearing and non-structural portions of the walls, floors and ceilings are part of the unit, while all loadbearing and structural portions of the walls, floors and ceilings are common elements. Further, with respect to any structure partially within and partially outside of the boundaries of a unit, any portion thereof serving only that unit is a limited common element (
          <i>
           see
          </i>
          definition in Section [34-36.1-1.03(19)]), and any portion thereof serving more than one unit or any portion of the common elements is a part of the common elements. This treats and defines ownership of all portions of the electrical, plumbing and mechanical systems serving the building not entirely within the boundaries of a unit.
         </p>
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.13-commissionerscommentol13.2">
          All spaces, interior partitions, electrical, plumbing and mechanical systems, and all other items within the boundaries of the unit which are attached to the unit boundaries, whether or not deemed fixtures under state law, are part of the unit.

         <p id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.13-commissionerscommentol13.3">
          Put simply, if any item is installed, constructed, repaired or replaced by the declarant or his successor in connection with the original sale of a stacked unit, the item is insured by the association. Clearly, this does not include items of personal property easily movable within the unit or easily removable from the unit (whether or not deemed a fixture under state law), such as a vase, table or other furnishings. If installed by the unit owner, the item should be insured by the unit owner. Those items, installed by the unit owner and not covered by the association policy, are called “improvements and betterments”.

        <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.13-commissionerscommentol14">
         Although “all risk” coverage is not required as to conversion buildings, but merely fire and extended coverage, this is not intended to imply that such coverage is unnecessary. “All risk” coverage is not required because it may not be appropriate in the case of an unrenovated conversion where cost is a critical factor.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.13-commissionerscommentol15">
         The minimum requirement as to the amount of insurance, which is 80% of the actual cash value, should not be viewed as a recommendation; rather, the 80% is a floor. Typically, many condominium documents require insurance in an amount equal to 100% of the replacement cost of the insured property. The Act permits greater flexibility, however, inasmuch as different types of construction and varieties of projects may not require such total coverage with its attendant higher premium cost.

        <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.13-commissionerscommentol16">
         Subsection (a)(2) covers only the liability of the association, and unit owners as members, but does not cover the unit owner’s individual liability for his acts or omissions or liability for occurrences within his unit.

         Clause (1) of the third sentence of subsection (h) would operate as follows: (1) if the condominium consists of campsites, restoration after fire damage might consist of merely resodding the area damaged; (2) if the condominium consists of separate garden-type buildings, restoration after fire damage might consist of demolishing the remaining structure and paving or landscaping the area; and (3) if the condominium consists of a single highrise building, restoration may not be required (if the building is substantially destroyed) inasmuch as “a condition compatible with the remainder of the condominium” would be damaged and unrestored.

        <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.13-commissionerscommentol18">
         The scheme of this section, as set forth in subsection (h), is that any damage or destruction to any portion of the condominium must be repaired (if repairs can be made consistent with applicable safety and health laws) absent a decision to terminate the condominium or a decision by 80% of the unit owners (including the owners of any damaged units) not to rebuild. Unless a decision is made not to rebuild, any available insurance proceeds must be used to effectuate such repairs. For this reason, subsection (e) provides that any loss covered by the association’s property insurance policy shall be adjusted with the association and that the proceeds for any loss shall be payable to the association or to any insurance trustee that may be designated for such purpose. Significantly, such insurance proceeds may not be paid to any mortgagee or other outside party. This provision is necessary to insure that insurance proceeds are available to effectuate any repairs or restoration to the condominium that may be required.

         In the case of commercial or industrial condominiums, unit owners may prefer to act as self-insurers or make other arrangements with respect to property insurance. Accordingly, subsection (i) provides that the insurance requirements of this section may be varied or waived in the case of a condominium all of the units of which are reserved exclusively for non-residential use. Such waiver or modification is not possible in the case of a mixed-use condominium, some of the units of which are used for residential purposes.

        Surplus funds of the association are generally used first for the pre-payment of reserves, and remaining funds are thereafter credited to the account of unit owners or paid to them. In some cases, however, unit owners might prefer that surplus funds be used for other purposes (
        e.g.,
        the purchase of recreational equipment). Accordingly, this section permits the declaration to specify any other use of surplus funds.

         This section contemplates that a declarant might find it advantageous, particularly in the early stages of condominium development, to pay all of the expenses of the condominium himself rather than assessing each unit individually. Such a situation might arise, for example, where a declarant owns most of the units in the condominium and wishes to avoid billing the costs of each unit separately and crediting payment to each unit. It might also arise in the case of a declarant who, although willing to assume all expenses of the condominium, is unwilling to make payments for replacement reserves or for other expenses which he expects will ultimately be part of the association’s budget. Subsection (a) grants the declarant such flexibility while at the same time providing that once an assessment is made against any unit, all units, including those owned by the declarant, must be assessed for their full portion of the common expense liability.

         If additional units are added to a condominium after a judgment has been entered against the association, the new units are not assessed any part of the judgment debt. Since unit owners will know the assessment, and since such unpaid judgment assessments would affect the price paid by purchasers of units, it would be complicated and unnecessary to fairness to reallocate judgment assessments when new units are added.

         Subsection (a) provides that the association’s lien on a unit for unpaid assessments shall be enforceable in the same manner as mortgage liens. [Enacting Instructions].

         To ensure prompt and efficient enforcement of the association’s lien for unpaid assessments, such liens should enjoy statutory priority over most other liens. Accordingly, subsection (a) provides that the association’s lien takes priority over all other liens and encumbrances except those recorded prior to the recordation of the declaration, those imposed for real estate taxes or other governmental assessments or charges against the unit, and first mortgages recorded before the date the assessment became delinquent. However, as to prior first mortgages, the association’s lien does have priority for 6 months’ assessments based on the periodic budget. A significant departure from existing practice, the 6 months’ priority for the assessment lien strikes an equitable balance between the need to enforce collection of unpaid assessments and the obvious necessity for protecting the priority of the security interests of mortgage lenders. As a practical matter, mortgage lenders will most likely pay the 6 months’ assessments demanded by the association rather than having the association foreclose on the unit. If the mortgage lender wishes, an escrow for assessments can be required. Since this provision may conflict with the provisions of some state statutes which forbid some lending institutions from making loans not secured by first priority liens, the law of each state should be reviewed and amended when necessary.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.16-commissionerscommentol13">
         Subsection (e) makes clear that the association may have remedies short of foreclosure of its lien that can be used to collect unpaid assessments. The association, for example, might bring an action in debt or breach of contract against a recalcitrant unit owner rather than resorting to foreclosure.

        <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.16-commissionerscommentol14">
         In view of the association’s powers to enforce its lien for unpaid assessments, subsection (f) provides unit owners with a method to determine the amount presently due and owing. A unit owner may obtain a statement of any unpaid assessment, including fines and other charges enforceable as assessments under subsection (a), currently levied against his unit. The statement is binding on the association, the executive board, and every unit owner in any subsequent action to collect such unpaid assessments.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.16-commissionerscommentol15">
         Units may be part of a condominium and of a larger real estate regime (see the Uniform Planned Community Act, promulgated by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1980, which would govern most associations with assessment powers). For example, a large real estate development may consist of a larger planned community which contains detached single family dwellings and town houses which are not part of any condominium and a highrise building which is organized as a condominium within the planned community. In that case, the planned community association might assess the condominium units for the general maintenance expenses of the planned community and the condominium association would assess for the direct maintenance expenses of the building itself. In such a situation, subsection (c) provides that unpaid liens of the two associations have equal priority regardless of the relative time of creation of the two regimes and regardless of the time the assessments were made or become delinquent.

         When the purchaser of a condominium unit at a condominium association lien foreclosure sale sued to prevent a bank from foreclosing on the bank’s first mortgage recorded before the association’s lien, it was error to dismiss the suit because (1) R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-36.1-3.16(b)(2) gave the association a super-priority lien superior to the mortgage, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-36.1-3.16(b)(1)(ii), up to a certain value, and (2) the bank did not exercise a right of redemption in R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-36.1-3.21(c), so foreclosure of the assessment lien extinguished the bank’s mortgage, as the proceeds of the foreclosure sale were insufficient to satisfy the lien. Twenty Eleven, LLC v.

         This section deals with the effect on unit owners of judgments against the association. The issue is not free from difficulty. Presently, in most states, if the association is organized as a corporation, the unit owners are likely to receive the insulation from liability given shareholders of a corporation, so that the judgment lienholder can satisfy his judgment only against the property of the association. On the other hand, if the association is organized as an unincorporated association, under the law of most states each unit owner would have joint and several liability on the judgment. This Act strikes a balance between the two extremes, making the judgment lien a direct lien against each individual unit, but allowing the individual unit owner to discharge the lien by payment of his pro-rata share of the judgment. The judgment would also be a lien against any property owned by the association.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.17-commissionerscommentol12">
         It should be noted that, while the judgment lien runs directly against unit owners, the actual liability of the unit owner is almost identical with what it would be if the ordinary corporation rule insulating the unit owner from direct liability were applied. If the incorporated association only is liable for a judgment, it will, of course, have no assets to satisfy the judgment except whatever personal property and real estate not a part of the common elements it owns. If a checking account or other cash funds of the association are attached or garnisheed by the creditor, the association, in order to maintain its operations and fulfill its other obligations, will be obliged to make an additional assessment against the unit owners to cover the judgment. The same result follows if the association is to prevent the sale of other assets at an execution sale. That additional assessment would be in precisely the amount for which this Act gives a direct lien against the individual unit owners. Further, if an association which is without sufficient assets to satisfy a judgment refuses to make assessments from which the creditor can have his claim satisfied, it is very likely that a court, in a supplemental proceeding on the judgment, would direct the association to make the necessary assessments against the unit owners. Unpaid assessments made by the association constitute liens against units just as do judgments.
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.17-commissionerscommentol12.1">
          Therefore, whether the lien of the judgment creditor runs against the units directly, or whether the lien is only against the association which finds it necessary to make additional assessments to satisfy the judgment, the unit owner who does not pay his proportionate share will end up with a lien against his unit.
         </p>
         <p id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.17-commissionerscommentol12.2">
          The differences, therefore, between the lien system established by Section [34-36.1-3.17] and the system which would be applicable if ordinary corporation rules were applied are these:
         </p>
         <ol>
          <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.17-commissionerscommentol121">
           The unit owner can discharge his unit from the lien and free it from the possibility of being subsequently assessed by the association for the judgment by making a payment directly to the lien holder. This ability may be valuable to a unit owner who is in the process of selling or securing a mortgage on his unit during the period between the time the judgment is entered and the time the association makes a formal assessment against individual unit owners for the amount of the judgment lien.
          </li>
          <li id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.17-commissionerscommentol122">
           The judgment creditor through his ability to threaten to foreclose the lien on an individual unit if the judgment is not paid is given some leverage over individual unit owners to encourage them to see that the association pays the judgment. Procuring an assessment through pressure on individual unit owners may be quicker and cheaper for the judgment creditor than using supplemental proceedings and having a judge order that the board of directors make the necessary assessment.
           <p id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.17-commissionerscommentol122.1">
            In the rare case where, under corporation law an association could avoid payment of a judgment by dissolution of the association and vesting of title to the units in the unit owners as tenants-in-common or otherwise, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws believes that that result is inappropriate, and that the unit in the condominium itself should be viewed as equity property of the association capable of being reached by judgment creditors in satisfaction of the judgment. As a matter of social policy the condominium association is in quite a different position than the ordinary corporation. The corporation statutes provide shareholders immunity from liability for debts of the corporation to encourage investment in corporations whose entrepreneurial activities in the marketplace contribute to the general wealth and well-being of society. The condominium association, in managing the affairs of the homeowners, does not serve the same entrepreneurial function. It seems reasonable, as a matter of social policy, that an individual homeowner who would be fully liable for debts incurred in the renovation and maintenance of his home or for torts caused by his failure to adequately maintain the premises should not be able to entirely avoid that liability through the device of organizing with other homeowners into a condominium association. On the other hand, it is perhaps not fair to a unit owner in a condominium regime to have all of his assets at risk based on the contracts of the association over which he has little control and as to which he has only a fractional interest or benefit.
           </p>
           <p id="t34c36.1asIIIs34-36.1-3.17-commissionerscommentol122.2">
            It should be noted that, except for situations in which the association has given a mortgage or deed of trust on common elements, the judgment creditor cannot assert a lien against common elements, but is rather left to a lien against the units. That is, the judgment creditor has no power to levy on the golf course or on the swimming pool or other open spaces and sell them independently of the units to satisfy the judgment.

        <p>
         When the purchaser of a condominium unit at a condominium association lien foreclosure sale sued to prevent a bank from foreclosing on the bank’s first mortgage recorded before the association’s lien, it was error to dismiss the suit because (1) R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-36.1-3.16(b)(2) gave the association a super-priority lien superior to the mortgage, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-36.1-3.16(b)(1)(ii), up to a certain value, and (2) the bank did not exercise a right of redemption in R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-36.1-3.21(c), so foreclosure of the assessment lien extinguished the bank’s mortgage, as the proceeds of the foreclosure sale were insufficient to satisfy the lien. Twenty Eleven, LLC v.

         Where the bylaws of a condominium association did not specifically state that the foreclosure provisions set forth therein were the only and exclusive provisions, the 1982 statute merely provided an alternative, easier method for achieving the same result of lien and foreclosure, and did not preclude the management committee from following the old rule, namely the bylaws provision.

       </h4>
       <p>
        In the case of commercial and industrial condominiums, the purchaser is often more sophisticated than the purchaser of residential units and thus better able to bargain for the protections he believes necessary. While this may not always be true, no objective test can be developed which easily distinguishes those commercial purchasers who are able to protect themselves from those who, in the ordinary course of business, have not developed such sophistication. At the same time, the cost of protection imposed by Article 4 may be substantial. Accordingly, subsection (a) permits waiver or modification of Article 4 protections in condominiums where all units are restricted to non-residential use,
        e.g.,
        in the case of most commercial and industrial condominiums. However, except for certain waivers of implied warranties of quality (
        <i>
         see
        </i>
        Section [34-36.1-4.15]) and certain exemptions from public offering statement and resale certificate requirements (
        <i>
         see
        </i>
        subsection (b)), no express waiver of the protections of this Article with respect to the purchasers of residential units is permitted by this subsection. Accordingly, by operation of Section [34-36.1-1.04], the rights provided by this Article may not be waived in the case of residential purchasers. Moreover, because of the interrelated rights of residential and commercial owners in mixed-use condominiums, waiver or modification of rights conferred by this Article is restricted to purchasers in wholly nonresidential condominiums.

         The best “consumer protection” that the law can provide to any purchaser is to insure that he has an opportunity to acquire an understanding of the nature of the products which he is purchasing. Such a result is difficult to achieve, however, in the case of the condominium purchaser because of the complex nature of the bundle of rights and obligations which each unit owner obtains. For this reason, the Act, adopting the approach of many so-called “second generation” condominium statutes, sets forth a lengthy list of information which must be provided to each purchaser before he contracts for a unit. This list includes a number of important matters not typically required in public offering statements under existing law. The requirement for providing the public offering statement appears in Section [34-36.1-4.02(c)], and Section [34-36.1-4.08] provides purchasers with cancellation rights and imposes civil penalties upon declarants not complying with the public offering statement requirements of the Act.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.03-commissionerscommentol12">
         Paragraph (a)(2) requires a general description of the condominium and, to the extent possible, the declarant’s schedule for commencement and completion of construction for all building amenities that will comprise portions of the condominium. Under Section [34-36.1-2.09], the declarant is obligated to label all improvements which may be made in the condominium as either “MUST BE BUILT” or “NEED NOT BE BUILT.” Under Section [34-36.1-4.19], the declarant is obligated to complete all improvements labeled “MUST BE BUILT.” The estimated schedule of commencement and completion of construction dates provides a standard for judging whether a declarant has complied with the requirements of Section [34-36.1-4.19].
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.03-commissionerscommentol13">
         Paragraph (4) requires the public offering statement to include copies of the declaration, bylaws, and any rules and regulations of the condominium, as well as copies of any contracts or leases to be executed by the purchaser. In addition, the paragraph requires the public offering statement to include a brief narrative description of the significant features of those documents, as well as of any management contract, leases of recreational facilities, and other sorts of contracts which may be subject to cancellation by the association after the period of declarant control expires, as provided in Section [34-36.1-3.05]. This latter requirement is intended to encourage the preparation of brief summaries of all condominium documents in laymen’s terms, i.e., the “brief narrative description” should be more than a simple explanation of what a declaration (or other document) is, but less than an extended legal analysis duplicating the contents of the documents themselves. The summary requirement is intended to alleviate the common problem of public offering statements being drafted in lawyers’ terms and being no more comprehensible to laymen than the documents themselves.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.03-commissionerscommentol14">
         The disclosure requirement of paragraph (6) is intended to eliminate the common deceptive sales practice known as “lowballing,” a practice by which a declarant intentionally underestimates the budget for the association by providing many of the services himself during the initial sales period. In such a circumstance, the declarant commonly intends that, after a certain time, these services (which might include lawn maintenance, painting, security, bookkeeping, or other services) will become expenses of the association, thereby substantially increasing the periodic common expense assessments which association members must ultimately bear. By requiring the disclosure of these services (including the projected common expense assessment attributable to each) in paragraph (6), the Act seeks to minimize “lowballing”. In order to comply fully with the provisions of paragraph (5), the declarant must calculate the budget on the basis of his best estimate of the number of units which will be part of the condominium during that budget year. This requirement as well operates to negate the effects of any attempted “lowballing.”
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.03-commissionerscommentol15">
         Paragraph (9) requires disclosure of any financing “offered” by the declarant. The paragraph contemplates that a declarant disclose any arrangements for financing that may have been made, including arrangements with any unaffiliated lender to provide mortgages to qualified purchasers.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.03-commissionerscommentol16">
         Under paragraph (10), the declarant is required to disclose the terms of all warranties provided by the declarant (including the statutory warranties set forth in Section [34-36.1-4.14]) and to describe any significant limitations on such warranties, the enforcement thereof, or damages which may be collectible as a result of a breach thereof. This latter requirement would necessitate a description by the declarant of any exclusions or modifications of statutory warranties undertaken pursuant to Section [34-36.1-4.15]. The statute of limitations for warranties set forth in Section [34-36.1-4.16], together with any separate written agreement (as required by Section [34-36.1-4.16]) providing for reduction of the period of such statute of limitations, must also be disclosed.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.03-commissionerscommentol17">
         Paragraph (14) requires that the declarant disclose the existence of any right of first refusal or other restrictions on the uses for which or classes of persons to whom units may be sold.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.03-commissionerscommentol18">
         Paragraph (15) corrects a defect common to many condominium statutes by requiring the declarant to describe the insurance coverage provided for the benefit of unit owners. See Section [34-36.1-3.13].
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.03-commissionerscommentol19">
         Under paragraph (16), the declarant is obligated to disclose any current or expected fees or charges which unit owners may be required to pay for the use of the common elements and other facilities related to the condominium. Such fees or charges might include swimming pool fees, golf course fees, or required membership fees for recreation associations. Such fees are often not disclosed to condominium purchasers and can represent a substantial addition to their monthly assessments.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.03-commissionerscommentol110">
         The “financial arrangements” required to be disclosed pursuant to paragraph (17) may vary substantially from one condominium development to another. It is the intent of the paragraph to give purchasers as much information as possible with which to assess the declarant’s ability to carry out his obligations to complete the improvements. For example, if a declarant has a commitment from a bank to provide construction financing for a swimming pool when 50% of the units in the condominium are completed, that fact should be disclosed to potential purchasers.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.03-commissionerscommentol111">
         In addition to the information required to be disclosed by paragraphs (1) through (18), paragraph (19) requires that the declarant disclose all other “unusual and material circumstances, features, and characteristics” of the condominium and all units therein. This requires only information which is both “unusual and material.” Thus, the provision does not require the disclosure of “material” factors which are commonly understood to be part of the condominium, e.g., the fact that a condominium has a roof, walls, doors, and windows. Similarly, the provision does not require the disclosure of “unusual” information about the condominium which is not also “material,” e.g., the fact that a condominium is the first condominium in a particular community. Information which would normally be required to be disclosed pursuant to paragraph (19) might include, to the extent that they are unusual and material, environmental conditions affecting the use or enjoyment of the condominium, features of the location of the condominium, e.g., near the end of an airport runway or a planned rendering plant, and the like.

        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.03-commissionerscommentol112">
         The cost of preparing a public offering statement can be substantial and may, particularly in the case of small condominiums, represent a significant portion of the cost of a unit. For that reason, subsection (b) permits a declarant to exclude from a public offering statement certain information in the case of a small condominium (i.e., less than 12 units) which is not subject to development rights and which is not potentially part of a larger condominium or group of condominiums. Essentially, subsection (b) permits a declarant to exclude from a public offering statement those materials which, as a practical matter, require extended preparation effort by an attorney or engineer in addition to the normal effort which must be exerted to provide the declaration, bylaws, plats and plans, or other documents required by the Act.

       <p>
        This section requires disclosure in the public offering statement of the manner in which the declarant’s exercise of development rights may affect purchasers who acquire units before those rights have been fully exercised. The purpose is to put the purchaser on notice of the extent to which the exercise of those rights may alter, sometimes quite dramatically, both the physical and the legal aspects of the project. For example, the prospective purchaser may be contemplating the acquisition of a particular unit because it enjoys a view of open, undeveloped land over which the declarant has, however, reserved development rights. It may be that the boundary of the parcel as to which development rights have been reserved actually coincides with, or runs quite close to, the outer wall of the unit in question. The disclosures or statements made pursuant to paragraphs (8) and (12) of this section will indicate to the prospective purchaser the extent (if any) to which he can rely on the declarant not to do anything which would radically alter the view from the unit which he now finds so appealing.

         Time sharing has become increasingly important in recent years, particularly with respect to resort condominiums. In recognition of this fact, this section requires the disclosure of certain information with respect to time sharing.

         Virtually all existing state condominium statutes are silent with respect to time-share ownership. The inclusion of disclosure provisions for certain forms of time sharing in this Act, however, does not imply that other law regulating time sharing is affected in any way in a state merely because that state enacts this Act.

          The Uniform Law Commissioners’ Model Real Estate Time-Share Act specifies more extensive disclosures for time-share properties. A “time-share property” may include part or all of the condominium, and Section 1-109 of the Model Act [Not enacted in Rhode Island] governs conflicts between this Act and time-share legislation.

         In the case of a condominium containing one or more conversion buildings, the disclosure of additional information relating to the condition of those buildings is required in the public offering statement because of the difficulty inherent in a single purchaser attempting to determine the condition of what is likely to be an older building being renovated for the purpose of condominium sales.

         Paragraph (a)(1) requires the person who gives the public offering statement to retain an independent architect or engineer to report on the present condition of all structural components and fixed mechanical and electrical installations in the conversion building. Such information is as useful to declarant as to the purchaser since, under the implied warranty provisions of Section [34-36.1-4.14], a declarant impliedly warrants all improvements made by any person to the building “before creation of the condominium” unless such improvements are specifically excluded from the implied warranty of quality pursuant to Section [34-36.1-4.15(b)].

         Under paragraph (a)(3), the person required to give the public offering statement is required to provide purchasers with a list of all outstanding notices of uncured violations of building codes or other municipal regulations. The literal wording of this provision does not require disclosure of known violations of such building codes or municipal regulations (at least violations having no effect upon the structural components or fixed mechanical and electrical installations of the condominium) unless actual “notices” of such violations have been received. To the extent that outstanding notices of uncured violations do exist, the cost of curing such violations would become a liability of the unit owners or the association following transfer of the unit to a purchaser. For that reason, the estimated cost of curing any outstanding violations must also be disclosed.

         Some condominiums are regarded as “investment contracts” or other “securities” under federal law because they exhibit certain investment features such as mandatory rental pools. See SEC Securities Act Release No. 5347 (January 1973). The purpose of this section is to permit the declarant to file or deliver, in lieu of a public offering statement specifically prepared to comply with the provisions of this Act, the prospectus filed with and distributed pursuant to the regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Absent this provision, prospective purchasers of condominiums classified by the SEC as “securities” would have to be given two public offering statements, one prepared pursuant to this Act and the other prepared pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933. Not only would this result increase the declarant’s costs (and thus the price) of units, it might also reduce the likelihood of either public offering statement actually being read by prospective purchasers.

         The “cooling off ” period provided to a purchaser in this section is similar to provisions in many current state condominium statutes.

        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.08-commissionerscommentol12">
         Subsection (a) requires that each purchaser be provided with both the public offering statement and all amendments thereto prior to the time that the unit is conveyed. If there is a contract for the sale of the unit, these documents must be provided not later than the date of the contract. The section makes clear that any amendments to the public offering statement prepared between the date of any contract and the date of conveyance must also be provided to the purchaser.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.08-commissionerscommentol13">
         This section does not require the delivery of a public offering statement prior to the execution by the purchaser of an agreement pursuant to which the purchaser reserves the right to buy a unit but is not contractually bound to do so. Because such agreements (frequently referred to as “non-binding reservation agreements”) may be unilaterally cancelled at any time by a prospective purchaser without penalty, they do not constitute “contract[s] of sale” within the meaning of the section.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.08-commissionerscommentol14">
         The requirement set forth in subsection (a) that a purchaser be provided with subsequent amendments to the public offering statement during the period between execution of the contract for purchase and conveyance of the unit does not, in itself, extend the “cooling off ” period. Indeed, the delivery of such amendments is required even if the “cooling off ” period has expired. The purpose of this requirement is to assure that purchasers of units are advised of any material change in the condominium which may affect their sales contracts under general law. While many such amendments will be merely technical and will not affect the bargain that the purchaser and declarant entered into, each purchaser should be permitted to judge for himself the materiality of any change in the nature of the condominium.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.08-commissionerscommentol15">
         Under the scheme set forth in this section, it is at least theoretically possible that there will be a contract for sale of the unit, and that a public offering statement will be given to the purchaser at closing just prior to conveyance. However, the available evidence suggests that such practice would be rare, and that the provision of a public offering statement moments prior to conveyance would, in itself, tend to dampen the enthusiasm of the purchaser for immediate closing. In such circumstances, under subsection (a), the purchaser would, as a matter of right, be able to extend the date of closing for 15 days from the time the public offering statement was provided. This fact, together with the generally unsatisfactory experience with mandatory “cooling off ” periods such as that imposed under the federal Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, supports the conclusion that it is inappropriate to require a minimum period of delay between delivery of a public offering statement and conveyance.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.08-commissionerscommentol16">
         Under subsection (a), the failure to deliver a public offering statement before conveyance does not result in a statutory right by the purchaser to cancel the conveyance or to reconvey the unit once conveyance has occurred. Any such cancellation or reconveyance right following an actual conveyance could create serious mechanical and title problems that could not be easily resolved. The failure of the Act to provide for such cancellation or reconveyance is not, however, intended to diminish any right which a purchaser may otherwise have under general state law. For example, where it appears that a seller, by deliberately failing to disclose certain material information with respect to a transaction, substantially changed the bargain which he and the purchaser entered into, it is possible under the common law in some states that reconveyance would be an available remedy.
         <p id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.08-commissionerscommentol16.1">
          Even absent such resort to general law, however, the penalty provisions of subsection (c) are designed to provide a sufficient incentive to the seller to insure that the public offering statement is provided in the timely fashion required by the Act. The penalty so specified in the subsection is in addition to any right a prevailing purchaser may have under Section [34-36.1-4.17] to collect punitive damages and attorney’s fees in connection with his action against the declarant.

         In the case of the resale of a unit by a private unit owner who is not a declarant or a person in the business of selling real estate for his own account, a public offering statement need not be provided. See Section [34-36.1-4.02(c)]. Nevertheless, there are important facts which a purchaser should have in order to make a rational judgment about the advisability of purchasing the particular condominium unit. Accordingly, each unit owner not required to furnish a public offering statement under Section [34-36.1-4.02(c)] and not exempt under Section [34-36.1-4.01(b)] is required to furnish to a resale purchaser, before the execution of any contract of sale, a copy of the declaration, bylaws, and rules and regulations of the association and a variety of fiscal, insurance, and other information concerning the condominium and the unit.

         While the obligation to provide the information required by this section rests upon each unit owner (since the purchaser is in privity only with that unit owner), the association has an obligation to provide the information to the unit owner within 10 days after a request for such information. Under Section [34-36.1-3.02(a)(12)], the association is entitled to charge the unit owner a reasonable fee for the preparation of the certificate. Should the association fail to provide the certificate as required, the unit owner would have a right to action against the association pursuant to Section 34-36.1-4.17.

         Under subsection (c), if a purchaser receives a resale certificate which fails to state the proper amount of the unpaid assessments due from the purchased unit, the purchaser is not liable for any amount greater than that disclosed in the resale certificate. Because a resale purchaser is dependent upon the association for information with respect to the outstanding assessments against the unit which he contemplates buying, it is altogether appropriate that the association should be prohibited from later collecting greater assessments than those disclosed prior to the time of the resale purchase.

         This section provides declarant a number of choices as to the appropriate escrow agent. Whether the escrow agent must deposit the funds in an insured institutional depository, or in a particular type of account, depends on state law, or the agreement of the parties. To minimize record keeping, of course, the institutional depository could itself be the escrow agent. The section does not require a separate account for each unit, so that mingling of funds in a single escrow account would be permitted. The account may be held whether in the state where the unit is located, or in the enacting state, in recognition that buyers are often from outside the state where the unit is located.

         In some states, such as New York, the substitution of a bond in place of a deposit escrow is permitted. The evidence indicates, however, that in many instances the use of the bonding device has forced purchasers to incur substantial costs and delay prior to obtaining refunds to which they are entitled. For this reason, this Act does not include bonding as an alternative to the required escrow of deposits.

       </h4>
       <p>
        The exemption for withdrawable real estate set forth in subsection (a) is designed to preserve flexibility for the declarant in terms of financing arrangements. Theoretically, a developer might partially avoid the lien release requirement of subsection (a) by placing part of the common element improvements such as a swimming pool or tennis court on withdrawable real estate. By doing so, it could separately mortgage that part of the common elements without being obligated to discharge the mortgage or secure partial releases when individual units are sold. (However, even if there were no withdrawable real estate exemption from the release of lien requirement, developers could still separately mortgage such improvements as pools and tennis courts without having to discharge the mortgage on sale of units. All they would have to do is leave the particular real estate out of the condominium and then convey it directly to the association subject to the mortgage.)
       </p>
       <p>
        If a mortgage or other lien created by or arising against the developer attaches to withdrawable real estate after the declaration has been recorded, a lapse of the developer’s right to withdraw the real estate would also terminate the rights of the lienor, since the lien would attach only to the developer’s interest (the right to withdraw). However, an alert lienor would not permit the right to withdraw to lapse without taking steps to see that the right to withdraw is exercised. If the mortgage or other lien attached to the real estate and was perfected before the condominium declaration was recorded, lapse of the right to withdraw would not affect the lienor’s rights and it could foreclose on the real estate whether or not the developer had lost the right to withdraw. As a practical matter, whether the mortgage or other lien against withdrawable real estate arises before or after the declaration is recorded, unit owners may find that, if the association does not release liens on withdrawable real estate containing common elements, the lienor will be able to withdraw the land and deprive the unit owners of its use. Therefore, unit purchasers and their counsel should be alert to that possibility.
       </p>
       <p>
        If units are created in withdrawable real estate, the units, when sold, are subject to the release-of-lien rule of subsection (b)(1) and after a unit in a particular withdrawable parcel is sold, that parcel can no longer be withdrawn. In that case, any lien created by or arising against the developer which attached to the real estate and is subordinate to the condominium declaration would automatically expire.

Rents shall not be increased during the notice period. The notice must set forth generally the rights of tenants and subtenants under this section and shall be hand delivered to the unit or mailed by prepaid United States mail to the tenant and subtenant at the address of the unit or any other mailing address provided by a tenant. No tenant or subtenant may be required to vacate upon less than one hundred twenty (120) days’ notice, except by reason of nonpayment of rent, waste, or conduct that disturbs other tenants’ peaceful enjoyment of the premises, and the terms of the tenancy may not be altered during that period.

If a tenant fails to purchase the unit during that sixty (60) day period, the offeror may not offer to dispose of an interest in that unit during the following one hundred eighty (180) days at a price or on terms more favorable to the offeree than the price or terms offered to the tenant.

         One of the most controversial issues in the field of condominium development relates to conversion of rental buildings to condominiums. Opponents of conversions point out that the frequent result of conversions, which occur principally in large urban areas, is to displace low and moderate-income tenants and provide homes for more affluent persons able to afford the higher prices which the converted apartments command. Indeed, studies indicate that the burden of conversion displacement falls most frequently on low- and moderate-income and elderly persons. At the same time, the conversion of a building to condominium ownership can lead to a substantial increase in property value, a result which proponents believe can be an important factor in curtailing the problem of declining urban tax bases. Proponents also point out that the conversion of rental units in inner-city areas to individual ownership frequently results in the stabilization of the buildings concerned, thus providing an important technique for use in neighborhood preservation and revitalization. This section, which seeks to balance these competing interests, is based principally on similar provisions set forth in the condominium statutes of Virginia and the District of Columbia.

        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.12-commissionerscommentol12">
         In an attempt to strike a fair balance between the competing interests of rental tenants and prospective owners, subsection (b) provides the tenant a right for 60 days to purchase the unit which he leases at a price and on terms offered by the declarant. The subsection discourages unreasonable offers by declarants by providing that, if the tenant fails to accept the terms offered, the declarant may not thereafter sell the unit at a lower price or upon more favorable terms to a third person for at least 180 days. However, the declarant is not required to offer residential tenants the right to purchase commercial units or to offer to sell to tenants if the dimensions of their previous apartments have been substantially altered. The reason for this exception is that, if an apartment is subdivided or if two apartments are merged into a single condominium unit, compliance with the requirements of subsection (b) would be impossible.

         Except for the restrictions on permissible evictions stated in subsection (a), this Act does not change the law of summary process in a state. As a result, if a tenant refuses to vacate the premises following the 120-day notice, the usual provisions of the state’s summary process statutes would apply, while any defenses available to a tenant would also be available.

         This section, together with Sections [34-36.1-4.14, 34-36.1-4.15, and 34-36.1-4.16], are adapted from the real estate warranty provisions contained in the Uniform Land Transactions Act (ULTA).
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.13-commissionerscommentol12">
         This section, which parallels Section 2-308 of ULTA, deals with express warranties, that is, with the expectations of the purchaser created by particular conduct of the declarant in connection with inducement of the sale. It is based on the principle that, once it is established that the declarant has acted so as to create particular expectations in the purchaser, warranty should be found unless it is clear that, prior to the time of final agreement, the declarant has negated the conduct which created the expectation.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.13-commissionerscommentol13">
         Subsection (b) makes it clear that no specific intention to make a warranty is necessary if any of the factors mentioned in subsection (a) are made part of the basis of the bargain between the parties. In actual practice, representations made by a declarant concerning condominium property during the bargaining process are typically regarded as a part of the description. Therefore, no particular reliance on the representations need be shown in order to weave them into the fabric of the agreement. Rather, the burden is on the declarant to show that representations made in the bargaining process were not relied upon by the purchaser at the time of contracting.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.13-commissionerscommentol14">
         Subsection (a)(1) provides that representations as to improvements and facilities not located in the condominium may create express warranties. Declarants often assert that recreational facilities, such as swimming pools, golf courses, tennis courts, etc., will be constructed in the future and that unit owners will have the right to utilize such facilities once constructed. Such assertions are intended to be included within the language “have the benefit of facilities not located in the condominium.” If, under the circumstances, such improvements would benefit the unit being sold, then the declarant may be liable for breach of express warranty if they are not completed. Such liability is distinct from the declarant’s obligations, under Section [34-36.1-4.19], to complete all improvements labeled “MUST BE BUILT” on plats and plans.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.13-commissionerscommentol15">
         Under subsection (a)(4), a contract provision permitting the purchaser to use a condominium unit only for a specified use or uses creates an express warranty that the unit may lawfully be used for that purpose. Therefore, if there is a limitation on use, the resulting express warranty could not be disclaimed by a disclaimer of implied warranties under Section [34-36.1-4.15].
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.13-commissionerscommentol16">
         The precise time when representations set forth in subsection (a) are made is not material. The sole question is whether the language or other representations of the declarant are fairly to be regarded as part of the contract between the parties.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.13-commissionerscommentol17">
         Subsection (b) makes clear that it is not necessary to the existence of a warranty that the declarant have intended to assume a warranty obligation. On the other hand, mere statements of opinion or commendations by the declarant do not necessarily create warranties. Whether a particular statement purports to be merely opinion or commendation is basically a question of whether the purchaser could reasonably rely upon the statement as a meaningful representation or promise with respect to the condominium. That determination depends, in turn, not merely upon the words used but also upon the relative characteristics and skills of the parties. Thus a representation by a declarant to a novice purchaser that a particular condominium unit is in “good condition” may be more than mere opinion or commendation, while the same statement by a novice seller to a professional buyer would likely be only opinion or commendation, and thus not a warranty.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.13-commissionerscommentol18">
         The provision of subsection (c) that the conveyance of a unit transfers to the purchaser all express warranties made by prior declarants is intended, in part, to avoid the possibility that a declarant could negate his warranty obligations through the device of transferring a unit through a shell entity to the ultimate purchaser.

         This section, which is based upon Section 2-309 of ULTA, overturns the rule still applied in many states that a professional seller of real estate makes no implied warranties of quality (the rule of “caveat emptor”). In recent years, that rule has been increasingly recognized as a relic of an earlier age whose continued existence defeats reasonable expectations of purchasers. Since the 1930’s, more and more courts have completely or partially abolished the caveat emptor rule, and it is clear that the judicial tide is now running in favor of seller liability.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.14-commissionerscommentol12">
         The principal warranty imposed under this section is that of suitability of both the unit and common elements for ordinary uses of real estate of similar type, and of quality of construction. Both of these warranties, which arise under subsection (b), are imposed only against declarants and not against unit owners selling their units to others.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.14-commissionerscommentol13">
         Many recent cases have held that a seller of new housing impliedly warrants that the houses sold are habitable. The warranty of suitability under this Act is similar to the warranty of habitability. However, under the Act, the warranty of suitability applies to both units and common elements in both commercial and residential condominiums. If, for example, a commercial unit is sold for commercial use although it is not suitable for the ordinary uses of condominium units of that type, the warranty of suitability has been breached. Moreover, this warranty of suitability arises in the case of used, as well as new, buildings or other improvements in the condominium.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.14-commissionerscommentol14">
         The warranty of suitability and of quality of construction arises only against a declarant and persons in the business of selling real estate for their own account. As in the case of sales of goods, a non-professional seller is liable, if at all, only for any express warranties made by him. However, if a non-professional seller fails to disclose defects of which he is aware, he may be liable to the purchaser for fraud or misrepresentation under the common law of the state where the transaction occurred. Also, the warranties imposed by this section may be used to give content to a general “guarantee” by a non-professional seller.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.14-commissionerscommentol15">
         The warranty as to quality of construction for improvements made or contracted for by the declarant or made by any person before the creation of the condominium is broader than the warranty of suitability. Particularly, it imposes liability for defects which may not be so serious as to render the condominium unsuitable for ordinary purposes of real estate of similar type. Moreover, subsection (e) prevents a declarant from avoiding liability with respect to the quality of construction warranty by having an affiliated entity make the desired improvements.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.14-commissionerscommentol16">
         Under subsection (c), a declarant also warrants to a residential purchaser that an existing use contemplated by the parties does not violate applicable law. The declarant, therefore, is liable for any violation of housing codes or other laws which renders any existing use of the condominium unlawful.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.14-commissionerscommentol17">
         The issue of declarant liability for warranties is an important one in cases where a transfer of the declarant’s rights occurs, either as an arm’s length transaction, as a transfer to an affiliate, or as a transfer by foreclosure or a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Subsection (f) makes clear that a conveyance of a unit transfers to the purchaser all warranties of quality made by any declarant, and Section [34-36.1-3.04(b)(1)] makes clear that the original declarant remains liable for all warranties of quality with respect to improvements made by him, even after he transfers all declarant rights, regardless of whether the unit is purchased from the declarant who made the improvements. If the successor declarant is an affiliate of the original declarant, it is clear, under both Sections [34-36.1-3.04(b)(2)] and [34-36.1-4.14(f)], that the original declarant remains liable for warranties of quality or improvements made by his successor even after the declarant himself ceases to have any special declarant rights.
        </li>
        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.14-commissionerscommentol18">
         As to the liabilities of successor declarants for warranties of quality, a successor who is an affiliate of a declarant is liable, pursuant to Section [34-36.1-3.04(e)(1)], for warranties or improvements made by his predecessor. However, any non-affiliated successor of the original declarant is liable only for warranties of quality for improvements made or contracted for by him, and is not liable for warranties which may lie against the original declarant even if the successor sells units completed by the original declarant to a purchaser. See Section [34-36.1-3.04(e)(2)]. In the case of a foreclosing lender, this is the same result as that reached under Section 2-309(f) of ULTA. The same result is also reached under ULTA in the case of a successor who, under ULTA Section 3-309(b), would be a seller in the business of selling real estate since under that subsection the seller is liable only for warranties or improvements made or contracted for by him.

         Under this section, implied warranties of quality may be disclaimed. However, a warranty disclaimer clause, like any other contract clause, is subject to a possible court holding of unconscionability. Although the section imposes no requirement that a disclaimer be in writing, except in the case of residential units, an oral disclaimer might be ineffective under the law of parole and extrinsic evidence.

        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.15-commissionerscommentol13">
         Except as against purchasers of residential units, there are no formal standards for the effectiveness of a disclaimer clause. All that is necessary under this section is that the disclaimer be calculated to effectively notify the purchaser of the nature of the disclaimer.

        <li id="t34c36.1asIVs34-36.1-4.15-commissionerscommentol14">
         Under subsection (b), general disclaimers of implied warranties are not permitted with respect to purchasers of residential units. However, a declarant may disclaim liability for a specified defect or a specified failure to comply with applicable law in an instrument signed by such a purchaser. The requirement that the disclaimer as to each defect or failure be in a signed instrument is designed to insure that the declarant sufficiently calls each defect or failure to the purchaser’s attention and that the purchaser has the opportunity to consider the effect of the particular defect or failure upon the bargain of the parties. Consequently, this section imposes a special burden upon the declarant who desires to make a “laundry list” of defects or failures by requiring him to emphasize each item on such a list and make its import clear to prospective purchasers. For example, the declarant of a conversion condominium might, consistent with this subsection, disclaim certain warranties for “all electrical wiring and fixtures in the building, the furnace, all materials comprising or supporting the roof, and all components of the air conditioning system.”

         Under subsection (a), the parties may agree that the statute of limitations be reduced to as little as 2 years. However, such a contract provision (which, in the case of residential units, must be reflected in a separate written instrument executed by the purchaser) could, like other contract provisions, be subject to attack on grounds of unconscionability in particular cases.

         Except for warranties of quality which explicitly refer to future performance or duration, a cause of action for breach of a warranty of quality would normally arise when the purchaser to whom it is first made enters into possession. Suit on such a warranty would thus have to be brought within 6 years thereafter. Even an inability to discover the breach would not delay the running of the statute of limitations in this regard.

         Real estate sales frequently include warranties that certain components (e.g., furnaces, hot water heaters, air conditioning systems, and roofs) will last for a particular period of time. In the case of such warranties, the statute of limitations would not start running until the breach is discovered, or, if not discovered before the end of the warranty term, until the end of the term.

        This section provides a general cause of action or claim for relief for failure to comply with the Act by either a declarant or any other person subject to the Act’s provisions. Such persons might include unit owners, persons exercising a declarant’s rights of appointment pursuant to Section [34-36.1-3.03(d)], or the association itself. A claim for appropriate relief might include damages, injunctive relief, specific performance, rescission or reconveyance if appropriate under the law of the state, or any other remedy normally available under state law. The section specifically refers to “any person or class of persons” to indicate that any relief available under the state class action statute would be available in circumstances where a failure to comply with this Act has occurred. This section specifically permits punitive damages to be awarded in the case of willful failure to comply with the Act and also permits attorney’s fees to be awarded in the discretion of the court to any party that prevails in an action.

       If any improvement contemplated in a condominium is labeled “NEED NOT BE BUILT” on a plat or plan, or is to be located within a portion of the condominium with respect to which the declarant has reserved a development right, no promotional material may be displayed or delivered to prospective purchasers which describes or portrays that improvement unless the description or portrayal of the improvement in the promotional material is conspicuously labeled or identified as “NEED NOT BE BUILT.”

         Section [34-36.1-2.09(c)] requires that the plats and plans for every condominium indicate whether or not any improvement that might be built in the condominium must be built. However, Section [34-36.1-4.03] does not require that copies of the plats and plans be provided to purchasers as part of the public offering statement. Consequently, this section requiring the labeling of improvements depicted on promotional material is necessary to assure that purchasers are not deceived with respect to which improvements the declarant is obligated to make in a particular condominium project.

       In the State of Rhode Island, hereinafter referred to as the state, many people are denied equal opportunity in obtaining housing accommodations and are forced to live in circumscribed areas because of discriminatory housing practices based upon race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status, lawful source of income, military status as a veteran with an honorable discharge or an honorable or general administrative discharge, servicemember in the armed forces, country of ancestral origin, disability, age, familial status, or on the basis that a tenant or applicant or a member of the household is, or has been, or is threatened with being the victim of domestic abuse, or that the tenant or applicant has obtained, or sought, or is seeking, relief from any court in the form of a restraining order for protection from domestic abuse. These practices tend unjustly to condemn large groups of inhabitants to dwell in segregated districts or under depressed living conditions in crowded, unsanitary, substandard, and unhealthful accommodations. These conditions breed intergroup tension as well as vice, disease, juvenile delinquency, and crime; increase the fire hazard; endanger the public health; jeopardize the public safety, general welfare, and good order of the entire state; and impose substantial burdens on the public revenues for the abatement and relief of conditions so created. These discriminatory and segregative housing practices are inimical to and subvert the basic principles upon which the colony of Rhode Island was founded and upon which the state and the United States were later established. Discrimination and segregation in housing tend to result in segregation in our public schools and other public facilities, which is contrary to the policy of the state and the constitution of the United States. Further, discrimination and segregation in housing adversely affect urban renewal programs and the growth, progress, and prosperity of the state. In order to aid in the correction of these evils, it is necessary to safeguard the right of all individuals to equal opportunity in obtaining housing accommodations free of discrimination.

The interest in the account shall accrue to the benefit of the tenant. The restoration deposition shall be exempt from § 34-18-19(a) but will be subject to § 34-18-19(b) through (f) inclusive.

        The literal meaning of this section is precise, plain, and clear; therefore, literal reading presumptively gives its correct sense, and that sense cannot be ignored or disregarded merely because the legislature directed in § 34-37-9 that the provisions of the Fair Housing Practices Act shall be liberally construed in order to accomplish its purposes.

        Nothing elsewhere in this act is repugnant to election of this section to prohibit only direct discrimination, nor do the words used to accomplish that effect, when read literally, suggest a meaning which is not sensible, or a result which is absurd, or a purpose which runs counter to the expressed legislative policy of providing equal housing opportunities for all.

       Any complainant, intervener, or respondent claiming to be aggrieved by a final order of the commission may obtain judicial review thereof, and the commission may obtain an order of court for its enforcement, in a proceeding as provided in this section. The proceeding shall be brought in the superior court of the state within any county wherein the unlawful housing practices which are the subject of the commission’s order were committed or wherein any respondent, required in the order to cease and desist from unfair housing practices or to take other affirmative action, resides or transacts business.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c37s34-37-6ol1b">
       The proceeding shall be initiated by the filing of a petition in the court, and the service of a copy of the petition upon the commission and upon all parties who appeared before the commission. Thereupon the court shall have jurisdiction of the proceeding and of the questions determined therein, and shall have power to grant such temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper, and to make and enter upon the pleadings, testimony, and proceedings set forth in the transcript an order enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part the order of the commission.

       An objection that has not been urged before the commission, its member, or agent shall not be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge the objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances.

       If either party shall apply to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence and shall show to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce the evidence in the hearing before the commission, its member, or agent, the court may order the additional evidence to be taken before the commission, its member, or agent and to be made a part of the transcript.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c37s34-37-6ol1e">
       The commission may modify its findings as to the facts, or make new findings, by reason of additional evidence so taken and filed. The commission shall file the modified or new findings and its recommendations, if any, for the modification or setting aside of its original order.

      <li id="t34c37s34-37-6ol1f">
       The jurisdiction of the court shall be exclusive and its judgment and order shall be, when necessary, subject to review by the supreme court as provided by law, to which court appeal from the judgment and order may be made as provided by law.

      <li id="t34c37s34-37-6ol1g">
       The commission’s copy of the testimony shall be available at all reasonable times to all parties without cost of examination and for the purposes of judicial review of the order of the commission. The petition shall be heard on the transcript of the record without requirement of printing.

       If no proceeding to obtain judicial review is instituted by a complainant, intervener, or respondent within thirty (30) days from the service of an order of the commission pursuant to subsection (h) of § 34-37-5, the commission or the complainant may obtain a decree of the court for the enforcement of the order upon showing that respondent is subject to the commission’s jurisdiction, and resides or transacts business within the county in which the petition for enforcement is brought.

       At the present time, many persons have been rendered homeless as a result of economic hardship, a severe shortage of safe, affordable housing, and a shrinking social safety net.

       Article 1, Section 2 of the Rhode Island State Constitution states in part, that “All free governments are instituted for the protection, safety, and happiness of the people. All laws, therefore, should be made for the good of the whole; and the burdens of the state ought to be fairly distributed among its citizens. No person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law, nor shall any person be denied equal protection of the laws.”
      </li>
      <li id="t34c37.1s34-37.1-2ol13">
       Concordant with this fundamental belief, no person should suffer unnecessarily or be subject to unfair discrimination based on his or her homeless status. It is the intent of this chapter to ameliorate the adverse effects visited upon individuals and our communities when the state’s residents lack a home.

       A conservation or preservation restriction may not be terminated or amended in such a manner as to materially detract from the conservation or preservation values intended for protection without the prior approval of the court in an action in which the attorney general has been made a party. Termination may be approved only when it is found by the court that the conservation or preservation restriction does not serve the public interest or publicly beneficial conservation or preservation purpose, taking into account, among other things, the purposes expressed by the parties in the restriction. An amendment that materially detracts from a specific conservation or preservation value intended for protection may be approved only when it is found by the court that the proposed amendment: is between a separate distinct conservation or preservation restriction holder and the fee landowner; creates a net gain in the overall conservation or preservation purpose for which it was intended; and is consistent with the conservation or preservation purposes expressed by the parties in the restriction and the public conservation or preservation interest. No such approval may be sought except with the consent of the holder. If the value of the landowner’s estate is increased by reason of the amendment or termination of a conservation or preservation restriction, that increase shall be paid over to the holder, or to such nonprofit or governmental entity as the court may designate, to be used for the protection of conservation lands or historic resources consistent, as nearly possible, with the stated publicly beneficial conservation or preservation purposes of the restriction.

      The general assembly recognizes and declares that there exists in the state of Rhode Island a serious shortage of decent, safe and sanitary housing units available and affordable to persons and families of low and moderate income. The inadequacy in the supply of decent, safe, and sanitary affordable housing endangers the public health and jeopardizes the public safety, general welfare, and good of the entire state. To obtain the benefits of restrictions which seek to preserve and maintain affordable housing, the general assembly does hereby grant special status to the restrictions so a restriction holder may enforce the restrictions without uncertainty as to the legal effect and enforceability of the restrictions.

        If the time-share instrument provides for voting, it must allocate votes to each time-share unit and to each time-share estate and may allocate votes to any time-share license. It may not allocate any votes to any other property or to any person who is not a time-share owner.

          An agreement to terminate all time-shares in a time-share property must be evidenced by the execution of a termination agreement, or ratifications thereof, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of time-share owners. The termination agreement must specify a date after which the agreement will be void unless it is recorded before that date. A termination agreement and a certification by the managing entity of the ratification thereof must be recorded in every municipal office of land-evidence records in which a portion of the time-share property is situated, and is effective only upon recordation.

Any co-owner of that estate or interest in a unit may thereafter maintain an action for partition or for allotment or sale in lieu of partition pursuant to the laws of this state.

Proceeds of the sale must be distributed to time-share owners with the fractional interests in the time-shares and lienholders as their interests may appear, in proportion to the respective interests of the time-share owners as provided in subsection (e). After the title so vests in the trustee, the time-share owners shall have no further real property ownership interest or other right in and to their former unit, and their interest and rights shall be limited to only the proceeds remaining with the trustee or the registry of the court except as may be provided in subsection (c)(4) of this section.

Following termination, creditors of the association holding liens perfected against the time-share property before the termination may enforce those liens against only the proceeds from the sale of the property in the same manner as any other lienholder. All other creditors of the association are to be treated as if they had perfected liens on the time-share property immediately before termination.

        The termination instrument may specify the respective fractional or percentage interest in the proceeds from the sale of each unit equal to the sum of the time-shares therein that will be owned by each former time-share owner. If specified in the termination instrument, the percentage interests shall be based upon an appraisal of the fair-market value of each time-share by one or more impartial qualified appraisers. Otherwise, not more than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the termination, an appraisal must be made of the fair-market value of each time-share by one or more qualified appraisers selected either by the trustee designated in the termination agreement, or by the managing entity if no trustee was so designated. The appraisal must also state the corresponding fractional or percentage interests calculated in proportion to those values and in accordance with this subsection. A notice stating all of those values and corresponding interests and the return address of the sender must be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, by the managing entity or by the trustee designated in the termination agreements, to all of the time-share owners at their last known address as shown on the records of the association. The appraisal governs the magnitude of each interest and shall be presented to the superior court sitting in the county in which the time-share property is located for review and approval and distribution of the proceeds of the sale pursuant to the termination plan unless (i) At least twenty-five percent (25%) of the time-share owners deliver, within sixty (60) days after the date the notices were mailed, written disapprovals to the return address of the sender of the notice, or (ii) The final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, entered during or after that period, holds that the appraisal should be set aside. The appraisal and the calculation of interests must be made in accordance with the following:

Otherwise, each time-share of that kind must be appraised as if the time until the date specified pursuant to subsection (c) had already elapsed.

         <li id="t34c41asIIs34-41-2.05ol1e2">
          The interest of each time-share owner is the value of the time-share he or she owned divided by the sum of the values of all time-shares in the unit or units to which his or her time-share applies.

To the extent that the time-share instrument is silent with respect to the manner of exercise of any of those powers, the time-share owners may exercise them only by unanimous action.

        For the purposes of this section, “special developer right” means a right reserved for the benefit of a developer to add more units to a time-share property (§ 34-41-2.02(a)(5)); to maintain sales offices, management offices, models, and signs (§ 34-41-2.06); or to appoint, control, or serve as the managing entity.

       With respect to a third person dealing with a trustee, under § 34-41-2.05 or § 34-41-3.08, the existence of trust powers and their proper exercise by the trustee may be assumed without inquiry. A third person is not bound to inquire whether the trustee has power to act as trustee or is properly exercising trust powers, and a third person without actual knowledge that the trustee is exceeding or improperly exercising his or her powers is fully protected in dealing with the trustee as if he or she possessed and were properly exercising the power he or she purports to exercise. A third person is not bound to assure the proper application of trust assets paid or delivered to the trustee in his or her capacity as trustee.

        In the case of a sale of a time share where delivery of a public offering statement is required pursuant to § 34-41-4.02(c), a seller shall, before transferring a time share, record or furnish to the purchaser releases of all liens affecting that time share which the purchaser does not expressly agree to take subject to or assume, or shall provide a surety bond or substantiate collateral for or insurance against the lien as provided for liens on real estate in this title.

After payment, the managing entity may not assess or have a lien against that time-share estate for any portion of the time-share expenses incurred in connection with that lien.

The lienholder shall also forward promptly, by certified or registered mail, a copy thereof to each time-share owner at his or her last known address. The notice does not suffice for the entry of a deficiency or other personal judgment against any time-share owner.

        A developer of a time-share property which includes all or any part of a conversion building, and any person in the business of selling real estate for his or her own account who intends to offer time shares in such a property, shall give each of the residential tenants and any residential subtenant in possession of the proposed time-share units notice of the conversion no later than one hundred twenty (120) days before the developer will require the tenants and any subtenant in possession to vacate. Rents shall not be increased during the notice period. The notice must set forth generally the rights of tenants and subtenants under this section and be hand-delivered to the unit or mailed to the tenant and subtenant at the address of the unit or any other mailing address provided by a tenant. No tenant or subtenant may be required by the developer to vacate upon less than one hundred twenty (120) days’ notice, except by reason of nonpayment of rent, waste, or conduct that disturbs other tenants’ peaceful enjoyment of the premises, and the terms of the tenancy may not be altered during that period. Failure to give notice as required by this section is a defense to an action for possession.

        For sixty (60) days after delivery or mailing of the notice described in subsection (a), the person required to give the notice shall offer to convey each time-share unit or time-share proposed unit occupied for residential use to the tenant who leases that unit. Tenants shall have the right to cancel their lease and receive no penalties for the cancellation as long as all obligations of the lease have been met. If a tenant fails to purchase the unit during the sixty (60) day period, the offeror may not offer to dispose of an interest in that unit during the following one hundred eighty (180) days at a price or on terms more favorable to the offeree than the price or terms offered to the tenant. This subsection does not apply to any unit in a conversion building if that unit will be restricted exclusively to nonresidential use of the boundaries of the converted unit do not substantially conform to the dimension of the residential unit for conversion.

       “Abandon” or “abandonment” means a situation where the owner of a building has intended to abandon the building and has manifested the intent with some act or failure to act. In determining whether an owner has abandoned his or her building, a court shall infer the intent of the owner from the existence of serious code violations that pose a health and/or safety hazard to the community and that have gone unrepaired for an unreasonable amount of time and from any of the surrounding facts and circumstances including, but not limited to the following:
       <ol type="i">

       “Abate” or “abatement” in connection with any property means the removal or correction of any hazardous conditions deemed to constitute a public nuisance and the making of such other improvements as are needed to affect a rehabilitation of the property that is consistent with maintaining safe and habitable conditions over the remaining useful life of the property. However, the closing or boarding up of any building that is found to be a public nuisance is not an abatement of the nuisance.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c44s34-44-2ol13">
       “Building” means any building or structure used for residential purposes or used for retail stores, shops, salesrooms, markets, or similar commercial uses, or for offices, banks, civic administration activities, professional services, or similar business or civic uses.

       “Interested party” means any owner, mortgagee, lienholder, or other entity or person who or that possesses an interest of record in any property that becomes subject to the jurisdiction of the court pursuant to this chapter and any applicant for the appointment of a receiver pursuant to this chapter.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c44s34-44-2ol15">
       “Neighboring landowner” means any owner of property, including any entity or person who or that is purchasing property by land installment contract or under a duly executed purchase contract, that is located within two hundred feet (200´) of any property that becomes subject to the jurisdiction of the court pursuant to this chapter.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c44s34-44-2ol16">
       “Public nuisance” means a building that is a menace to the public health, welfare, or safety; or that is structurally unsafe, unsanitary; or not provided with adequate safe egress; or that constitutes a fire hazard; or is otherwise dangerous to human life; or is otherwise no longer fit and habitable; or that, in relation to existing use, constitutes a hazard to the public health, welfare, or safety by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, or abandonment.

There shall be a hearing at least twenty (20) days after a summons for an injunction, indicating the date and time of the hearing is served upon the owner of the building. The summons shall be served by personal service, residence service, or service by certified mail pursuant to Rule 4 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. If service cannot be made in one of these ways, the notice shall be served by posting it in a conspicuous place on the building and by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality in which the building is located. If the court finds at the hearing that the building is abandoned and either is in a dangerous or unsafe condition or is otherwise in violation of any ordinance or regulation concerning minimum housing standards, it shall issue an injunction requiring the owner to correct the condition or to eliminate the violation, or any other order that it considers necessary or appropriate to correct the condition or to eliminate the violation.

       In any proceeding described in § 34-44-3 of this chapter, if the court makes the finding described in that section and additionally finds that the building in question constitutes a public nuisance and that the owner of the building has been afforded reasonable opportunity to begin correcting the dangerous or unsafe condition found or to begin eliminating the violation found and has refused or failed to do so, the court shall cause notice of its findings to be served upon the owner, each mortgagee or other lienholder of record, and any other interested party, and shall order the parties to show cause why a receiver should not be appointed to perform any work and to furnish any material that reasonably may be required to abate the public nuisance.

The court shall require the party selected to demonstrate the ability promptly to undertake the work required, to provide the judge with a viable financial and construction plan for the rehabilitation of the building, and to post security for the performance of the work. All amounts expended by the party toward abating the public nuisance shall be a lien on the property if the expenditures were approved in advance by the court and if the party desires such a lien. The lien shall bear the interest, and shall be payable upon the terms approved by the court. The lien shall have the same priority as the mortgage of a receiver, as set forth in § 34-44-6, if a certified copy of the court order that approved the expenses, the interest, and the terms of payment of the lien, and a description of the property in question are filed for record, within thirty (30) days of the date of issuance of the order, in the office of the recorder of deeds of the municipality in which the property is located. If the court determines at the hearing that no party can undertake the work and furnish the materials required to abate the public nuisance, or if the court determines at any time after the hearing that any party who is undertaking corrective work pursuant to this chapter cannot or will not proceed, or has not proceeded with due diligence, the judge may appoint a receiver to take possession and control of the property. The receiver shall be appointed in the manner provided in subsection (c).

       No person shall be appointed a receiver unless he or she first has provided the court with a viable financial and construction plan for the rehabilitation of the property in question and has demonstrated the capacity and expertise to perform the required work in a satisfactory manner. Prior to the appointment of a receiver the court may grant access to the property in question to any person who applies to be appointed the receiver of the property, for the limited purpose of developing a viable financial and construction plan for the rehabilitation of the property which shall include the items set forth in § 34-44-4.1. The appointed receiver may be a financial institution that possesses an interest of record in the property, a nonprofit corporation that is duly organized and has as one of its goals the improvement of housing conditions for low and moderate income persons in the municipality in which the property in question is located, or any other qualified property manager who certifies that any rehabilitation of the property in question will not result in the long term displacement of low and moderate income persons.

       The general assembly recognizes, finds and declares that:
       <ol>
        <li id="t34c45s34-45-2ol1a1">
         There exists a serious shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary rental units that are available at rents affordable to low and moderate income families in Rhode Island. Many families are denied access to decent housing because they are unable to meet the higher cost of rent. Rising housing costs in Rhode Island force low and moderate income families to live in unsafe, substandard units; commit such an unreasonably high percentage of their income for rent that they deprive themselves of the other necessities of life; or, worse, find themselves without housing. The inadequacy in the supply of decent, safe and sanitary affordable rental housing endangers the public health and jeopardizes the public safety, general welfare, and good of the entire state.

        <li id="t34c45s34-45-2ol1a2">
         Approximately sixty-seven hundred (6,700) units of housing in sixty-five (65) developments in Rhode Island which are presently affordable to low and moderate income families are in danger of becoming unaffordable due to expiring use restrictions on the property. Low income housing units insured or assisted under §§ 221(d)(3) and 236 of the National Housing Act,

          42 U.S.C.
         </cite>
         § 1437f(c), could be lost as a result of the expiration of the rental assistance contracts; and rural low income housing financed under § 515 of the Housing Act of 1949,

         </cite>
         § 1701 et seq., are threatened with loss as a result of the prepayment of mortgages by owners. The loss of this privately owned and federally assisted housing, which would occur in a period of sharply rising rents on unassisted housing and extremely low production of additional low rent housing, would inflict unacceptable harm on current tenants and would precipitate a grave crisis in the supply of low income housing that was neither anticipated nor intended when contracts for these units were entered into.

       There is, therefore, a compelling need to preserve the affordability of these rental housing units to low and moderate income persons and families in Rhode Island in order to prevent the displacement of these persons and families and to assure an adequate supply of affordable housing for these persons and families in Rhode Island.

      It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a mechanism which will, to the fullest extent possible: (1) preserve the availability and affordability to low and moderate income persons and families of currently available federally insured and assisted housing in the state, and (2) avoid the involuntary displacement of tenants currently residing in federally insured and assisted housing.

      A facility operator shall cease enforcement actions immediately upon any of the following:

       Payment by other lienholders.  A person other than the facility operator who has a lien on the vessel pays the facility operator the full amount necessary to satisfy the lien held by the facility operator. Upon payment by a lienholder of record, the facility operator shall hold the vessel for the benefit of and at the direction of that lienholder and may not deliver possession of the vessel to the vessel owner. Unless the facility operator and the lienholder enter into a new storage agreement, the lienholder shall arrange removal of the vessel from the facility forthwith; or
      </li>
      <li id="t34c46s34-46-6ol13">
       Initiation of civil action.  An owner of a vessel or one claiming ownership rights in the vessel files in a court of competent jurisdiction and serves on the facility operator, not less than ten (10) days before the scheduled date of sale, a complaint against the facility operator relating to the obligations incurred by the storage of the vessel or any claims related to the vessel and in such complaint objects to the enforcement of the lien and sets forth the legal reasons why the lien should not be enforced. The enforcement action shall not resume until either the civil action is resolved or the court enters an order permitting the enforcement action to proceed.

     <p>
      Any person entitled to a lien under this section shall, within sixty (60) days after last furnishing of labor, money, material, or supplies for the production of, altering, or repairing of the personal property, file in the office of the federal aviation administration aircraft registry a statement in writing verified by oath showing the amount of labor, money, material, or supplies furnished for the producing, storage, parking, servicing, altering, or repairing of the personal property, the name of the person for, and by whom labor, money, material, or supplies, was furnished, and specifying the registration number of the aircraft. Unless the person entitled to the lien files the statement within the time provided in this section, he or she is deemed to have waived his or her rights to the lien; provided, however, that the lien provided for in this section does not attach to any personal property after it has been purchased by an innocent purchaser for value, and has passed into his or her possession, unless the lien has been filed with the federal aviation administration aircraft registry before the property was purchased by the purchaser, or he or she has received written notice, from the party entitled to the lien, of his or her intention to file the lien.

The lien shall attach as of the date of the recording of the notice of lien and does not and shall not relate back to the date of the written agreement. If a notice of lien is recorded after the date of recording of an instrument conveying or transferring legal title to the commercial real estate from the party from whom compensation is claimed, then such notice of lien shall not constitute a lien on the interest in commercial real estate held by the transferee.

Such notice of lien shall only be effective as a lien against the transferor’s interest in the commercial real estate to the extent funds are owed to the transferor by the transferee, but the lien shall be effective as a lien against the transferee’s interest in the commercial real estate without limitations described above in this section. A single claim for lien recorded prior to transfer or conveyance of the commercial real estate or interest therein claiming all compensation due in installments shall also be valid and enforceable as it pertains to payments due after the transfer or conveyance; provided however, that as payments or partial payments of compensation are received, the real estate broker shall provide partial releases therefor, thereby reducing the amount due the real estate broker under its lien.

Provided, however, that if a real estate broker claiming a future commission fails to record its notice of lien for future commission prior to the recording of a deed conveying legal title to the commercial real estate to the purchaser or transferee for consideration, then such real estate broker may not claim a lien on the commercial real estate, and any notice of lien recorded subsequent to the recording of such deed shall not constitute a lien on the commercial real estate and shall be null and void and of no effect.

Failure of the plaintiff to provide proper summons or notice shall be grounds for judgment against the plaintiff and in favor of the defendant which is not properly served with summons or notice.
