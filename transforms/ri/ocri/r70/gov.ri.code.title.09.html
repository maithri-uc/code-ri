        Trial justice did not err by sua sponte applying a compensatory damages award to plaintiffs’ R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-2 claim as well as to their wrongful death claim, even though the complaint did not specifically seek compensatory damages. Because the defendant failed to object to the application of compensatory damages, he implicitly consented to the trial justice’s action. Tyre v. Swain,

        In a suit brought by plaintiffs alleging a fraudulent scheme involving annuity insurance investments, the federal district court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim as to plaintiffs’ counts alleging civil liability for crimes and offenses under Rhode Island law because under the pleading standard of Fed. R. Civ. P. 8, the court found that the catchall phrase “any writing whatsoever purporting to contain evidence of any debt, contract, or promise” in R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-17-1 arguably encompassed the annuity applications, which contained evidence of a promise. W. Reserve Life Assur. Co. v. Caramadre,

        Violations of the employer drug testing statute (EDTS), § 28-6.5-1, result in “injuries to the person” as contemplated by the three-year statute of limitations and, accordingly, are subject to the three-year period in § 9-1-14 rather than the 10-year period in § 9-1-13; moreover, actions under this section for civil liability for the victims of criminal offenses, which would include the misdemeanor offense created by the EDTS, are also subject to the three-year statute of limitations. Because an employee filed her action more than three years after the alleged violation of the EDTS, the claims were time-barred. Goddard v. APG Security-RI, LLC,

      A parent may be held liable for injuries caused to his or her unemancipated minor child by the parent’s negligent acts or omissions. In all cases in which the injured minor is living, prior to the commencement of any civil action hereunder, a petition shall be brought in the superior court in the county in which the injured minor resides for the appointment of a guardian ad litem to pursue the action on behalf of the minor. The guardian ad litem shall not be a member of the minor’s family. Once appointed, the guardian ad litem shall be empowered to make all decisions on behalf of the minor relating to the cause of action against the parent. If the minor is deceased, the civil action may be commenced by his or her executor or administrator.

        Where performance was extended by parties beyond a year, and the duration was uncertain, the contract was for an indefinite term, terminable by either party at will and not against the statute of frauds. Powless v. Pawtucket Screw Co.,

        The fact that an agreement is oral rather than written is not enough, standing alone, to bar its enforcement.

        An oral employment contract by which it was agreed that the plaintiff would begin work as soon in the future as possible and that the duration of employment would be one year is not enforceable since the contract could not be performed within one year from the time it was made. Sutcliffe v. Atlantic Mills,

        Oral contract for one year’s service which called for plaintiff to begin work as soon as possible was unenforceable as being within the statute of frauds, since plaintiff was unable to begin his year’s work until four days after the contract was made and therefore the terms of the contract could not be performed within a one-year period from the date of the making of the contract.

        A contract to continue until the plaintiff had made a net profit of $50,000, even if it was necessary to take two years or longer to do it, did not come under the statute, since the money and not the time is the principal object and therefore, it might be performed in a year.

        Defendant was not barred from asserting statute of frauds, even though he pleaded only the general issue and did not object to plaintiff’s evidence of the contract, where plaintiff waived part of pleadings based on said contract, and where it was apparent that the defendant intended to insist upon the statute if plaintiff intended to rely on the waived pleadings.

        Sale of a nursing home which was in the process of construction, the price for which was negotiated on a per bed basis and which required the seller to obtain all licensing necessary for its operation was essentially the sale of a business rather than the sale of real estate within subdivision (6) of this section.

        Since the oral partnership agreement between a father and his children sharing the proceeds of the sale of real property mingled a term subject to the statute of frauds with terms that were not subject to it, the entire agreement was subject to the statute of frauds and was unenforceable.

The defendant’s admission that under the plaintiff’s proposal the plaintiff was to “construct a ‘road’ and ‘bring in utilities’ at its cost” in return for an easement lacks sufficient specificity to establish the elements of the contract, particularly in this instance in which the defendant specifically required participation in formulating the details of a forthcoming agreement.

        Although a son and daughter-in-law initially took possession of a father’s property as renters, their continued possession after the father allegedly made an oral agreement to sell them the property for $70,000 was sufficient to show possession for purposes of constituting the part performance exception to the statute of frauds, R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-4 because a change in the nature of their possession was shown by the father’s entries in ledgers, beginning at the time the oral contract was allegedly made, that reflected weekly payments made by the son and daughter-in-law and deducted from a figure of $70,000.

        Improvements such as landscaping, retiling, and the completion of a sun porch made to a property by a son and daughter-in-law after the father allegedly made an oral agreement to sell them the property for $70,000 were sufficiently substantial to indicate the existence of an enforceable agreement under the part performance exception to the statute of frauds, R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-4; because the improvements were not easily removable, they would have been improvident if made in the absence of an enforceable agreement. Richard v. Richard,

        Instead of manifesting the existence of a contract between the parties, as the plaintiffs contended, correspondence indicating that the defendants did not intend to be bound prior to the execution of a formal contract at some future date did not satisfy the statute of frauds.

        The promise that the plaintiff seeks to enforce is not a lease but the defendants’ promise by their agent that they would negotiate and execute a lease with terms not materially less favorable to the plaintiff than those of the prior, expired lease. This promise is memorialized in the agent’s letter to the plaintiff. Therefore, the promise the plaintiff seeks to enforce is within the requirements of the statute of frauds. De Bourgknecht v.

        The letter contained all the essential elements necessary to constitute a contract; it identified the parties, contained the price, recited the rental terms, fees, and taxes, specified the property, and was signed by the authorized agent; the fact that the letter referred to the drafting of a more formal written agreement did not serve to negate the present existence of a valid agreement.

        Although plaintiff alleged his parents made an oral agreement with him that the family home would pass to him after their deaths upon the fulfillment of certain conditions, defendant, who was plaintiff’s sibling and the executrix of the estate, plaintiff’s sister, and plaintiff’s brother-in-law credibly testified the parties’ mother had told plaintiff the house would be divided among the four children; plaintiff failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence the existence of the oral agreement.

      The owner of real estate who induces a tenant to occupy it by promising to give him or her a lease of the real estate, the term of which is more than one year, shall be liable, if he or she fails or refuses to fulfill his or her promise, for the cost to the tenant of all improvements, repairs, alterations, betterments, and equipment made to, or placed upon the occupied premises, in reliance upon the promise and with the approval of the owner; provided, however, that this section shall not apply in case of a definite letting where rent is reserved or paid, nor in case the unfulfilled promise of the owner is in writing and is itself legally enforceable, nor in case of original or continued occupancy of the premises under a written instrument, signed by the parties. Such costs shall be recoverable by the tenant, his or her heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns, in a civil action for money had and received, brought against the owner, his or her heirs, executors, administrators, successors, or assigns, commenced within one year after the termination of the original tenancy, and not thereafter. Neither the tender of the promised lease after termination of, or notice of intention to terminate, the original tenancy, nor delay during occupancy to begin suit, shall prejudice or defeat the action.

        An administrator could maintain an action against the deceased’s mortgagee who had conveyed the estate for an amount less than the sale price but who had represented to the deceased that the full price had been paid, since by such representations he prevented the deceased from claiming a purchase-money lien which was later lost when the property was conveyed to a bona fide purchaser; such a lien was personal property within the meaning of P.S. 1882, ch. 204, § 8.

        Since the state uniform securities statute, chapter 11 of title 7, was not intended to supersede or replace common-law actions that might rely upon similar facts in seeking compensation for tortious acts committed by a broker or investment advisor, the plaintiff’s common-law claims for breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, and misrepresentation were subject to the 10 year general statute of limitations, not the one year permitted under § 7-11-606.

        A creditor must show an express new promise by the debtor or facts from which such promise can be clearly inferred to avoid application of the statute. Reed v. Johnson,

        The filing of a schedule of debts by the defendant with his petition for the benefit of the insolvent law does not raise a new promise to pay a debt already barred by the statute. Hidden v. Cozzens,

        A promise to “pay him something on account in a few days, if he would wait for him” was sufficient to take the debt out of the statute. Wilcox v. Clarke,

        A promise to pay in instalments a debt barred by the statute of limitations is a qualified promise and hence, the creditor whose debt is barred cannot avail himself of such a promise to sue on a debt until a breach of the promise has occurred. Wiley v. Brown,

        A replication to plea of statute of limitations which stated “that the said defendant within six years next before the commencement of this suit undertake and promise” pointed to a new promise rather than to reliance on the note in its original form. Quincy v. Blanchard,

        Partial payment of a debt is prima facie evidence from which a new promise to pay can be inferred, but circumstances may rebut the inference, still leaving the debt within the statute. Reed v. Johnson,

        Partial payment of a debt by assignee for benefit of creditors does not constitute a new promise so as to take the debt out of the statute, since such an assignee is not an agent of the debtor but a common trustee for all creditors. Reed v. Johnson,

        Unlike § 9-1-13(b), which is unconstitutional because it completely denies court access to product-liability claimants that were injured by a product more than ten years old, § 9-1-14(b), providing that actions for personal injuries shall be commenced within three years after the cause of action accrues, is a reasonable legislative enactment that fully complies with art. 1, sec. 5 of the R.I.

        In a certified question from a federal district court pursuant to R.I. Sup. Ct. art. I, R. 6, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island holds that the one-year statute of limitations of R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-5-17(a) of the Rhode Island Fair Employment Practices Act (FEPA), R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-5-1, applied to employment discrimination cases brought under the Rhode Island Civil Rights Act (RICRA), R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-112-1 et seq., because (1) as the FEPA and the RICRA are in pari materia with respect to employment discrimination claims, harmonization of the two statutes is best achieved by engrafting onto the RICRA the one-year statute of limitations contained in the FEPA, R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-5-17(a); (2) application of the three-year residual statute of limitations of R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14(b) would in effect render meaningless the one-year statute of limitations of R.I. Gen. Laws § 28-5-17(a) contained in the FEPA by allowing plaintiffs an end run around the limitations provision of the latter statute; and (3) FEPA reflects the Rhode Island General Assembly’s weighing of policy considerations and its legislative judgment that one year is the appropriate amount of time within which claims of employment discrimination should be brought, and the Supreme Court of Rhode Island is unable to perceive any adequate reason for not holding that the same legislative determination should be applied to RICRA, bearing in mind that it is a later-enacted statute and (significantly) is silent as to the limitations issue.

        Trial court erred in denying the minor’s motion to amend the complaint and add a defendant, as the motion was not untimely filed; even though the underlying lawsuit had been filed by the minor’s parents, R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-19 tolled the statute of limitations on personal injury actions, found at R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14(b), until such time as the impediment, the minor’s age, was removed at age 18 and, thus, the motion to amend to add a party defendant was timely filed because the minor was less than 18-years-old at the time the motion to amend was filed.

        In a product liability action in which the plaintiff was injured as a result of inhaling fumes from acetic acid that had spilled at her place of employment, whether she had exercised due diligence in her efforts to identify the manufacturer/supplier of the acid was irrelevant to whether the statute of limitations under this section was tolled.

        The tort of intentional interference with a contract is not an “injury to person” and thereby is not subject to the three year statute of limitation; but, rather, is a property interest created by a contract and is thus subject to a ten-year statute of limitations.

        Superior court erred in holding that the statute of limitations barred a customer’s claim for personal injuries that arose from a fall on an insured’s property, where the customer’s first suit against the insured was dismissed and then the customer substituted the insurer under § 27-7-2 in the second suit. The savings statute § 9-1-22, was applicable since the insurer and the insured in this case shared a sufficient commonality of interest to consider them sufficiently linked under the savings statute; and the insurer was aware of the lawsuit, as it had dispatched lawyers to ask the court to dismiss the first action on grounds of inadequate service of process on its insured.

        Superior court did not err in granting defendants’ motion for summary judgment on the ground that the three-year statute of limitations had run before plaintiff and his wife filed their complaint based on his wrongful conviction. Plaintiff’s injuries were first sustained when he was arraigned on October 5, 2007, which was more than three years prior to the April 2012 filing of the complaint; and, even if the discovery rule were applied, plaintiff and his wife knew or should have known of the potential claims at issue, at the latest, at the time of plaintiff’s conviction.

        The accrual of a cigarette product liability action is akin to that of a latent injury case: while the exposure and injury is ongoing, the injuries do not become apparent until the symptoms begin to manifest themselves at a later date. Therefore, a cigarette product liability cause of action accrues when the plaintiff has knowledge, or reasonably should have knowledge, of an injury and a possible causal connection between the injury and the plaintiff’s exposure to cigarette smoke.

        In an employee’s suit alleging that a coworker assaulted the employee, where a district court determined that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the employer and transferred the case from Massachusetts to Rhode Island, and the case was dismissed based on the statute of limitations, the employee’s appeal was rejected because the employee did not challenge the transfer order or the dismissal order; the employee challenged a dismissal order that the district court never made.

        The existence of different limitation periods for suits for negligence and for wrongful death does not violate the equal protection rights of tort victims who die from their injuries, since there is a clear distinction between the nature of the plaintiffs involved which fully supports the state’s decision to treat the two types of plaintiffs differently, i.e., the personal injury plaintiff’s initial need to recover from his injuries and to know the extent of his injuries, the likelihood of the community-disturbing event of death prompting more immediate focus by third parties upon the cause thereof, and the interest of both the survivors and the state in prompt settlement of the affairs of a deceased.

        Where the statute of limitations for personal injuries was extended from two to three years and shortly thereafter the age of majority was reduced from 21 to 18 years, plaintiff argued that the two statutes should be read together so that she would have three years from the time the disability of minority was removed in which to commence her action, but the court held that the action accrued at the time of the injury, and, since that event occurred before either the effective date of the new statute of limitations or its retrospective application provision, the original two-year statute of limitations applied and plaintiff’s suit was untimely.

        Superior court properly granted summary judgment in favor of a condominium association in a pedestrian’s personal injury action because the three-year statute of limitations was not tolled by the provisions of the fictitious name statute, § 9-5-20, where the pedestrian knew the identity of the association before the statutory period expired, and her confusion over the name simply did not change the fact that she knew the identity of the association.

        R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-5-20 did not toll R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14(b) in an employee’s defamation action, based on the employee’s filing of a “John Doe” complaint, because R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-5-20 did not apply, as the employee admitted the employee knew the identity of a detective whose report contained the alleged defamatory statements. Sola v. Leighton,

        When an employee was fired after allegedly defamatory statements about the employee in a detective’s report were published, the employee’s defamation claim was time-barred because the employee’s cause of action did not accrue when the employee was fired but when the statements were published, since the employee’s claim was for defamation, rather than for wrongful termination.

        When an employee was fired after allegedly defamatory statements about the employee in a detective’s report were published, the employee’s defamation claim was time-barred because, when the detective’s report allegedly identified the detective’s source as an employee of the hospital where the employee worked, although the source was not so employed, the detective did not fraudulently conceal the employee’s cause of action, as (1) the detective never identified the informant as a hospital employee, so, if the employee thought the informant was a coworker, the employee did not show the detective created that impression, and, (2) regardless of the informant’s identity, the employee knew when the detective published a report containing information the detective learned from the informant, which gave rise to the employee’s cause of action.

        Plaintiffs’ claims for alleged professional negligence or other negligent wrongdoing, which were based on or related to professional services that the accountants in question allegedly performed or failed to perform, constituted actions for accounting malpractice; thus, such claims had to be brought within one of the statutory time limits specified in R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14.1 for filing accounting malpractice claims, and the absence of contractual privity between plaintiffs and the accountants in question did not remove such professional-negligence claims from the ambit of the accounting-malpractice statute of limitations.

        The statute of limitations barred plaintiffs’ claim for medical malpractice and the wrongful death of plaintiffs’ unborn child, filed eight years following the child’s death, although plaintiffs argued that they had no knowledge of wrongful conduct on defendant’s part until a newspaper article revealed that defendant’s medical license had been recently revoked as a result of malpractice in connection with the death of another infant; had plaintiffs exercised reasonable diligence at the time of their son’s death, any act of alleged negligence on defendant’s part could have been discovered.

        In a medical malpractice case, it was not error to grant a doctor’s motion for judgment as a matter of law, under R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(1), because the suing patient’s action was not filed until the limitations period in R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14.1 had expired, because it was not reasonable for the patient who experienced pain and immobility to wait almost 5 years to see another specialist, even though her workers’ compensation provider had warned her that she risked losing her workers’ compensation if she saw another specialist without its permission, and it did not provide such permission for almost five years.

        Discovery date, for purposes of the statute of limitations, was the date that a plaintiff knew or should have known of the “wrongful act” that was the basis of a lawsuit, and exception was made for an undiscoverable act of medical negligence, as the discovery rule applied to a medical malpractice case in which an injury remained latent for years, undiscoverable by the victim, and an injury was latent and potentially undiscoverable when, exercising “reasonable diligence” at the time of the injury, a plaintiff was unable to discover the wrongful act, neglect or default, but, if a reasonable person in similar circumstances should have discovered that the wrongful conduct of the defendant caused her injuries as of some date before the plaintiff alleged that she made this discovery, then the earlier date would be used to start the running of the limitations period.

        In a medical malpractice case in which a patient and his wife appealed a district court’s entry of summary judgment in favor of various doctors and others, their claim was time-barred by the three-year statute of limitations in R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14.1(2) [now § 9-1-14.1(3)]. The statute of limitations started when they were informed that the results of magnetic resonance imaging revealed a previously undiagnosed mass as a cervical tumor, not when, after the patient’s surgery, the cancerous nature of the tumor was discovered.

        Court could not have determined whether, as a matter of law, reasonable diligence should have uncovered potential wrongdoing by the drug manufacturer prior to October 23, 2006, because it would not have been unreasonable to conclude that as of October 23, 2006, the decedent did not yet have cause to believe she might have had a cause of action against the manufacturer, and the undisputed facts did not show that, while the decedent was aware of an injury due to the drug, she was not in fact conducting reasonable diligence at this time by consulting a series of doctors.

        Insurance malpractice case filed in August 2009 was barred by the three-year statute of limitations because the issue of possible malpractice concerning the lack of UM coverage arose in late 2002, when plaintiff insured received the first coverage update, which he failed to read; the insured also received notice of a renewed policy in February 2006 that he failed to read and other coverage updates. The insured failed to exercise the necessary reasonable diligence when he failed to at least peruse the summary pages of the coverage update, and the large reduction in the premium amount should have alerted him to read the declarations page or contact his agent.

        Because a client’s breach of contract with fraud claim against an attorney, which centered on the attorney’s attempt to obtain a mortgage modification on behalf of the client, was a legal malpractice claim that arose from a professional relationship, the claim was barred by the three-year statute of limitations for legal malpractice claims. The discovery rule did not save the action because the statute of limitations began to run on the foreclosure date as the client admitted that on that date the client knew that the attorney committed negligence.

        Negligent performance of a sterilization procedure which results in the birth of a child is a tort for which recovery may be allowed. Emerson v. Magendantz,

        In an action for negligent sterilization resulting in the birth of a child, plaintiffs would be entitled to recover the medical expenses of the ineffective sterilization procedure, the medical and hospital costs of the pregnancy, the expense of a subsequent sterilization procedure, loss of wages, loss of consortium to the spouse arising out of the unwanted pregnancy, and medical expenses for prenatal care, delivery, and postnatal care. However, no recovery would be allowed for emotional distress arising out of the birth of a healthy child. Emerson v. Magendantz,

        Plaintiff’s contention that her complaint was improperly dismissed because neither R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 8(a) nor R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14.1(2) [now § 9-1-14.1(3)] required her to plead the discovery rule in her complaint was without merit. Since the complaint disclosed on its face that the claim was barred by the statute of limitations, the statute of limitations defense could be raised on a R.I. Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss and plaintiff was required to plead the discovery rule. Barrette v. Yakavonis,

         Relation to Mootness Doctrine.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        State’s appeal of a judgment denying declaratory relief relating to insurance coverage was moot because the underlying case, which involved a medical malpractice claim, had been resolved in favor of defendants; because a three year statute of limitations applied to medical malpractice actions, it was highly unlikely that any more claims relating to the policies at issue would arise, and, therefore, this case did not fall within the limited exception to the mootness doctrine which allowed review of matters of extreme public importance, which were capable of repetition but which evaded review.

        The tolling provision statute, subsection (b) of this section, which assists a plaintiff who is unable in the exercise of reasonable diligence to discover an injury due to medical malpractice, did not apply since the injury was known to the plaintiff, who merely claimed that she did not know the identity of the medicial doctor who might have treated her late husband.

        Tolling provision did not apply to a patient’s medical malpractice suit with regard to her adding an emergency room doctor to the suit four years after the commencement of the action.

        Because a client’s breach of contract with fraud claim against an attorney, which centered on the attorney’s attempt to obtain a mortgage modification on behalf of the client, was a legal malpractice claim that arose from a professional relationship, the claim was barred by the three-year statute of limitations for legal malpractice claims.

        Client’s 2005 legal malpractice action against two attorneys was time-barred by the three-year statute of limitations in R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14.3 because the 1999 dismissal of the client’s Pennsylvania complaint put the client on notice of a potential malpractice claim and the end of the attorney-client relationship, also in 1999, marked a point at which all the facts existed from which the client could discover potential acts of malpractice; the client failed to point to any facts that were only discoverable by reviewing his file in 2004.

        As there was a genuine factual dispute as to when a client learned of her attorney’s alleged malpractice in not advising her that she could achieve her estate plan without causing two lots to merge, and resolution of this dispute determined whether the client’s claim was time-barred under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14.3, or whether it was saved by the discovery rule, § 9-1-14.3(2), the attorney had not been entitled to summary judgment. Sharkey v. Prescott,

        As an attorney’s alleged malpractice in setting up a trust so as to deny his client access to trust principal was discoverable by the client in the exercise of reasonable diligence when the trust was executed, her claim that she did not discover the error until years later was unavailing, and her claim was properly dismissed as time-barred under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14.3. Sharkey v. Prescott,

        Trial court properly determined claims by a decedent’s heirs against a law firm for legal malpractice were time-barred by the three-year limitation period set forth in R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14.3 because the heirs filed the complaint in 2009 and all the facts used to support their allegations of legal malpractice allegedly occurred between February 3, 1976, and May 1987; the discovery rule exception, § 9-1-14.3(2), did not toll the limitations period because the heirs were aware of each act listed in the complaint on or before 1987.

        Client’s legal malpractice claims were barred by the three-year statute of limitations because the client retained an attorney sometime in November 2007, and the attorney represented the client until he withdrew in June 2009, but the client did not file her complaint until April 13, 2012.

        Trial court did not err in concluding that the discovery rule did not toll the statute of limitations because a client was clearly aware of facts that would lead her to believe she had a potential malpractice claim; the client continuously questioned the attorney about the adequacy of his representation.

        Since a client’s legal malpractice claims were barred by the three-year statute of limitations, the client’s claim for fraud was also barred by the three-year statute of limitations because the fraud the client alleged arose from her professional relationship with an attorney.

         Reasonable Diligence.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The general rule requires legal malpractice actions to be brought within three years of the acts or omissions constituting the alleged legal malpractice; however, subsection (b) of this section provides an exception if the legal malpractice could not be discovered through the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time of its occurrence. Thus, a client who sought to recover against an attorney hired to collect on a money judgment should, by exercising reasonable diligence, have had notice shortly after hiring another attorney that his interest in the judgment property was clearly a voidable preference; therefore, the subsequent malpractice action was barred by the three-year statute of limitations. Penn-Dutch Kitchens v. Grady,
        <cite class="ocri">
         651 A.2d 731

       </p>
       <p>
        If the plaintiff had exercised reasonable diligence instead of waiting several months to begin his quest for copies of the pertinent instructions, the plaintiff could have discovered any alleged infirmities in the requested jury instructions, as well as the final jury instructions, well before his receipt of the judge’s instructions. As a result, subsection (b) did not act to extend the commencement date of the three-year statute of limitations. Therefore, the operative date for the purposes of commencing the statute of limitations occurred no later than when the jury returned its verdict at the conclusion of the trial. Guay v. Dolan,
        <cite class="ocri">

        As soon as plaintiffs learned that a deed conveying the property had been recorded, they believed they were wronged because they had not consented to or authorized the sale, and thus they were required to determine what claims they had against the parties involved; plaintiffs could not avoid the three-year statute of limitations or seek application of the discovery-rule exception under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14.3(2) by faulting their bankruptcy attorneys, and plaintiffs wholly failed to satisfy the reasonable diligence standard of the statute. Fogarty v. Palumbo,

        The plaintiff filed suit in federal district court on a date beyond the three-year statutory period. Since the complaint filed in federal district court was itself time barred, its filing could not toll the statute of limitations. Guay v. Dolan,

        Since the nonresident motorist is subject to service and process under §§ 31-7-6 and 31-7-7, the statute of limitations on personal injury claims is not tolled under this section and the plaintiff must commence an action against the defendant within three years after the action accrues.

        The general disability tolling statute, this section, does not affect or supercede the provisions of § 9-1-14.1, which contains its own provisions addressing the effects of any disabilities on limitations of actions. Bakalakis v. Woman &amp; Infants' Hosp.,

        Trial court erred in denying the minor’s motion to amend the complaint and add a defendant, as the motion was not untimely filed; even though the underlying lawsuit had been filed by the minor’s parents, R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-19 tolled the statute of limitations on personal injury actions, found at R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14(b), until such time as the impediment, the minor’s age, was removed at age 18 and, thus, the motion to amend to add a party defendant was timely filed because the minor was less than 18-years-old at the time the motion to amend was filed.

         Unsound Mind.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The “unsound mind” tolling provision in this section refers to a mental condition that renders a person incompetent or incapable of managing his or her everyday affairs and does not encompass more limited impairments such as a selective inability to recall particular facts or a reluctance to seek legal redress based upon those facts. Smith v. O'Connell,
        <cite class="ocri">
         997 F. Supp. 226
        </cite>
        ,
        <cite class="ocri">
         1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3456

         1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 18396
        </cite>
        (1st Cir. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        A conclusion that “unsound mind” refers to a condition that renders a plaintiff incapable of managing his everyday affairs is consistent with judicial interpretations of the term in other contexts and with the rule of statutory construction that exceptions in statutes of limitations in favor of disabled persons are strictly construed. Kelly v. Marcantonio,
        <cite class="ocri">
         187 F.3d 192
        </cite>
        ,

         1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 18396
        </cite>
        (1st Cir. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        To establish the disability of unsound mind, for purposes of tolling the statute of limitations, a party must demonstrate an inability to manage one’s day-to-day affairs. Roe v. Gelineau,
        <cite class="ocri">
         794 A.2d 476
        </cite>
        ,

        (R.I. 2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        While repressed recollection could establish the disability of unsound mind, for purposes of tolling a statute of limitations, an alleged sexual abuse victim did not present sufficient evidence to require a hearing on whether his alleged repressed recollection constituted an unsound mind.

        Where a husband did not file a defamation and malicious prosecution suit for seven years after the husband was arrested for disorderly conduct based on allegations made by the acquaintances, and where the husband did not show that he was of unsound mind when the action accrued in accordance with R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-19, the statutes of limitations in R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14 were not tolled and the acquaintances were entitled to summary judgment. Austin v. Carden,

        Plaintiffs’ sexual assault and conspiracy suit against a church and officials was barred by the three-year statute of limitations in R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14(b) because: (1) they filed suit more than 10 years after the statutory period had run; and (2) the statute was not tolled since, inter alia, plaintiffs did not contend that the applicable statute of limitations should be tolled by virtue of the “unsound mind” disability provision.

        The inability to recall incidents of sexual abuse may constitute a disability that extends the time within which claims for resulting injury may be brought. The trial court, after hearing and considering expert medical and scientific evidence and opinion, must decide in the first instance, as a matter of law, whether the alleged repressed recollection in a particular case is sufficiently relevant, reliable, and scientifically and/or medically established so as to constitute “unsound mind,” thereby tolling the action limitation period. Kelly v. Marcantonio,
        <cite class="ocri">

       <p>
        A temporary inability to remember alleged acts of sexual abuse, failure to recognize those acts as tortious, or a difficulty in overcoming a reluctance to “re-live” the matter by initiating legal action did not constitute a condition of “unsound mind” that tolled the period of limitations.

        To the extent that prior case law left open the option that repressed recollection, standing alone, could toll the statute of limitations with respect to nonperpetrator defendants, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island now forecloses it and holds that, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-19, repressed recollection, in and of itself, is not a viable tolling mechanism against nonperpetrator defendants in childhood sexual abuse cases. In the Supreme Court’s opinion, reading R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 9-1-19 and 9-1-51 together makes it clear that § 9-1-51 sets forth the exclusive means by which the statute of limitations can be tolled based on the repressed recollection of childhood sexual abuse.

        Even if the hierarchy defendants’ silence qualified as an “actual misrepresentation,” where the plaintiffs did not allege that those defendants’ silence misled them into believing that the alleged sexual abuse did not occur, that it had not been committed by priests, or that it had not resulted in injury to the plaintiffs, but rather argued that the silence concealed from them an additional theory of liability, their argument missed the point that for a cause of action to accrue the entire theory of the case need not be immediately apparent.

        Superior court erred in holding that the statute of limitations barred a customer’s claim for personal injuries that arose from a fall on an insured’s property, where the customer’s first suit against the insured was dismissed and then the customer substituted the insurer under § 27-7-2 in the second suit. The savings statute, § 9-1-22, was applicable since the insurer and the insured in this case shared a sufficient commonality of interest to consider them sufficiently linked under the savings statute; and the insurer was aware of the lawsuit, as it had dispatched lawyers to ask the court to dismiss the first action on grounds of inadequate service of process on its insured.

        The plaintiff’s claim that the statute of limitations was tolled because, through the filing of the petition for the perpetuation of testimony the defendant had knowledge of the possibility of a wrongful-death claim being brought against it, was without merit. There is no provision for any type of constructive notice to a defendant for purposes of tolling an applicable statute of limitations. Benner v. J.H. Lynch &amp; Sons,

        Although the three-year limitation contained in this section continues to apply in actions brought against the state, the discovery rule contained in § 10-7-2 is also applicable to wrongful-death actions brought against the state. Benner v. J.H. Lynch &amp; Sons,
        <cite class="ocri">

        Judgment was properly awarded to a town in plaintiffs’ negligence action for failing to delete an arrest warrant from the town’s computer system; the three-year statute of limitations had expired before plaintiffs brought their action and one plaintiff’s answers to interrogatories showed that plaintiffs were aware of the alleged negligence at the time it occurred. Illas v. Przybyla,

       <p>
        Courts interpret the term “accrue” in R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-25 in three ways: (1) the statute runs from the time the negligent action occurred; (2) the statute runs at the time the injury first became apparent; and (3) the statute runs at the time the plaintiff discovered the injury or, through reasonable diligence, should have discovered it.

        The two-year limitation period provided by this section represents the state’s effort to regulate actions commenced against municipalities; it stems from the premise that although governmental entities are not immune from tort liability, they may qualify their liability by establishing the terms and conditions of such actions.

        Fire marshal’s investigator who also drew a fire department disability pension failed to show actionable defamation or appropriation of his likeness by a broadcaster whose investigative reporter questioned the propriety (legality of the practice was not in question) of what might have been perceived as double dipping, and summary judgment was properly entered in the broadcaster’s favor, since there was nothing defamatory about exercising the right of fair comment regarding true facts; rebroadcast of an excerpt from the original broadcast for promotional purposes was not an actionable invasion of privacy because the original broadcast had not been defamatory, and a voice over comment suggesting the investigator and others might be doing something wrong was insufficient to change that earlier characterization as not defamatory.

        A private college’s continual inquiry into the progress of a student’s diet and scrutiny of her personal weight-loss records constituted conduct which a trier of fact could reasonably find offensive or objectionable, and the college was therefore not entitled to summary judgment in the student’s action for invasion of privacy.

        For a right to privacy action in tort to lie, plaintiffs must demonstrate that they actually expected a disclosed fact to remain private, and that society would recognize this expectation of privacy as reasonable and be willing to respect it. Pontbriand v. Sundlun,

        Subsection (a)(1) only protects against an invasion of “one’s solitude or seclusion,” neither of which is present when activity takes place outside one’s house in public view. Swerdlick v. Koch,

        Summary judgment for the defendant was denied where the plaintiff alleged that the defendant burst into her apartment and raped her, since such behavior could qualify as an “invasion of something that is entitled to be private or would be expected to be private,” and as “offensive or objectionable to a reasonable man,” thus satisfying the statutory test for a violation of the state privacy act.

        Where city employees alleged that a city and its officials violated their right to privacy under R.I. Gen.

        Trial court properly dismissed an employee’s action, alleging a violation of her right to privacy under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-28.1(a)(1), as an officer for the employee’s conduct was inappropriate and offensive where he pushed a price sticker onto the employee’s shoulder upon being annoyed with the placement of the sticker on a store item, but it was not statutorily actionable; the employee did not establish that she threw about her person a seclusion that merited an expectation of privacy.

        In a citizen’s civil action alleging the unauthorized publication of a sealed criminal record, the trial court correctly found against the citizen on his claim alleging a violation of the right-to-privacy statute, R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-28.1, because the citizen failed to establish that a private fact was unlawfully published where the proverbial cat had already been let out of the bag before an officer disclosed any details of the citizen’s arrest. The citizen had already disclosed to a friend that he had been arrested and had responded to a reporter that the charges against him were bogus. Tarzia v. State,

        Plaintiff’s invasion-of-privacy claim failed as a matter of law because he failed to set forth the publication of any false or fictitious fact by any defendant as plaintiff’s transfer and demotion were a matter of public knowledge; plaintiff could only point to an interoffice memoranda between defendants in support of his claim; and the events on which his claim was premised actually occurred.

        Given the respect which the state courts accord the restatement of torts on matters of privacy law otherwise unresolved by state law, the district court concluded that state courts would adopt the restatement’s rule that corporations do not enjoy privacy rights, and that the false light action filed by the plaintiff failed as a matter of law.

        Judgment for a bank was proper in a borrower’s claim of privacy violation under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-28.1 because, although the borrower claimed that the bank improperly disclosed her mortgage balance, the borrower never established at trial that any disclosure was made; further, considering the bank’s interests, the amount owed by borrower owed on the mortgage was not private information that society would have recognized as protected. The buyer of the property at a foreclosure sale, although not personally liable for the balance of the loan to the bank, risked losing title to the property had the loan not been paid, and the bank had a legal interest in the property dating to 1978, when the borrower and her then-husband undertook the mortgage.

Thus, the statute protects improvers of real property from tort liability for work that has been substantially completed for ten years. Boghossian v. Ferland Corp.,

        Because the teacher failed to comply with the requirement of applying to the retirement system for whatever benefits may be appropriate for a teacher in her situation, the teacher thereby precluded herself from receiving the full-salary payment provided for by subsection (d). Accordingly, the teacher was required to reimburse the school committee for all amounts paid to her after the one-year anniversary date of her injury, in excess of that amount required to be paid to her by the collective-bargaining agreement, together with interest thereon at the legal rate from the date such payments were made.

        Under this section, if a subsequent alteration or modification to a product is a “substantial cause” of a plaintiff’s injuries, the defendant is completely immune from a products liability claim even if the product was defective at the time it left the defendant’s control, and the defect was a proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injuries. Thus, because there was evidence that changes had been made to the vehicle between the time of its initial sale and the time of the plaintiff’s accident, the defense provided by this section should have been communicated to the jury.

       Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, an insured under any insurance policy as set out in the general laws or otherwise may bring an action against the insurer issuing the policy when it is alleged the insurer wrongfully and in bad faith refused to pay or settle a claim made pursuant to the provisions of the policy, or otherwise wrongfully and in bad faith refused to timely perform its obligations under the contract of insurance. In any action brought pursuant to this section, an insured may also make claim for compensatory damages, punitive damages, and reasonable attorney fees. In all cases in which there has been no trial in the superior court on or before May 20, 1981, the question of whether or not an insurer has acted in bad faith in refusing to settle a claim shall be a question to be determined by the trier of fact.

        An insurer may avoid liability by bringing a declaratory judgment action in order to clarify coverage terms without the action necessarily being viewed as a bad-faith maneuver.

Laws § 9-1-33 provides that the question of whether or not an insurer has acted in bad faith in refusing to settle a claim shall be a question to be determined by the trier of fact; that is, bad faith is established when the proof demonstrates that the insurer acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law. Further, a plaintiff need not establish entitlement to a judgment as a matter of law on a breach of contract claim in order to establish bad faith. Skaling v. Aetna Ins. Co.,

        Regarding whether pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-33 a realty corporation could assign its bad faith claim against the insurance company to the purported assignee, who was hurt when a step on the realty company’s property collapsed injuring the purported assignee, no bad faith showing was in fact made since the insurance company’s liability to the realty company was “fairly debatable” since it was not clear that the realty company was an insured under the relevant insurance policy.

        An insurance company’s fiduciary obligations include not only the duty to act in good faith, but also a duty to act in the best interests of the insured, and the company therefore must consider seriously a plaintiff’s reasonable offer to settle within the policy limits.

        Unless a spouse or child of an impaired party (the “deprived parties”) can show that joinder of their derivative claims for loss of consortium, society, and companionship with those of the impaired party was not feasible before the impaired party settled, arbitrated, or litigated his or her claims, the deprived parties must join their claims with those of the impaired party before an arbitration award or judgment adjudicating the impaired party’s claims has become final, whichever event first occurs.

        The Rhode Island Supreme Court has held that an action for loss of consortium under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-41 is a derivative claim that is attached to the claims of an injured spouse or parent. Such action arises from the injured spouse or parent’s physical injury and is dependent upon the success of the underlying tort claim. Therefore, if a husband or father has no right to recover against a defendant, it follows that a plaintiff wife or child has no such right either. Forest v. Pawtucket Police Dep't,

        In an action that a patron and his wife brought against a tavern owner to recover for injuries resulting from the patron’s fall down stairs at the tavern, summary judgment on the spouse’s claim for loss of consortium was inappropriate because there were genuine factual disputes with respect to the patron’s claims against the tavern owner and the spouse’s claims were derivative in nature.

        Because plaintiff’s wife was not a party to his lawsuit, there was no evidence of any successful tort action by her against defendant, and plaintiff’s underlying abuse of process claim failed, his claim for loss of consortium under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-41 was bootless, there having been nothing upon which such a derivative claim could have been based. Fiorenzano v. Lima,

        The assertion of one spouse’s right to a personal injury claim within the statutory period of limitations will not allow for the introduction of the other spouse’s expired loss of consortium claim through an amended complaint; such a claim, in effect, does not relate back to the original, timely filed complaint.

        Loss of consortium and loss of society claims arise because an injured spouse, parent or child, due to a tortious injury, can no longer supply the affection, companionship and society natural to such a relationship.

        Plaintiffs’ assertions that because a jury found in their favor on a breach of contract claim, they were entitled to attorney’s fees pursuant to R.I. Gen.

        In a contractor’s breach of contract action against a project owner, the court entered judgment in favor of the contractor because it sufficiently supported its breach of contract claim and awarded the contractor prejudgment interest under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-21-10 on the compensatory damages award. The court declined to award either party attorney’s fees and costs under R.I. Gen.

      In any suit for damages as a result of personal injuries, a homemaker may recover the fair value of homemaker services provided to the home and those living therein. A “homemaker” as used herein is a person who has primary responsibility for the care of a home and a family and who receives no direct monetary compensation for those duties. The fair value of homemaker services shall not be limited to money actually expended to replace the services usually provided by the homemaker. In such a suit, the value of the homemaker services may be shown by expert testimony, but such testimony is not required.

        In an action against an insurance company seeking punitive damages and interest for failure to make a settlement payment within 30 days, evidence that a check had been timely issued by the company overcame the presumption of willful and wanton disregard for the rights of the claimant, and summary judgment in favor of the company was proper.

        The time within which a claim for injury resulting from sexual abuse of a minor must be brought is governed by § 9-1-14(b) (limitation of action for personal injury), not this section (limitation of action based on sexual abuse), when the claim is asserted against someone other than the alleged abuser (e.g., against the abuser’s employer).

        The legislature’s decision not to incorporate a discovery provision in § 9-1-14(b) at the same time that it enacted the discovery provision in this section evinced an intent that claims governed by the former provision continue to be considered as accruing at the time of injury.

        To the extent that prior case law left open the option that repressed recollection, standing alone, could toll the statute of limitations with respect to nonperpetrator defendants, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island now forecloses it and holds that, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-19, repressed recollection, in and of itself, is not a viable tolling mechanism against nonperpetrator defendants in childhood sexual abuse cases. In the Supreme Court’s opinion, reading R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 9-1-19 and 9-1-51 together makes it clear that § 9-1-51 sets forth the exclusive means by which the statute of limitations can be tolled based on the repressed recollection of childhood sexual abuse.

        Plaintiffs’ sexual assault and conspiracy suit against a church and officials was barred by the three-year statute of limitations in R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-14(b) because: (1) they filed suit more than 10 years after the statutory period had run; and (2) R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-51 provided no relief since it did not apply to claims against nonperpetrator defendants and their reason for delay was not objectively reasonable. Ryan v. Roman Catholic Bishop,

Such a showing shall be conducted in camera.

Any payment to a person under the first or second sentence of subsection (d)(1) shall be made from the proceeds. The person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses that the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. The state shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses which the court finds to have been necessarily incurred by the attorney general, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, and the amount received shall be deposited in the false claims act fund created under this chapter. All expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.

         If the state does not proceed with an action under this section, the person bringing the action or settling the claim shall receive an amount the court decides is reasonable for collecting the civil penalty and damages. The amount shall be not less than twenty-five percent (25%) and not more than thirty percent (30%) of the proceeds of the action or settlement and shall be paid out of the proceeds. The person shall also receive an amount for reasonable expenses the court finds to have been necessarily incurred, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. All expenses, fees, and costs shall be awarded against the defendant.

         Whether or not the state proceeds with the action, if the court finds that the action was brought by a person who planned and initiated the violation of § 9-1.1-3 upon which the action was brought, then the court may, to the extent the court considers appropriate, reduce the share of the proceeds of the action the person would otherwise receive under subsection (d)(1) or (d)(2), taking into account the role of that person in advancing the case to litigation and any relevant circumstances pertaining to the violation. If the person bringing the action is convicted of criminal conduct arising from his or her role in the violation of § 9-1.1-3, that person shall be dismissed from the civil action and shall not receive any share of the proceeds of the action. The dismissal shall not prejudice the right of the state to continue the action.

         If the state does not proceed with the action and the person bringing the action conducts the action, the court may award to the defendant its reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses if the defendant prevails in the action and the court finds that the claim of the person bringing the action was clearly frivolous, clearly vexatious, or brought primarily for purposes of harassment.

        Under the Uniform Commercial Code a transferee may assert such rights as could have been asserted by a transferor. Further, an assignee even of a nonnegotiable chose in action that has been assigned in writing may maintain an action thereon in his own name, but subject to all defenses and rights of counterclaim, recoupment, or setoff to which a defendant would have been entitled had the action been brought in the name of an assignor. Certainly an assignee of a negotiable instrument that has not been negotiated by endorsement should have no lesser right subject to all statutory and common-law defenses.

        Trial court acted within its discretion in denying city’s motion for judgment on partial findings based on a city’s argument that a taxpayer lacked standing to prosecute tax appeals for certain years when it did not own the property because: (1) the taxpayer was aggrieved within the meaning of R.I. Gen. Stat. § 44-5-26(a) and its standing flowed from its status as a successor-in-interest to the prior owner; and (2) R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-2-8 impliedly authorized the assignment because the transfer of the appeals appeared to be a market assignment involving a finite, purely economic transaction. Weybosset Hill Invs., LLC v.

        R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-2-8 applied to a sub-subcontractor’s (SSC) action against a general contractor, as the SSC’s claim was a nonnegotiable “chose in action”; the fact that the claim might serve as security for a negotiable instrument was immaterial.

        As none of the documents provided by a sub-subcontractor referred to its claim against a general contractor, they did not constitute a written assignment of that claim, as required by R.I.

        Where plaintiff sued on contract for sale of stock, and the signatures of defendants to the contract were followed by the words “trustees under clause of will” or “trustees under indenture of trust,” such pleading was not subject to demurrer on ground that defendants are not personally liable since the questions of whether such words appearing after the signature of defendants showed that they were signing in a representative capacity, or were merely descriptio personae, were questions of fact which required the introduction of evidence. 91065 Corp. v.

        Since under Rhode Island practice a suit against a union may be brought either under the provisions of this section or under the common law by naming all the members of the union it is proper in federal court to sue such union by naming only a portion of the members of the union as a suit by representation under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(a)(1), notwithstanding the fact that the officers named by this section were not included.

       <p>
        Continuance to allow a wrongful death defendant to obtain new trial counsel was properly denied because the trial justice properly balanced the aged parents’ interest in an accelerated trial of their wrongful death claim, to which they were entitled under R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 9-2-18 and 9-2-20. The defendant was well apprised of the fact that he might be without counsel, and he had made little effort to obtain counsel who could take over his case without requesting yet another continuance.

        Where bill of discovery failed to give any particulars as to the manner in which notice of the attorney-client relationship was “filed” or to state the means employed to bring the matter to the attention of the parties, such indefinite and general allegations do not aid the court in determining either that the attorneys are entitled to the information sought by the bill or that such information is relevant, material and necessary to the prosecution of their claim.

      Every association, corporation, or other institution, including a municipal corporation, maintaining a hospital in the state, which shall furnish medical or other service to any patient injured by reason of an accident not covered by the workers’ compensation act, shall, if the injured party shall assert or maintain a claim against another for damages on account of the injuries, have a lien upon that part going or belonging to the patient, of any recovery or sum had or collected or to be collected by the patient, or by his or her heirs or personal representatives in the case of his or her death, whether by judgment or by settlement or compromise, to the amount of the reasonable and necessary charges of the hospital up to the date of payment of the damages; provided, however, that the lien herein set forth shall not be applied or considered valid against anyone coming under the workers’ compensation act in this state; and, provided, further, that nothing herein enacted shall be so construed as to give the lien herein created precedence over the lien of an attorney.

       <p>
        Under the doctrine of forum non conveniens, when an alternative forum has jurisdiction to hear a case, and when trial in the chosen forum would establish oppressiveness and vexation to a defendant out of all proportion to plaintiff’s convenience, or when the chosen forum is inappropriate because of considerations affecting the court’s own administrative and legal problems, the court may, in the exercise of its sound discretion, dismiss the case on
        <i>
         forum non conveniens
        </i>
        grounds, even if jurisdiction and proper venue are established. Kedy v. A.W. Chesterton Co.,

        (R.I. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        The forum non conveniens inquiry consists of a two-prong analysis. First, the court must decide whether an alternative forum exists that is both available and adequate to resolve the disputed legal issues. Second, the court must determine the inconvenience of continuing in the plaintiff’s chosen forum by weighing private- and public-interest factors. The defendant carries the burden of persuasion at each stage of the

        Although jurisdiction and venue existed in Rhode Island as to asbestos litigation cases that were brought by Canadian residents against corporations that did business in Rhode Island, dismissal of the cases was proper because the private-interest and public-interest factors favored the dismissal of the cases under the doctrine of forum non conveniens in spite of the deference to which the alleged victims’ choice of forum was entitled.

        Notice of intention to file a bill of exceptions out of time would avail the plaintiff nothing in view of the meager record before the court, for to allow him to merely file a notice of intention out of time, which is all plaintiff prayed for, would still leave him without an exception to the decision.

        Trial justice did not abuse his discretion in denying petition filed pursuant to this section where there was no transcript of any testimony and apparently none was taken in the superior court to show on what other ground, if any, plaintiff relied to prove “accident, mistake or unforeseen cause” prescribed in the statute besides the showing made by the joint affidavit of counsel of lack of notice of the entry of the court’s rescript.

        Lis pendens is not a lien but merely puts all prospective purchasers on notice that there is a suit pending involving an issue of title to certain real property, and therefore due process of law does not mandate notice and an opportunity to be heard before the filing of a notice of lis pendens under this section. George v. Oakhurst Realty,
        <cite class="ocri">
         414 A.2d 471
        </cite>
        ,
        <cite class="ocri">
         1980 R.I. LEXIS 1557
        </cite>
        (R.I. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section is not unconstitutional as a violation of the due process clauses of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions since there is no significant taking of property and the extent of the state’s involvement in the filing of a notice of lis pendens is minimal. Darr v. Muratore,
        <cite class="ocri">
         143 B.R. 973
        </cite>
        ,

         1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12794
        </cite>
        (D.R.I. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if the filing of a notice of lis pendens constituted a taking with sufficient state involvement, the Rhode Island lis pendens procedure provides adequate constitutional safeguards since this section specifies that a plaintiff shall give notice to all named parties within seven days after recording a notice of lis pendens, and a defendant may subsequently file a motion to quash an improperly filed lis pendens; there is no constitutional requirement that the landowner be given a hearing before the notice of lis pendens is filed.

        A notice filed by plaintiff which stated that in event of a favorable decree on a bill for accounting a levy would be made on certain real estate belonging to defendants was null and void since bill did not concern the title to real estate. Campbell v. Metcalf,
        <cite class="ocri">

       </p>
       <p>
        The plaintiff’s act of filing a lis pendens was done maliciously since it was filed as a calculated attempt to coerce the defendant into paying her the money she believed past due and owing to her, rather than a legitimate endeavor to preserve her claimed ownership interest in the property in question. A lis pendens may not be used as a substitute for an attachment to collect an alleged indebtedness. Montecalvo v. Mandarelli,

     </h3>
     <p>
      The plaintiff in any action may, as often as may be necessary, at any time before final judgment in the action, sue out a writ of mesne process to be made returnable to the court in which the action is then pending, the writ of mesne process commanding the attachment of the real or personal estate of the defendant, including his or her personal estate in the hands or possession of any person, partnership, or corporation, as the trustee of the defendant, and his or her stock or shares in any banking association or other incorporated company, and may also sue out a writ of mesne process commanding the arrest of the defendant unless the defendant has been arrested in the action; provided, that the plaintiff, his or her agent, or attorney shall make affidavit, to be endorsed on or annexed to the writ, setting forth facts which would authorize an attachment or arrest at the commencement of the action. The writ of mesne process shall conform, as nearly as may be, to a writ of attachment or arrest issued at the commencement of an action and shall be returnable at a time, before final judgment, to be specified in the writ.

        Since the form of the writ and the procedure in replevin are both prescribed by statute and neither the writ nor the statute contains any direction to the officer as to the course to be pursued in event of claim by a third person, the officer was fully justified in proceeding with the service of the writ.

        Writ and declaration in replevin in which the words “original writ” were omitted after the words “provided the same is not taken, attached, or detained upon,” and before the words “mesne process, warrant of distress, or upon execution” was fatally defective. Parker v. Palmer,

        A writ of replevin which omitted the words “original writ” was not defective in the sense that plaintiff in replevin who himself was responsible for it could take advantage, but on the contrary a judgment for return and restoration would be good against the plaintiff in replevin in spite of such defect.

        Because Rhode Island has extended its longarm statute, § 9-5-33, to the extent permitted by the federal constitution, there are no separate state statutory requirements for the exercise of jurisdiction.

        The so-called “gestalt” factors include the burden on the defendant, the forum state’s interest in adjudicating the dispute, the plaintiff’s interest in obtaining the most effective resolution of the controversy, and the shared interest of the several states in furthering fundamental substantive social policies; these considerations sometimes serve to establish the reasonableness of jurisdiction upon a lesser showing of minimum contacts than would otherwise be required. However, these factors do not even come into play until it has been shown that a defendant has purposefully established minimum contacts with the forum state. Cerberus Partners, L.P. v.

        Rhode Island superior court erred in its exercise of personal jurisdiction over the Ohio trustee as a nonresident defendant because the beneficiaries did not show that the trustee engaged in the business of administering the trust in Rhode Island nor that their claims against the trustee arose out of its contacts with Rhode Island; thus, the trustee’s conduct and connection with Rhode Island were such that it should not reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.

        Trial court did not err in dismissing an employee’s suit against a coworker based on lack of in personam jurisdiction because the coworker’s contacts with Rhode Island were on behalf of the coworker’s employer and were not sufficiently systematic or continuous to warrant an exercise of jurisdiction pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-5-33(a); the mere fact that the coworker was in Rhode Island to make deliveries in connection with the coworker’s employment was not sufficient to establish specific jurisdiction.

        Personal jurisdiction did not exist in Rhode Island when a provider, who was a Rhode Island resident, sought to recover rescinded funds from a client, who was a resident of Florida, and from a bank, which was in Texas. The bank did not have sufficient affiliations with Rhode Island and did not purposefully avail itself of Rhode Island law, while litigation as to the client in Rhode Island would have offended traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.

        In an action to enforce the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, a Rhode Island union failed to allege facts sufficient to support a finding of in personam jurisdiction over a nursing home located in Massachusetts which was neither licensed nor registered to do business in Rhode Island; maintained no telephone listing, office or bank accounts in Rhode Island; had no employees working in Rhode Island; had no real property interests in the state; paid no state taxes; did not have a registered agent for service of process; and did not currently advertise in Rhode Island, even though one of the nursing home’s largest medical supply vendors was located in Rhode Island, some members of the union’s bargaining unit were Rhode Island citizens, and the nursing home may have solicited business from the VA hospital while acting as a contract nursing home or may have solicited patients in Rhode Island.

        The mere fact that a company produces and/or ships raw material into this country to a non-Rhode Island destination where it is then incorporated by an independent entity into a product that is in turn shipped by that entity into Rhode Island does not in and of itself constitute sufficient minimum contacts for Rhode Island to exercise personal jurisdiction over the original producer and/or shipper of the raw materials.

        In an employment discrimination action against an employer and the employer’s parent corporation, the parent corporation was not subject to personal jurisdiction in Rhode Island since (1) the plaintiff did not establish that her discrimination claim was at all related to conduct by the parent corporation in Rhode Island, and (2) the plaintiff has failed to establish that the parent corporation engaged in a continuous and systematic course of conduct in Rhode Island and that her claims arose from such contacts.

        Rhode Island may not exercise general jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant unless the defendant’s contacts with the state are continuous, purposeful, and systematic. General jurisdiction over an out of state law firm did not exist where: (1) the firm’s only contact with Rhode Island was a website that advertised to clients all over the world and pro hac vice appearances in Rhode Island courts by 10 different lawyers in 6 different cases over a 7 year span; (2) the law firm maintained no office in Rhode Island; (3) it neither owned nor leased property in the state; (4) it maintained no records in the state; (5) it had neither an agent, telephone number, nor a mailbox in the state; (6) none of its attorneys were licensed to practice in Rhode Island; and (7) it did not recruit personnel in Rhode Island.

      Whenever any action shall be brought upon any bond which has a condition of defeasance to make void the bond upon the payment of a less sum at a day or place certain, if the obligor, his or her heirs, executors, or administrators have, before the action brought, paid to the obligee, his or her heirs, executors, or administrators the principal and interest due by the defeasance or condition of the bond, although the payment was not made strictly according to the condition or defeasance, yet it may, nevertheless, be pleaded in defense of the action, and shall be as effectual a bar thereof as if the money had been paid at the day and place, according to the condition or defeasance, and had been so pleaded.

        An equitable defense in an action at law is not admissible under a plea of the general issue but must be set forth by a special plea. Siravo v. Whitman,
        <cite class="ocri">
         51 R.I. 102
        </cite>

        (1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although this section does not permit equitable defenses to be filed to actions at law in the district court a person having an equitable defense to an action in the district could appeal to the superior court and plead his equitable defense in a trial de novo in such court and his failure to do so becomes res judicata and he cannot thereafter obtain equitable relief against such judgment.

      Actions at law, and such other proceedings as the court may order, which have been pending more than ten (10) years on July 10, 1982, may be dismissed for lack of prosecution by the court on its own motion, as directed by the chief justice of the supreme court as to that court, by the presiding justice of the superior court as to that court, and by the respective chief judges of the district and family courts as to those courts. Notice that the dockets are thus to be cleared of inactive cases and the time and place of hearing upon the court’s motion shall be given by the clerk of the court in a public newspaper circulated in the county or district in which the actions are pending by two (2) publications at least one month before the date of hearing. Any attorney, or party not represented by an attorney, may appear at the time of the hearing to be heard on any such dismissals and the court in its discretion may dismiss the case or stay its dismissal for a period to be fixed by the court, and such period may also be extended.

        Where jury commissioners excluded “the president, professors, tutors and students of recognized universities and colleges” such grand jury was composed in violation of constitutional requirements. State v. Jenison,

        Where college students and professors wishing to be exempted from jury duty could obtain such exemption by affirmatively claiming such status, as opposed to there being an automatic exemption from jury duty for such persons, there was no ground for finding a violation of the fair cross-section requirement of U.S. Const., amend. 6, absent a showing that a cognizable class of persons had been excluded from jury service. State v. Bassett,

      Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the jury commissioner may, with approval of the presiding justice of the superior court, select jurors from the registered voters of the several cities and towns as deemed necessary by the jury commission for the several counties of the state by means of the use of electronic data processing equipment, now or hereafter owned or leased by the state of Rhode Island, whenever the secretary of state shall certify to the jury commissioner that the equipment has been furnished with the names of all persons who are registered voters in the cities and towns. In such event, the jury commissioner shall supervise the electronic data processing machine operator in order to carry out the drawing in such a way that neither the jury commissioner nor the operator of the device shall be able to determine any name until the name has actually been drawn. After the drawing has been carried out in accordance herewith, the jury commissioner shall cause the electronic data processing machine operator to have the electronic data processing machine compile a list, by county, randomly mixing the names so drawn. Members of the public and press shall be admitted to the place of electronic data selection, to the extent that space and area may allow.

       The jury commissioner, either personally or by such assistant as he or she may employ as provided in § 9-9-7, shall investigate the names of all persons drawn as provided in § 9-9-14.1, and as far as possible in the order in which the names appear upon the lists. The investigation may be made by the mailing of questionnaires to such persons, or by other written inquiries deemed by the jury commissioner to be appropriate, but where the jury commissioner considers further investigation to be necessary or desirable, the investigation may include a personal interview by the jury commissioner or by one of his or her duly appointed assistants. The jury commissioner shall make lists of all grand and petit jurors for each town not exempted as provided in § 9-9-3, and in the order in which they were originally drawn, as he or she shall deem well qualified to serve, being persons of good moral character, of sound judgment, and free from all exception, which lists shall be kept on file in the office of the jury commissioner. The jury commissioner shall preserve a full record of the investigation, which shall not be disclosed to any person except by order of a justice of the superior court, or by order of the chief judge or associate justice of the family court, and may summon before him or her any person subject to serve as a juror, or any person who in the jury commissioner’s opinion has particular knowledge of a juror’s fitness to serve as a juror, and for this purpose may administer oaths, and have the same powers as are by law provided for the summoning of witnesses by a coroner. Any person so summoned shall be entitled to the same fees as a witness summoned before a coroner. No rejection of a juror by the jury commissioner shall take final effect until it has been approved by a justice of the superior court, appointed for this purpose by the presiding justice, and he or she may appoint different justices from time to time for each county. A justice of the family court who has been appointed by the chief judge for the purpose of considering the recommendations of the jury commissioner concerning the fitness of jurors may also reject jurors. The chief judge may appoint different justices from time to time for each county.

       The jury commissioner shall not place any person upon the list who is not qualified as provided in § 9-9-1.1, nor shall he or she fail to place any person upon the list who is qualified, and if the commissioner or any of his or her assistants shall willfully violate any of the provisions of this section they shall be fined not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000) or be imprisoned for the term of not more than one year, or both.

      From time to time as occasion may require, the superior court or family court shall direct notices to be sent by the clerk thereof to the jury commissioner that there will be required for the county or counties for which the court is held a certain number of grand or petit jurors and the time and place at which they are required to attend. And the jury commissioner, on receiving the notice, shall take from the list of jurors qualified as provided in chapter 9 of this title, in the order in which their names appear on the jury list, so many names as may be required to ensure the attendance of the number of jurors required by the court and shall issue notifications to the city or town sergeant or any certified constable, either in person, or by one of his or her assistants, or by registered or certified mail, and under his or her hand and seal, designating who are grand and petit jurors, and the time and place at which the jurors are required to attend. Upon consent of the town sergeant of the town where any juror resides, the jury commissioner may retain the notifications for service by the jury commissioner or his or her agents.

       <p>
        Since the jurisdiction of the superior court includes geographically the counties of Providence and Bristol and since the jurisdiction of the grand jury is coextensive with that of the court under whose supervision it is impaneled, it is the court’s opinion that with respect to grand jury proceedings the combined counties are a “county” within the meaning of the declarement of common law where all members of the grand jury must be residents of the county for which they are sworn to inquire. Therefore, there is no merit in defendant’s contention that the statute which authorized the Bristol residents to serve on the instant grand jury is unconstitutional. State v. Edwards,

        The term “county” is used to define the territorial limits of the jurisdiction of the grand jury, and since it is merely an appendage of the court for which it is summoned and authorized to inquire, its jurisdiction may be made coextensive with that of the court’s jurisdiction and the territory over which such jurisdiction extends and not necessarily confined to the geographical lines of any county. Therefore, it is clear that the legislature by the enactment of
        <cite class="ocri">
         G.L. 1938
        </cite>
        , ch. 506, § 37, now § 12-11-2, expressly provided that the jurisdiction of the grand jury would be coextensive with that of the court when sitting for those counties. State v. Edwards,

     <p>
      A justice of the superior court or the family court, or the jury commissioner, may excuse a person from jury duty or may continue the date of the service upon a showing of mental or physical disability, illness, or the serious illness of some member of his or her immediate family, economic or domestic hardship, or other good cause; provided, that he or she may be required to serve his or her term or the remainder thereof, as the case may be, on an emergency panel of jurors, if such a panel is deemed necessary by the jury commissioner or the presiding justice of the superior or family court. The discretion to so excuse may be exercised by the appropriate party at any time during the selection or assignment of jurors.

The assigned justice shall order the panel of petit jurors to be divided into two (2) or more subpanels, constituting of not less than twenty-five (25) members each in criminal cases and fifteen (15) members each in civil cases, so that juries may be impaneled from less than the total number summoned in several courtrooms and in civil and criminal cases at the same time; and the assigned justice may thereafter order the consolidation of several subpanels or all of them or may order additions to each of them from other subpanels and may continue, in like manner, as often as he or she shall deem it to be necessary to accomplish the purpose of this section. The subdivision of the panel into subpanels and additions to the subpanels shall be by lot and the names of jurors so drawn by lot shall be placed in a box provided for that purpose.

       Drawing and impaneling of trial jury.

     </h3>
     <p>
      On the day when the petit jurors are summoned to attend at a court in any court for the trial of either civil or criminal cases, the clerk shall cause the name and place of abode of each person summoned as a juror to be written upon a separate paper, all of which papers shall be as nearly as may be of the same size, and shall cause them to be placed in a box provided for that purpose. When a case is brought on to be tried, the clerk in open court shall shake the papers thoroughly and shall then draw out twelve (12) papers in criminal cases or six (6) papers in civil cases, one after the other, or such other number as ordered by the court. If any of the persons whose names are so drawn do not appear, or are excused, or are set aside, the clerk shall draw out other papers until the names of an appropriate number of jurors are drawn who appear and are not excused or set aside. The jurors shall be duly sworn and impaneled, and shall be the jury to try the issue, and one of them shall be appointed foreperson by the court. The names of the jurors so sworn shall be kept by themselves and, when the verdict of the jury has been recorded or when the jury has been discharged by consent of parties or by leave of court, shall be returned to the box; and this process shall be repeated in each case when an issue is brought on to be tried by the jury; but if an issue is so brought on before the verdict in any other case has been recorded or the jury in the case has been discharged, the court may order a jury for the trial of such issue to be impaneled by drawing, in the manner provided, of papers from those then remaining in the box.

       Alternate jurors.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever in the opinion of the court the trial of a civil case before a jury is likely to be a protracted one, the court may, immediately after the jury is impaneled and sworn, direct the calling of one or two (2) additional jurors, to be known as alternate jurors. Alternate jurors shall be drawn from the same source, and in the same manner, and have the same qualifications, as regular jurors, and be subject to examination and challenge as such jurors, except that each party shall be allowed one peremptory challenge for each alternate juror. The alternate jurors shall take the proper oath or affirmation and shall be seated near the regular jurors with equal facilities for seeing and hearing the proceedings in the cause and shall attend at all times upon the trial of the cause in company with the regular jurors. They shall obey all orders and admonitions of the court, and if the regular jurors are ordered to be kept in the custody of an officer during the trial of the cause, the alternate jurors shall also be kept with the other jurors and, except as hereinafter provided, shall be discharged upon the final submission of the cause to the jury. If, before the final submission of the cause, a regular juror dies or is discharged, the court shall order the alternate juror, if there is but one, to take his or her place in the jury box. If there are two (2) alternate jurors, the court shall select one by lot, who shall then take his or her place in the jury box. After an alternate juror is in the jury box he or she shall be subject to the same rules as a regular juror.

      The court shall, on motion of either party in a suit, examine on oath a person who is called as a juror therein, to know whether he or she is related to either party, has any interest in the cause, or has expressed or formed an opinion or is sensible of any bias or prejudice therein; and the party objecting to the juror may introduce any other competent evidence in support of the objection. The court may permit the parties or their attorneys to conduct the examination of the person called as a juror. If it appears to the court that the juror does not stand indifferent in the cause, another shall be called in his or her stead for the trial of that cause, but at no time shall counsel for either party be precluded from examining prospective jurors.

        In considering the pertinent provision of this section providing that the prospective jurors be put under oath for the voir dire examination, obviously the legislature intended to compel them to testify truthfully as to matters which would require their excuse for cause or their removal by peremptory challenge; therefore, such provision relative to the administration of oath to prospective jurors was mandatory when applied for by a party as provided in the act.

      Either party in a civil action may, before the opening of the action or proceeding to the jury, challenge in writing, addressed to the clerk of the court, any qualified jurors called for the trial of the cause or proceeding, not exceeding one in three (3), without alleging or showing any cause therefor; and after the objection the challenged jurors shall not sit in the trial of the cause, but other jurors shall be called to take the place of the challenged jurors for the trial of the cause.

        The consideration of several defendants as one party for the purpose of peremptory challenges in jury selection does not violate the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution because the classification which treats several defendants tried jointly the same as one defendant tried alone was not shown to be either irrational or irrelevant to a legitimate state purpose.

        Defendant could not get new trial on ground that it was impossible for him to receive a fair trial in the county of the murder due to public opinion and juror prejudice where he examined each juror as to prejudice and yet did not use all of his peremptory challenges and where the jurors were not allowed to separate and heard nothing of the case outside the courtroom.

        The requirement that jury trial be demanded before assignment day does not deprive the parties of the right to trial by jury, even though the issues may not have been closed before that time. Mandeville, Brooks &amp; Chaffee v. Fritz,

        The district court has the inherent power at common law to waive the costs of appeal required to be paid by an indigent defendant who appeals a judgment in an action for possession of tenements. However, the court must remain cognizant that the burden is upon the party appealing to prove that he or she is absolutely unable to pay the costs of appeal. Chrysler First Fin. Servs. Corp. v.

        Where the view was granted at the request of the defense and the prisoner did not ask to be permitted to go to the view and made no objection either then or afterwards during the trial because he did not go, the prisoner must be held to have waived his privilege. State v. Congdon,

        In a murder prosecution, the defendant suffered no prejudice as a result of his voluntarily absenting himself from a view of the evidence, in the face of the decision by the state marshals to shackle him during the course of the view. It is certainly proper to require a person accused of a most violent crime to be reasonably restrained by handcuffs and/or shackles in an open area in the presence of jurors and other participants. In any event, the defendant’s presence at the view was not a critical state of the trial, since his participation would have been virtually nonexistent except to have been certain that the jurors were brought to the right place to which the evidence later presented would have appropriately related.

        Although confidential health-care information about a person can be subject to compulsory legal process without first obtaining the person’s consent, health care entities that are subpoenaed to bring the records to a judicial proceeding are not thereby authorized to disclose the records or the information within to any party or person other than the court. In this case, by not complying with the § 9-17-5 governing responses to subpoenas, the pharmacy violated the Confidentiality Act (Chapter 37.3 of Title 5). Washburn v. Rite Aid Corp.,

        Because the pharmacy is not a qualified “health care facility”, it is not entitled to take advantage of the provisions of § 9-19-39 which allows a qualified health care facility to respond to a subpoena for health-care records by certified mail. Washburn v. Rite Aid Corp.,

        A witness has an obligation to appear pursuant to a subpoena and is entitled to be paid a fee. However, a witness’ obligation to appear remains separate from the requirement that a witness be paid, and consequently, nonpayment of a witness fee does not justify a refusal to appear as ordered.

        The fair trial concept requires the trial justice to instruct the jury at the time a prior conviction is received into evidence that it is being admitted for the sole purpose of impeaching credibility and is otherwise without probative value. Mercurio v. Fascitelli,

        If the defendant in a criminal action takes the stand to testify in his own behalf the state may impeach his credibility by showing previous convictions of felonies. State v. McGuire,
        <cite class="ocri">
         15 R.I. 23

        When an accused voluntarily chooses to testify in his own behalf, the prosecution has the right to cross-examine him in respect to such testimony with the same latitude as would be exercised in the case of an ordinary witness regarding the circumstances connecting him with the alleged crime. State v. Wallace,
        <cite class="ocri">
         428 A.2d 1070
        </cite>
        ,

        </cite>
        (R.I. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where prosecution’s cross-examination of the defendant had ceased, but the trial court allowed a reopening of such cross-examination to allow the prosecution to impeach the defendant with prior convictions, this was not tantamount to calling defendant as the state’s witness nor was it an abuse of the trial court’s discretion. State v. Wallace,
        <cite class="ocri">
         428 A.2d 1070
        </cite>

       </p>
       <p>
        As the prosecutor’s questions to defendant during cross-examination about his alleged prior crimes impermissibly introduced false evidence of his criminal conduct and improperly implied he was previously charged with a crime without an evidentiary basis for that suggestion, and the error was not harmless because the questions were significantly prejudicial to defendant, he was entitled to new trial.

        There is no hard and fast rule which requires the trial justice to sustain or overrule an objection to the testimony of a witness who had been convicted of an offense, on the grounds of alleged remoteness of the offense. The better rule is to leave this matter to the sound discretion of the trial justice subject to be reviewed by the Supreme Court only for abuse of such discretion. Pedorella v. Hoffman,
        <cite class="ocri">

        Nothing in the adoption of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence alters the discretion of the trial justice to rule on the admissibility of prior convictions for impeachment purposes. State v. Mattatall,

       <p>
        The trial court did not err in denying a defendant’s motion in limine to preclude the use of the defendant’s prior criminal record for impeachment purposes, because a strong showing of probative value is not necessary to warrant admissibility, only that the probative value substantially outweighs the prejudicial effect. The trial court is endowed with discretion when determining the admissibility of prior convictions in impeaching the credibility of witnesses. State v. Martinez,

        Even illegally obtained evidence may be admitted for impeachment purposes when a defendant gives testimony that may be construed as absolving himself from fault in a criminal case. State v. Dowell,

        A defendant’s bare assertion that he was impermissibly denied counsel or that he could not recall whether he was impermissibly denied counsel at the time he was convicted of prior offenses was not sufficient to prevent the use of the prior convictions for impeachment purposes.

        While it can certainly be said that Rule 609 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence was not intended to replace this section, there can be no question that it places the statute in a new light. However, nothing in the rule suggests or implies that decisions regarding the admissibility of prior convictions for impeachment purposes are no longer discretionary matters for the trial justice to decide. State v. Maxie,

       <p>
        Where the defendant had committed at least four criminal offenses from 1980 through 1995, which the trial justice presumably determined to be sufficient to establish a continuing period of misconduct, it was not an abuse of discretion to rule that the state could use the prior convictions to impeach the defendant, should he take the stand, since those convictions suggested a pattern of criminal activity not wholly unrelated to the case at hand.

        Remoteness is not measured solely by the passage of time; a trial court can take into account convictions intervening between the past conviction and the crime for which the defendant is being tried, since the factfinder has a right to consider whether one who repeatedly refuses to comply with the law is more likely to ignore the obligation of truthfulness than a law-abiding citizen.

        While admission, to impeach a defendant charged with murder, of a 22-year-old conviction for disorderly conduct was error, the court must further determine whether the error was prejudicial, denying a fair trial. State v. Powell,
        <cite class="ocri">
         533 A.2d 530
        </cite>
        ,

        (R.I. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial justice does not abuse his discretion when he does not allow the defendant to impeach a witness through the use of a prior criminal conviction, where the conviction occurred approximately thirteen years prior to the trial, and, except for a single traffic offense, driving without a license, the witness has not been convicted of a crime in the intervening years. State v. Wilson,
        <cite class="ocri">
         568 A.2d 764
        </cite>
        ,

       </p>
       <p>
        Remoteness of a prior conviction is not measured solely by the passage of time. The trial justice must balance the remoteness of the conviction, the nature of the crime, and the defendant’s disdain for the law as represented by the extent of his prior criminal record, to determine whether the relevance with respect to credibility outweighs the prejudicial effect to the defendant. State v. Mattatall,

        A hearing justice erred when she granted an application for postconviction relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel because of counsel’s failure to object, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-17-23, to certain portions of pastors’ testimony. The clergy privilege did not apply to a pastor who was not acting in that capacity; even if counsel was deficient by not raising the privilege with respect to portions of another pastor’s testimony, there was ample evidence sufficient for a jury to convict the applicant.

        Whether or not the presence of third parties destroyed the clergy privilege under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-17-23, in this instance, the confidante was not acting in the capacity of a pastor; any information he received was not properly entrusted to him in the clergy capacity, nor was it necessary and proper to enable him to discharge the functions of his office in the usual course of practice or discipline. The meeting was set up to explore therapy and was not conducted in the confidante’s professional capacity as a pastor of a church; thus, the privilege did not apply to these discussions. Brown v.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In every legal action, both civil and criminal, no health care provider shall be competent to testify concerning any information obtained about a patient, nor shall he or she be required to produce any documentary evidence obtained about a patient, in the course of the customary professional health care relationship, without the consent of the patient, his or her legal guardian, or, if the patient is deceased, his or her next-of-kin, executor, or administrator. No health care provider shall be allowed in giving testimony to disclose any confidential communication or health care information, properly entrusted to him or her in his or her professional capacity and within the customary health care relationship, and necessary and proper to enable him or her to discharge medical duties in the usual course of practice, without the consent of the patient, his or her legal guardian, or, if the patient is deceased, his or her next-of-kin, executor, or administrator. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a health care provider may be required to testify or produce documentary evidence regarding the medical condition of a patient:

      Any person, desirous of perpetuating the testimony of any witness concerning any matter which is or may be the subject of litigation, as well before as after litigation is commenced, may present a petition in writing to any justice of the supreme or superior or family court, or to any justice of a district court, setting forth the reasons of his or her application, the name of the witness or witnesses, the subject matter of the controversy, and the names of all persons known to be interested therein, and praying that the deposition of the witness or witnesses may be taken; and thereupon if the justice be satisfied of the reasonableness of the petition, he or she shall designate some notary public or standing master in chancery to take the deposition, to whom the petition, with the order of designation thereon, shall be sent.

        The plain language of this provision allows for the perpetuation of testimony of witnesses concerning any matter which is or may be the subject of litigation upon a trial justice’s determination concerning the reasonableness of such a petition, but does not permit discovery in any way beyond such testimonial parameters and does not operate as a substitute for discovery.

        The plaintiff’s claim that the statute of limitations was tolled because, through the filing of the petition for the perpetuation of testimony the defendant had knowledge of the possibility of a wrongful-death claim being brought against it, was without merit. There is no provision for any type of constructive notice to a defendant for purposes of tolling an applicable statute of limitations. Benner v. J.H. Lynch &amp; Sons,

        This section does not on its face violate due process or fundamental fairness to respondents by hindering cross-examination because it clearly considers the need to prevent the statute from being too broad-based or all-encompassing. It does not violate equal protection because corresponding concerns of each of the litigants are weighed and balanced by the trial justice in order to prevent manifest unfairness to a particular litigant. This section is also not unconstitutional as applied when the rights and interests of the parties to cross-examination are balanced, and any overriding concerns of a party are considered in order to prevent an unconstitutional application of the statute violating the rights of litigants.

        In a prosecution for sexual assault, the trial justice’s decision to exclude the result of a blood-alcohol analysis of the victim’s blood on the night of the assault is proper, where, if the defendant had wanted the jury to know the results of the blood-alcohol-content test, he could have presented such evidence by introducing the medical record into evidence. Moreover, exclusion of the blood-alcohol content of the victim’s blood was not probative regarding the issue of the defendant’s guilt. State v. Griffin,

        Where a party fails to give the opposing party notice as required by this section, an affidavit he seeks to introduce is inadmissible although it meets all other requirements of this section, and the fact that the party and the court exerted extraordinary efforts to secure the attendance of the affiant as a witness at the trial does not alter such inadmissibility.

        The admission of the medical bills under Rule 803(6), Rules of Evidence, did not circumvent the requirement of this section, that medical affidavits purporting to establish proximate cause be supported by properly documented affidavits or by direct testimony of the physician rendering the opinion.

        Preconditions to the use of the res ipsa doctrine in any negligence action are: (1) the accident or injury must be of a kind which does not occur in the absence of someone’s negligence; (2) such accident or injury must be caused by an agency or instrumentality in the exclusive control of the defendant; and (3) it must not have been caused by any voluntary act or contribution on the part of the plaintiff.

      In the event the defendant so elects, in a legal action based upon a cause of action arising after January 1, 1987, for personal injury against a licensed physician, hospital, clinic, health maintenance organization, professional service corporation providing health care services under chapter 5.1 of title 7, dentist, or dental hygienist based upon professional negligence, the defendant may introduce evidence of any amount payable as a benefit to the plaintiff as a result of the personal injury pursuant to any state income disability or workers’ compensation act, any health, sickness or income disability insurance, accident insurance that provides health benefits or income disability coverage, and any contract or agreement of any group, organization, partnership, or corporation to provide, pay for, or reimburse the cost of medical, hospital, dental, or other health care services. Where the defendant elects to introduce such evidence, the plaintiff may introduce evidence of any amount which the plaintiff has paid or contributed to secure his or her right to any insurance benefits concerning which the defendant has introduced evidence. When such evidence is introduced, the jury shall be instructed to reduce the award for damages by a sum equal to the difference between the total benefits received and the total amount paid to secure the benefits by the plaintiff or the court may ascertain the sum by special interrogatory and reduce the award for damages after verdict. Whenever an award is so reduced, the lien of any first party payor who has paid such a benefit against the judgment shall be foreclosed and the plaintiff shall have no legal obligation to reimburse the payor.

        When Rhode Island law is to be applied in a medical malpractice case brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act, the federal sovereign may avail itself of this section to the same extent as could a hospital or other similarly-situated health-care provider in kindred circumstances.

        Rhode Island’s Medicaid program was not a state income disability act, and thus did not fall within the list of collateral source payments that were admissible to reduce a plaintiff’s damages under R.I. Gen. Laws 1956, 9-19-34.1. Section 9-19-34.1 was not a remedial statute, and the term “income disability act” meant an act that provided income to persons who were disabled; Medicaid did not fit this definition because many Medicaid recipients were not disabled, such as those who were aged 65 or older.

        To qualify as a expert witness, the testifying doctor need not be board certified or otherwise have had training or experience in the same medical specialty as the defendant-physician, provided the proposed expert otherwise has knowledge, skill, experience, or education in the same field as the alleged malpractice. Thus, a doctor skilled in pediatrics and family medicine, with experience in treating animal-bite wounds of the kind suffered by the plaintiff in the case at hand, did not need to be board certified in emergency or internal medicine to testify about the pertinent standard of care in treating such wounds and to opine whether the defendant-physician, who was so certified, met that standard. However relevant such matters may be to the weight given by the factfinder to the expert’s opinion, they should not bar such testimony ab initio. Marshall v. Medical Assocs.,

        There is nothing in the plain and unambiguous language of this section that requires that before an expert testifies in a medical malpractice case, he or she must not only be an expert in the field where the alleged malpractice occurred, but must also practice in the same specialty as the defendant. This additional requirement is unnecessary and is in contravention to the General Assembly’s clear intent. Buja v. Morningstar,

        The “same or similar communities” test is repudiated in favor of a national standard; thus, in an obstetrical malpractice action that involved a procedure and standard of care that has remained constant for over 30 years, a doctor who was board-certified in OB/GYN with over 30 years’ experience, a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at a major New York hospital, and a member of the New York Statewide Professional Standards Review Council was qualified to testify regarding the appropriate standard of care.

        In defining what constitutes the “field” of alleged malpractice, the state supreme court looks largely to the nature of the patient’s injury or to the nature of the procedure employed, rather than to rigid classifications based solely on specialty certification.

        Since it is appropriate in the right circumstances for a proposed expert witness formally trained in a different specialty other than that of the defendant to testify in the context of evaluating the appropriate standard of care in a given case, that same expert may testify regarding causation.

        In determining if expert testimony about novel or technically complex theories or procedures possesses scientific validity, four non-exclusive factors are to be considered: (1) whether the proffered knowledge has been or can be tested; (2) whether the theory or technique has been the subject of peer review and publication; (3) whether there is a known or potential rate of error; and (4) whether the theory or technique has gained general acceptance in the scientific community.

        The court abused its discretion in determining that a patient’s expert doctor was not qualified to testify and render his opinions in the patient’s medical malpractice case where that trial court determined that the expert’s theory of negligence was not one shared by the individual doctor defendants and that the patient failed to introduce any evidence that would corroborate the scientific validity of the doctor’s causation conclusions.

        The trial justice erred when he arbitrarily concluded that a pediatric neurologist could not make a skillful interpretation of obstetrical data and only could speculate on matters related to causation, since the physician’s hands-on experience, coupled with his qualifications as a board-certified pediatrician and especially as a board-certified pediatric neurologist, qualified him to testify about the cause of the infant’s death.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In all cases, except where otherwise provided, if judgment is rendered on default, discontinuance, submission, or motion, damages shall be assessed by the court, with the intervention of a jury unless cause is shown why there should be no intervention of a jury. The claimant in any case may waive the intervention of a jury.

        At common law, the finding of a jury as to damages in defaulted cases was not a verdict but merely an inquest of office which the court could disregard at its discretion, and writ of inquiry of damages in defaulted cases was provided for in Rhode Island by statute of 1647 creating the “General Court of Tryalls.” Dyson v.

         536 A.2d 883

        (R.I. 1988) merely articulates the right to an assessment of damages that a nondefaulting party has against a party against whom judgment has been entered by default pursuant to this section. The holding in Marks does not sweep so broadly as to preclude a nondefaulting codefendant from requesting a jury trial on the issue of damages, even when the other codefendant has defaulted.

        In defaulted action, the question of whether damages as found by jury were excessive was not properly before the court on petition for new trial, where the court had neither approved nor disapproved such finding, as the act of the jury was not sufficient. Dyson v. Rhode Island Co.,

        Comparative negligence does not serve as a bar to a plaintiff’s cause of action, since its net effect is to either to lessen a plaintiff’s recovery or to increase a defendant’s liability. Kay v. Menard,
        <cite class="ocri">
         754 A.2d 760

       </p>
       <p>
        The state comparative negligence statute is not a comparative fault statute, and thus comes into play only after negligence is first established on the part of both the plaintiff and the defendant. Calise v. Hidden Valley Condo. Ass'n,

        The state’s comparative negligence statute does not address proportionate negligence between various defendants, but only permits comparison of either the negligence between a plaintiff and a defendant or, in the case of multiple defendants, the plaintiff and each particular defendant.

        The jury, in a strict-liability action or an implied-warranty action, may consider a plaintiff’s negligent encounter with danger if it decides that the plaintiff’s conduct does not reach that level of culpability that amounts to a knowing encounter with danger, that is, assumption of the risk. The damages should then be reduced by the percent the plaintiff is found to have been negligent. Fiske v. MacGregor,

        It was error for the trial justice to apply the state’s “pure” comparative negligence statute in a case in which the injury and the conduct allegedly causing the injury occurred in Massachusetts, since the defendant’s headquarters and place of business at issue were in that state and the parties might reasonably have expected Massachusetts law to apply.

         Retroactive Application.

       <p>
        The fact that the language of this section was specifically changed from “in any action accruing on and after July 1, 1971, . . .” to “[i]n all actions hereafter brought, . . .” firmly establishes the intent of the legislature that the section apply retroactively. Raymond v. Jenard,
        <cite class="ocri">
         120 R.I. 634
        </cite>
        ,

        (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Two major factors to be weighed in determining the validity of a retroactive statute are the strength of the public interest it serves and the unfairness created by its retroactive operation, and the reliance of the parties on preexisting law is perhaps the most accurate gauge of the latter. Raymond v. Jenard,
        <cite class="ocri">
         120 R.I. 634
        </cite>
        ,

        </cite>
        (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        The test of unfairness as to retroactive application of a statute is not whether formerly impossible recovery is now possible, but whether “settled expectations honestly arrived at with respect to substantial interests” are being defeated. Raymond v. Jenard,
        <cite class="ocri">
         120 R.I. 634

        Abrogation of a defendant’s right to rely on the preexisting rule (of contributory negligence) by retroactive application of this section (providing for comparative negligence) was not inequitable, as the public interest served thereby far outweighs the minimal harshness caused by the retroactive application.

        Although a purchaser at a mortgage foreclosure sale was entitled to notice of a subsequent tax sale because at the time of the tax sale, the controlling statute, former R.I. Gen. Laws § 44-9-11, had not been amended, and the revised statute, R.I. Gen. Laws § 44-9-11, amended by 2002 R.I. Pub. Laws ch. 140, § 1, was not retroactively controlling in the instant appeal, the purchaser was bound by the previous mandates governing foreclosure petitions; R.I. Gen. Laws § 44-9-31 explicitly provided that the failure to raise any question concerning the validity of a tax title on or before the return day would result in the party’s being forever barred from contesting or raising the question in any other proceeding, and therefore the judgment entered upon the tax foreclosure petition was not void, under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-21-2(a)(4). Kildeer Realty v. Brewster Realty Corp.,

        Where a defendant, by reason of physical disability, was unable to appear in court during the eleven months between service upon her of a motion to assign the cause for trial and the rendering of a default judgment and was without counsel during said time, her attorneys having withdrawn their appearance without notice to her and without filing in court her last known address nor affidavit concerning her military service, it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to set the default aside.

        Where a few minutes before the time set for trial, counsel for defendant informed counsel for plaintiff that he no longer represented defendant and, after efforts to contact defendant, plaintiff defaulted defendant, and where defendant showed by affidavit that it had not been notified by its former counsel of the setting of the case for trial and averred facts which, if true, constituted a meritorious defense, it was not an abuse of discretion to set the default aside.

       <p>
        Since the plaintiff’s counsel communicated directly with one of the defendants, who had an attorney, this violation of the anti-contact rule led to excusable neglect by defendants as it caused them to believe the matter was resolved and to thus fail to appear at the hearing on plaintiff’s motion to foreclose their right of redemption; therefore, a default decree in favor of plaintiff was vacated pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-21-2(a). Pleasant Mgmt., LLC v. Carrasco,

        The right to collect post-judgment interest under this section automatically applies to any judgment for damages, even if the actual final amount of the interest cannot be calculated at the time of judgment. Thus, the right to collect post-judgment interest is “included” in judgments for damages. Cardi Corp. v. State,

        Trial justice correctly refused to deny plaintiff interest on the judgment in action of trespass on the case for damages for her alleged delay in bringing case to trial, as this section directing the adding of the interest is neither ambiguous nor equivocal; it speaks imperatively and direct, not to the court but to the clerk who is ordered to add on the interest; this is purely a ministerial act and it contemplates no judicial intervention.

        When the district court employed the federal statutory rate to calculate the prejudment interest in a claim arising under a federal ERISA claim, instead of the flat rate stipulated in this section, the court did not exceed its discretion in choosing the federal rate; as a general rule, federal law governs the scope of remedies available when a claim arises under a federal statute, and this doctrine extends to the rate of prejudgment interest.

        The trial court did not err in denying the insurance company’s motion to vacate the arbitration award because the insurance policy offered no guidance on how to compute prejudgement interest and none of the Rhode Island Supreme Court’s prior decisions on prejudgment interest addressed the uninsured motorist context.

        Trial court did not err in awarding prejudgment interest to a seller because the mere fact that a deposit was involved did not preclude the seller from recovering statutory interest; the case did not involve the return of a deposit but the retention of a deposit as a form of damages, which was the seller’s sole remedial measure under the purchase and sales agreement.

        Prejudgment interest on the plaintiff ’s loss should have been computed at the rate of 12 percent per annum from the date of the claim until the date of the affirmance and revision of the Superior Court’s judgment on appeal. Thereafter, postjudgment interest would accrue on the revised judgment. To do otherwise, i.e., to allow the plaintiff to collect 12 percent interest on the judgment as of the date it was originally entered, would have improperly countenanced a compounding of interest.

        When parties settle without reference to any release given to an earlier settling tortfeasor, prejudgment interest is computed as follows: the later settling defendant is charged with interest on the entire amount of damages from the date on which the plaintiff’s cause of action arose to the date of payment by an earlier settling tortfeasor; the plaintiff’s total damages then are reduced by the amount of the earlier payment and the later settling defendant is charged with interest on the reduced balance of the remaining damages for the period from the date of the earlier payment to the date of entry of judgment; then, the interest charged for both periods is added together and the sum added to the remaining tortfeasor’s post-reduction damages liability.

        Former employee’s motion to amend the judgment on his breach of contract action against several plastics companies to include prejudgment interest was granted where a “date of damages” approach was impractical because it was impossible to discern from the jury’s verdict the precise moment the employee was originally entitled to the damages, the employee’s filing of his lawsuit provided a clear date of demand for performance, such a date reflected the jury’s finding that the employee was entitled to the funds represented in a transition agreement at the time he filed the suit, and as a result, the prejudgment interest provided by R.I.

      The court before which any civil action, whether by appeal or otherwise, is pending may, at any time before final judgment or decree therein, upon motion of any defendant and for cause shown, require a plaintiff who is not an inhabitant of this state to give some sufficient person residing within this state or some surety company authorized to do business therein as surety for costs, which may be done by the surety endorsing his or her name on the complaint with the words “surety for costs,” or by giving bond therefor; and when surety has once been given, may for cause shown, require the plaintiff to give another surety for costs.

        Costs are normally considered the expenses of suing another party, including filing fees and fees to serve process. Fees to pay expert witnesses would not be included in this definition of costs. Moreover, where the trial justice never directly ruled on the plaintiffs’ motion for award of costs, it could be inferred that the justice did not intend to exercise the discretion granted to her by this section and have her award of costs include fees for expert witnesses.

        A party against whom a judgment for costs has been entered with his consent is nevertheless an aggrieved party and may appeal even though the party’s demurrer to a plea in abatement was upheld by the lower court and the judgment on costs awarded before the issues were joined.

        Where defendants in a negligence case, who were found guilty, failed to make cross-claims for contribution against codefendants, who were exonerated, no right of action against codefendants existed under the joint contribution among tortfeasors act, § 10-6-1 et seq., and therefore defendants were not aggrieved parties for purposes of appeal within the meaning of this section as to the judgment in favor of codefendants.

        In a personal injury case, an appeal from the denial of a motion to amend a complaint was not entertained on appeal because it did not fall within one of the statutory exceptions to the final judgment rule; the order did not grant or continue an injunction, appoint a receiver, order the sale of real or personal property, or order or deny a new trial after a jury trial. Moreover, the order did not appear likely to cause consequences that were imminent or that would have caused irreparable damage. Cayer v. Cox R.I. Telecom, LLC,

        (1912), that the court will review a decree which, although in a strict sense interlocutory, has such an element of finality that the court will act before the case has finally terminated in order to prevent the possible injurious consequences, was not applied in divorce proceedings because of the evils that accompany piecemeal review of interlocutory orders entered in the course of those proceedings.

        Ordinarily, the interlocutory nature of an action below, without more, would prevent the Supreme Court from considering an appeal. An exception, judicial in origin, permits a review of a decree which, although in a strict sense interlocutory, has such an element of finality that the court will act before the case has finally terminated in order to prevent possible injurious consequences. Review in the latter situation, however, is by way of a discretionary writ of certiorari. In re Joseph J.,

        Heir’s appeal of a partition order was not reviewable because the order did not fall within the statutory exception permitting appeals from interlocutory orders where it did not terminate the litigation, the parties’ respective interests had not yet been determined, claims remained outstanding, the order authorized the sale of the property, but did not actually order the sale, and the order not only continued a hearing on a motion to sell, but also invited offers to buy the property.

        Since a preliminary injunction issued pursuant to Rule RCP 65 is appealable under this section; because it is appealable, such a preliminary injunction constitutes a judgment under Rule RCP 45, which defines “judgment” to include “any order from which an appeal lies”; and Rule RCP 58 requires that all judgments “be set forth on a separate document,” quite clearly a written preliminary injunction is contemplated by the rules and statutes as controlling over an oral injunctive order for purposes of assessment of conduct which is allegedly contumacious in violation of a preliminary injunction.

        In an action by a chemical company for injunctive and declaratory relief on claims that a former employee violated a noncompetition agreement by consulting with a competing company, remand was ordered of the former employee’s appeal of a superior court order declaring that any work for competing chemical companies violated the agreement. The superior court’s interpretation was in conflict with provisions of the agreement allowing work on some product lines and it needed to determine: (1) whether the former employee’s work with the competing company was explicitly permitted by the noncompetition agreement; (2) whether it was the type of work that was prohibited under the agreement; and (3) whether the agreement was overall unreasonable because it lacked both temporal and geographic limitations.

      In any criminal proceeding, the attorney general shall have the right to object to any finding, ruling, decision, order, or judgment of the superior court or family court, and the attorney general may appeal the findings, rulings, decisions, orders, or judgments to the supreme court at any time before the defendant has been placed in jeopardy; the defendant in any criminal proceeding may also appeal any findings, rulings, decision, order, or judgment of the superior or family court; and the attorney general may appeal thereafter, if, after trial, the defendant appeals. If the attorney general appeals the findings, rulings, decisions, orders, or judgments of the superior or family court before the defendant is placed in jeopardy and the defendant prevails in the supreme court, the attorney for the defendant shall be entitled to a reasonable attorney’s fee and costs, payable by the state, to be set by the supreme court, incurred in representing the defendant in the prosecution of the attorney general’s appeal before the supreme court.

       <p>
        Although this section, in certain circumstances, permits an appeal by the state from an interlocutory ruling, such provision is not available to a defendant for that purpose. State v. Jenison,
        <cite class="ocri">

       <p>
        While the state is permitted, under this section, to appeal a trial court’s decision to dismiss certain counts in an indictment, a defendant cannot cross-appeal from the denial of a motion to dismiss other counts in the indictment. State v. DiPrete,

       <p>
        The state’s appeal from an order granting the defendant’s motion to dismiss does not violate double jeopardy where the agreed statement of facts between the parties stipulated that the facts are only to be considered for a pretrial determination and the defendant specifically reserved the right to a jury trial. State v. Pari,
        <cite class="ocri">
         546 A.2d 175

       <p>
        Trial justice committed clear error by sua sponte dismissing a criminal information against defendant charging her with cruelty to or neglect of a child as defendant did not file a motion to dismiss, and the Family Court failed to follow the procedural rules applicable to dismissals. By prohibiting the Attorney General from fully prosecuting the felony information based on a dismissal in violation of R.I. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 9.1, the trial justice clearly erred and deprived the State of a fair proceeding. State v. Strom,

        Where state appealed adverse ruling in parole revocation hearing by prosecuting a bill of exceptions to the supreme court under this statute, the court was without jurisdiction because one who had been tried and convicted had been placed in jeopardy. State v. Beaulieu,
        <cite class="ocri">

        The appeal of the attorney general was to no avail after the trial justice dismissed the indictment and the defendant had been placed on trial on a valid indictment before a court of competent jurisdiction, had been arraigned, had pleaded, and a jury impaneled and sworn for jeopardy had attached.

An appeal taken pursuant to this section shall proceed in accordance with the rules of appellate procedure of the supreme court.

        The plaintiffs and their constable were under no legal obligation to give advance warning and notice of an execution and levy upon the defendants’ automobile, since their procedure was pursuant to execution-levy of this chapter and not by writ of attachment (chapter 5 of title 10). Had they given advance warning and notice, the automobile would most probably have disappeared from the constable’s view. What was important was that the defendants did in fact, after the levy, receive timely notice of the levy and the intended execution sale. Pezzello Bros. Fruit &amp; Produce Co. v. Armenakes,

        The court refused to apply the one-year limitation applicable to motions pursuant to Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 60(b) to independent actions seeking relief from judgment, since this section gives successful litigants six years in which to seek an execution order and to hold that an independent action brought by the losing party must be brought within one year would be to deprive litigants of the right to challenge judgments for which execution has issued beyond that one year.

        By failing to provide for a preincarceration hearing to determine ability to pay, this section in effect enables only judgment debtors who are able to pay to obtain immediate release from imprisonment and therefore denies equal protection to debtors who are unable to pay.

        Due process requires that a hearing take place after reasonable notice to determine the defendant’s ability to pay the judgment against him prior to the issuance of a body execution. Landrigan v. McElroy,

        At the hearing to determine the debtor’s ability to pay, the defendant has the burden of raising the issue of ability to pay and of demonstrating such an inability by a fair preponderance of the evidence. Landrigan v. McElroy,

      If any person named as the trustee of a defendant, who shall have been charged as trustee by reason of his or her default, shall make affidavit as to whether or not he or she had personal property of the defendant in his or her hands or possession at the time of the service of a writ in the action or suit upon him or her, and stating the amount or articles, if any, so in his or her hands, and that he or she failed to file an affidavit therein before he or she was charged by the court as the trustee of the defendant, either from want of actual notice of the service of the writ, or by accident, mistake, or excusable neglect, and shall give the affidavit to the officer charged with the service of the execution, who shall annex the affidavit to his or her return on the execution, or, if execution has not issued, if the person shall file the affidavit in the court in which he or she has been charged, with the clerk, if there is a clerk, otherwise with the justice thereof, and shall pay to the officer, clerk, or justice, respectively, the money paid for his or her attendance at the time of the service of the writ, and another like sum, and, in case execution has issued, shall pay to the officer the sum stated in his or her affidavit to be so in his or her hands, if any, or so much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy the execution, or, if the property in his or her hand as disclosed by his or her affidavit consists of specific articles, shall then deliver the articles to the officer, no further proceeding shall be commenced against the trustee, except as is provided in § 10-17-14 in case of a false answer or affidavit by the person summoned as trustee, and the officer shall pay the money paid to him or her by the trustee to the plaintiff, or take the specific articles on the execution.

        Where, in a hearing on the garnishee’s motion to vacate the charge against him, the garnishee testified without contradiction that he had informed the officer serving the writ that it was the defendant’s son and not the defendant who worked for him and, upon being so informed, counsel for plaintiff directed the officer to leave the writ nevertheless, that he had never possessed funds or personal estate of the defendant, and that his failure to file a sworn written account as provided in § 10-17-2 was due to the fact that he was under the impression he was not required to do so under such circumstances, the court was warranted in vacating the charge notwithstanding the fact that the garnishee’s mistake was one of law rather than of fact.

        Where debtors in Chapter 7 bankruptcy claimed a boat as an exempt asset under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-26-4(13), which provided an exemption for a “motor vehicle,” the bankruptcy court held that “motor vehicle” as used in R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-26-4(13) referred to vehicles that traveled on land; if the General Assembly intended to include things marine in the exemption statute, it would have said so, rather than being silent on the subject.

       In addition to the property exempt from attachment as set forth in § 9-26-4, an estate of homestead to the extent of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) in the land and buildings, or personal property that the owner uses as a residence, may be acquired pursuant to this section by an owner of a home or an individual who rightfully possesses the premises by lease, as a life tenant, as a beneficiary of a revocable or irrevocable trust or otherwise, and who occupies or intends to occupy the home as his or her principal residence. The estate of homestead provided pursuant to this section shall be automatic by operation of law, and without any requirement or necessity for the filing of a declaration, a statement in a deed, or any other documentation. The estate shall be exempt from the laws of attachment, levy on execution, and sale for payment of debts or legacies, except in the following cases:
       <ol>
        <li id="t09c26s9-26-4.1ol1a1">
         Sale for taxes, sewer liens, water liens, lighting district assessments, and fire district assessments;

        </li>
        <li id="t09c26s9-26-4.1ol1a3">
         For a debt contracted for the purchase of the home;
        </li>
        <li id="t09c26s9-26-4.1ol1a4">
         Upon an order issued by the family court to enforce its judgment that a spouse pay a certain amount weekly or otherwise for the support of a spouse or minor children;

        </li>
        <li id="t09c26s9-26-4.1ol1a7">

      <li id="t09c26s9-26-4.1ol1b">
       For the purposes of this section, “owner of a home” includes a sole owner, lessee (but only a lessee who or that was the owner of a home prior to a transfer to the lessor), joint tenant, tenant by the entirety, or tenant in common; provided, that only one individual may acquire an estate of homestead in the home for the benefit of his or her family; and provided further, that an estate of homestead may be acquired on only one principal residence for the benefit of a family. For the purposes of this section, “family” includes either a parent and child or children, a husband and wife and their children, if any, or a sole owner. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any debt owing to a regulated institution, a debt secured by a mortgage or other voluntary lien on a home, or a mechanics’ lien on the property comprising the estate as provided for under chapter 28 of title 34. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, it shall not be necessary to record a declaration of homestead in order to take advantage of the homestead estate exemption.
      </li>
      <li id="t09c26s9-26-4.1ol1c">
       An estate of homestead shall be subordinate to a mortgage encumbering the home that was signed by all the owners of the home at the time of execution of said mortgage. A mortgage executed by fewer than all of the owners of a home that is subject to an estate of homestead shall be superior only to the homestead estate of the owners who are parties to the mortgage and their non-titled spouses and minor children, if any.
      </li>
      <li id="t09c26s9-26-4.1ol1d">
       For purposes of this chapter, a mortgage shall include an instrument granting a security interest in a manufactured home or cooperative housing unit. The subordination shall not require the signature of a spouse who is not an owner. No statement that a homestead estate shall be subordinate to the mortgage shall be required in the mortgage instrument and nothing contained in a mortgage or any document executed in connection with the mortgage shall affect or be construed to create, modify, or terminate a homestead estate, other than to subordinate it to the mortgage as aforesaid. A mortgage lender shall not require or record a release of homestead in connection with the making and recording of a mortgage.

        When a bankruptcy debtor’s mother generally devised certain real property to the debtor, in common with the debtor’s sister, in the residuary clause of the mother’s will, the debtor could claim a homestead exemption as to the debtor’s interest in the property because a reference to “family” in R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-26-4.1(b) did not bar the debtor from claiming the exemption as (1) the debtor was an “owner of a home” for purposes of the statute, (2) the statute was ambiguous as to the term “family,” and the general assembly did not intend to bar the eligibility of a tenant in common living alone, (3) the statute was intended to benefit tenants in common, and (4) § 9-26-4.1(b) only limited the exemption to one per family.

        Chapter 7 debtor was permitted to avoid 3 judicial liens on property, even though the motions did not comply with a local state bankruptcy rule relating to the avoidance of liens and the calculations did not conform to a federal statute relating to avoidance of liens because, after the bankruptcy court applied correct formula, an exemption impairment amount was greater than liens. The debtor was entitled to an exemption of up to $500,000 in homestead property under state law. In re Derocha,

        A debtor’s bare assertion that he planned to move onto a property upon the death of the life tenant without meeting the burden of establishing such intent or showing the financial ability to do so was insufficient to sustain his burden to prove a claim of homestead exemption under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-26-4.1(a) for his Chapter 7 case. The debtor had not lived within the state where the residence was located for several years and by moving into the residence, his commute to work was increased by two hours per day; further, there was no evidence that the co-owner consented to the debtor’s occupancy or that the co-owner would not force partition and sale.

        Debtor did not qualify for the homestead exemption under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-26-4.1(a) because he did not occupy the property, which was his former marital domicile, there was no evidence that he intended to occupy the property in the future as a primary residence, the fact that his minor daughter occupied the property was not relevant to the validity of the exemption, and Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 188, § 1, which required a writing to create and terminate a homestead exemption, was not similar to R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-26-4.1(a). In re Sacharko,

        A family loses its ability to spend a portion of its income when that income is deferred and placed in a pension. It would be terribly unfair to read an exemption statute, which was created to protect a pension for the benefit of a retired employee’s family, in such a way that the exemption would bar children or a former spouse from receiving support from the very fund created for their benefit, and would once again deny them the benefits of the income they sacrificed to a pension years before.

        The trial master erred by considering the spouse’s disability pension from a city a marital asset and, therefore, erred by awarding the wife 65% of the monthly benefits, as the husband’s firemen’s disability pension was statutorily exempt under this section. Thompson v. Thompson,
        <cite class="ocri">

       <p>
        The provisions of this section cannot operate to preclude a police officer’s pension from being considered a marital asset for purposes of property division upon divorce; the pension is analogous in form to a forced savings account to which the employee and his family deferred compensation for the purpose of their future financial security, and it is therefore considered marital property subject to division along with the employee’s other assets. The same rationale applies with respect to firefighters’ pensions. Duke v. Duke,

        This section did not preclude the court from awarding to wife an interest in the retirement portion of her husband’s disability pension because the antiattachment statute is designed to protect pension funds from creditors and not from the families of employees. Allard v. Allard,

If no such address shall be set forth in the mortgage, attachment, lien, or other encumbrance or if the instrument shall not have been recorded more than thirty (30) days prior to the scheduled sale date, without reference to any adjournment, continuation, or postponement of the sale, no such notice need be mailed to the holder of any such mortgage, attachment, lien, or other encumbrance. If any such notice is so mailed but is undeliverable to the owner or the holder, is refused by the owner or the holder, is unclaimed by the owner or the holder, or if the owner’s or holder’s forwarding notice shall have expired, or if the notice shall otherwise not be delivered by the United States Postal Service, the notice requirement shall be deemed satisfied. If a notice is not given prior to the sale to all persons who have recorded a mortgage, attachment, lien, or any other encumbrance relating to the levied premises, which is junior or subordinate to the execution, the encumbrance shall survive the sale for a period of one year from the date of sale unless a written notice of commencement of foreclosure proceedings of the mortgage or a written notice of intent to enforce the attachment, lien, or other encumbrance is recorded in the land evidence records in the city or town where the levied premises are located. Failure to record written notice within one year of the sale shall render the mortgage, attachment, lien, or other encumbrance, which is junior or subordinate to the execution, unenforceable. If no person redeem the real estate or interest therein before the real estate shall be exposed for sale, which sale shall not be earlier than three (3) months after levy, the officer shall sell the real estate, or so much thereof as shall be sufficient to satisfy the judgment obtained and the costs and charges, at public auction, and a deed thereof, by him or her given, shall vest in the purchaser all the estate, right, and interest which the debtor had therein at the time the estate was attached, or in case there was no attachment, all the estate, right, and interest which the debtor had at the time the levy was made, and the surplus of money that shall arise from the sale of the real estate or interest therein after satisfying the execution and the costs and charges shall be deposited with the general treasurer for the owner thereof, and shall be liable to be attached for his or her other debts.

        A judgment creditor of the estate of decedent’s beneficiary has the identical interest in decedent’s estate as the interest asserted by a judgment creditor who commences an action to reach and apply his judgment debtor’s interest in a decedent’s estate. Lind v. McSoley,

        A trial judge erred when he ruled that the superior court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff’s civil action in the nature of a creditor’s bill seeking to reach and apply the equity of the deceased in property, which action was brought in order to satisfy a judgment awarded her upon which an execution had been returned wholly unsatisfied.

The citation shall be made returnable to the court by which it was issued and shall be served by delivering a copy to the debtor or by leaving a copy at the last and usual place of abode of the debtor with some person living there at least six (6) days before the return day named therein.

        A court clerk, before he issues a citation which would order a judgment debtor to appear before the court to show cause, can examine the execution to see if it has been served in accordance with the legislative (§§ 9-25-7 and 9-25-8) and judicial mandates relating to the service of process.

        When an appellate court reversed a trial court’s denial of judgment debtors’ motion to vacate a default judgment against the debtors and the judgment creditors moved the trial court to enforce the judgment, a trial court had authority to grant the creditors’ motion because R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-28-3, governing enforcement of the judgment, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 69, did not require the debtors’ physical presence in Rhode Island, since the court had personal jurisdiction over the debtors, or limit enforcement of the judgment to assets of the debtors located in Rhode Island.

        Trial court properly entered a judgment in a judgment creditor’s favor because the judgment debtor’s claim was barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel where both parties were also the parties to a previous proceeding that resulted in a final judgment on the merits in the creditor’s favor, and the precise argument that the judgment debtor made in the instant appeal—challenging the trial court’s jurisdiction regarding the lack of a return of an execution—had already been addressed and decided.

If the court entering the decree finds that the debtor is not able at the time to pay the judgment in full or by partial payments, from time to time, it shall enter a finding to that effect which shall be subject to revision on like notice and inquiry and on proof of changed circumstances of the debtor; but no subsequent citation to the debtor shall issue until the creditor or some one in his or her behalf has filed in court an affidavit setting forth evidence of such a change in the circumstances of the debtor as shall satisfy the court that a new inquiry as to the debtor’s ability to pay the judgment shall be made.

     <p>
      If the debtor at any time fails to comply with the decree, the court entering the decree may cause him or her to be cited to show cause for the noncompliance; and unless the debtor shows good cause therefor, the court may order that unless he or she complies with the decree, or with such modification thereof as the court may then make, within the time stated in the order, the failure shall be a contempt of court; and if at the expiration of the time fixed by the court for compliance with the new decree the debtor still fails or refuses to comply therewith, the court may enforce its decree by proceedings for contempt. And if a defendant is in the custody of or committed to jail by a member of the division of sheriffs, or imprisoned, either upon execution or by order of the court in contempt proceedings, it shall not operate in any degree as a payment or satisfaction of the judgment upon which the execution is issued, or concerning which the order is entered, nor shall the custody, commitment to jail, or imprisonment be or constitute any bar, delay, or hindrance to any legal or equitable proceedings to discover or reach any assets, legal or equitable, of the defendant.

       Attorney or unrepresented party must sign papers — Sanctions for frivolous suits.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In any legal action based upon a cause of action arising on or after July 1, 1987, every pleading, motion, and other paper of a party represented by an attorney shall be signed by at least one attorney of record in his or her individual name, whose address and telephone number shall be stated. A party who is not represented by an attorney shall sign his or her pleading, motion, or other paper and state his or her address and telephone number. Except when otherwise specifically provided by rule or statute, pleadings need not be verified or accompanied by affidavit. The signature of an attorney or party constitutes a certificate by him or her that he or she has read the pleading, motion, or other paper; that to the best of his or her knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry it is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, and that it is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation. If a pleading, motion, or other paper is not signed, it shall be stricken unless it is signed promptly after the omission is called to the attention of the pleader or movant. If a pleading, motion, or other paper is signed in violation of this rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, may impose upon the person who signed it, a represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay to the other party or parties the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the pleading, motion, or other paper, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.

        Where no coercive relief was prayed for under the provisions of the act, but the claim for injunctive relief was joined with the demand for declaratory relief, such a joinder is perfectly proper in view of the liberalized provisions for joinder under Rules 18 and 20, R.

        Even where injunctive relief cannot be had under this chapter in the first instance, nevertheless a claim for injunctive relief may be joined with a demand for declaratory relief in light of the liberalized provisions for joinder under Super. Ct. Civ. Rules 18 and 20. Parente v. Southworth,

        It was not necessary for the high court to decide whether an indemnification agreement that required subcontractor to indemnify the general contractor for liability for injuries to the subcontractor’s employee that were caused by the general contractor’s negligence, because there was no evidence the subcontractor had ever entered into an indemnification agreement with the general contractor; therefore, the court properly declared that the subcontractor’s liability insurer had no obligation to indemnify the general contractor.

        When a co-executor of a decedent’s estate, who was also one of the decedent’s sons, sought to use a credit, reflecting his anticipated share from the estate, in order to purchase three parcels of land from the estate, the contested credit provision in the offer document, which referenced the “Estate of Carolyn B. Haffenreffer,” unambiguously referred to the decedent’s overall estate and not just the probate estate because the decedent’s will, which was incorporated by reference into the offer document, employed a pour-over provision, providing for distribution of the probate estate and directing a large portion of the estate be distributed through a trust.

        Because the plaintiff developer’s brought an action for a declaratory judgment on whether zoning ordinances that hindered its ability to develop a parcel of property were validly enacted, the motion judge should have construed the action as one for a declaratory judgment pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-30-1 rather than as an appeal of the enactment of an amendment to a zoning ordinance under R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-24-71(a). Since the question of whether the zoning ordinances violated the notice requirement of R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-24-53 could be the subject of a declaration, the case should have been decided under the declaratory judgment statute and not found to be time barred as effectively an “appeal.” Tucker Estates Charlestown, LLC v.

While in light of the jurisdictional tension in the case involving a retirement board’s decision to place a pensioner on a waiting list to be reinstated within a fire department, it may have been prudent for the trial justice to decline to grant declaratory and injunctive relief rather than struggle with such a narrow path, it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial justice to soldier on in the case.

        In a condominium association’s declaratory judgment action, a trial court properly determined that a condominium unit owner was not permitted to rent his unit to a third tenant because the unambiguous condominium declaration clearly stated that a unit could not be rented more than two times in a single calendar year, the owner held individual, month-to-month tenancies with two tenants and, as such, the owner had reached the maximum number of annual rentals that were allowed under the declaration; thus, the owner’s proposed third lease agreement violated the declaration.

        Since proceeding for a declaratory judgment is neither an action at law nor a suit in equity but a novel statutory proceeding, and since the petition prays for preventive relief by injunction which is obtainable only in equity and since the cause has been concluded below by entry of a final decree as in equity rather than a judgment as at law, a review by appeal is the more appropriate remedy.

        Trial court properly denied an injured party’s petition for a declaratory judgment concerning underinsured motorist coverage; the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, R.I. Gen.

        The trial justice did not err in denying petition of the director of public works of the state, petitioner conceding that he had no political, civil or property right in the freeway’s public facility, there being nothing in the record indicating he had any interest peculiar to himself and distinct from that of the general public, and no private rights of the petitioner were affected by the charging of a fee to the general public for the privilege of parking automobiles upon certain public lands; therefore, in this circumstance, petitioner was not qualified to bring a taxpayer’s suit under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act.

        In a declaratory judgment suit brought by a political party and a gubernatorial campaign against the State Board of Elections seeking to stop the Board from investigating a violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 17-25-10.1, the trial court clearly erred by holding that the Board was required to adopt rules and regulations relevant to its regulatory powers before it could investigate complaints. However, since so much time had passed, and the available remedy was so nominal, the case no longer presented a sufficiently genuine case or controversy to warrant further review. R.I.

        Since prior case law had already determined that public policy concerns did not preclude enforcement of a Massachusetts auto insurance policy limiting liability coverage to accidents that occurred in Massachusetts, a trial court should have granted an auto insurer’s motion for summary judgment declaring that the insurer did not have to provide coverage for an accident that occurred in Rhode Island; Rhode Island’s own compulsory coverage provisions applied only to cars registered in Rhode Island.

        Hearing justice erred in dismissing the former employer’s declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that a release by the employee arising out of the settlement of a workers’ compensation claim released the employer from the employee’s claims before the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights for disability discrimination.

        Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, § 9-30-1 et seq., clearly allows the holder of a release document to seek from the superior court a declaration as to the validity and enforceability of the release; prompt and definitive resolution of release-related issues is one of the many salutary efficiencies made possible by the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act.

        Election of remedies doctrine was inapplicable because it mattered not that a former employer opted not to have the discrimination case removed to superior court under § 28-5-24.1 as the employer did not commence the litigation before the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights and thus did not affirmatively elect any remedy; consequently, the employer was entitled to have the question of the validity and enforceability of the contractual settlement agreement passed upon by the courts. Family Dollar Stores of R.I., Inc. v. Araujo,

        Doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies was inapplicable because the case did not involve a situation where a party was aggrieved by a decision of an agency and must exhaust all avenues of review within that agency before proceeding to court, but rather, the case involved a purely contractual issue. The validity and applicability of a release is a legal question, unquestionably within the jurisdiction and purview of the superior court. Family Dollar Stores of R.I., Inc. v. Araujo,

        Where nothing in the record indicated that the terms and conditions of an insurance policy were unclear, unreasonable or unconscionable, and the issue of liability under the policy thus should have been decided on the basis of the terms of the policy and the complaint, the trial justice abused his discretion in denying the application for a declaratory judgment when he improperly considered questions of agency and notice which were not contained in the complaint.

        In a declaratory judgment action, a failure to join indispensable parties was fatal; unit owners who received the benefit of a condominium association’s assessment for deck repairs, but who bore the financial burden of the reallocated costs as set forth in the judgment, should have been joined in the lawsuit. The unit owners who were not joined could sue to avoid paying the reassessments ordered by the judgment, and this was antithetical to the purpose of declaratory judgment actions. Burns v.

        Since proceeding for a declaratory judgment is neither an action at law nor a suit in equity but a novel statutory proceeding, and since the petition prays for preventive relief by injunction which is obtainable only in equity and since the cause has been concluded below by entry of a final decree as in equity rather than a judgment as at law, a review by appeal is the more appropriate remedy.

        Fact that the non-diverse architect and engineer were named pursuant to the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-30-1 et seq., in a builder’s action against a diverse owner concerning a construction contract did not relieve the builder of the obligation to allege sufficient facts supporting the claim that the architect and engineer had a legal interest in the proceeding; therefore, because the builder’s complaint stated no cause of action against them and the architect testified that he was joined so the case could not be heard in state court, the architect and builder were fraudulently joined to defeat diversity jurisdiction.

        Where landowners failed to join all the parties to the consent agreement as required under R.I. Gen.

        In a declaratory judgment action, a failure to join indispensable parties was fatal; unit owners who received the benefit of a condominium association’s assessment for deck repairs, but who bore the financial burden of the reallocated costs as set forth in the judgment, should have been joined in the lawsuit. The unit owners who were not joined could sue to avoid paying the reassessments ordered by the judgment, and this was antithetical to the purpose of declaratory judgment actions. Burns v.

        In fire district’s suit for a declaratory judgment that the district did not have to provide fire protection to a certain property, the fire district did not fail to join an indispensable party by not joining another fire district; the first district was contractually obligated to assume the second district’s responsibilities, so the first district was the proper party to seek clarification of those responsibilities. Moreover, the property owner failed to advance a meaningful appellate argument concerning the issue. Dunn's Corners Fire Dist. v. Westerly Ambulance Corps,

        Failure to serve the attorney general in a declaratory-judgment action warranted dismissal of the action, even though the plaintiff complied with Sup. Ct. Rule 32 and the attorney general was shown to have declined an opportunity to brief the constitutional issues. Brown v. Samiagio,

        Although rules relating to service of process must be followed and construed strictly, where an appearance by the assistant attorney general was made within the period that an answer was due in response to the plaintiffs’ complaint alleging the unconstitutionality of a statute, the procedural objectives of this section were effectuated.

        Trial justice’s denial of a motion to amend pleadings to include a defense that certain statutes are unconstitutional is not an abuse of discretion, where there is no indication that proper service was made upon the attorney general, as required by this section. Crossman v. Erickson,

        The statute does not require that the attorney general be made a party to the action; it only requires that the attorney general “be served with a copy of the proceeding and be entitled to be heard.” The language indicates a legislative intention only to require that the attorney general be given notice of the proceedings and an opportunity to be heard on behalf of the state of Rhode Island. Under the statute the attorney general’s office has the option to intervene in an action, but in its discretion it may choose not to exercise this option. Snicker's, Inc. v. Young,

        Defendant waived the claim that the magistrate in his probation violation case was not statutorily authorized to preside over the probation revocation hearing because the statutory authorization was not constitutional, as defendant did not raise the issue in the trial court and the issue was not novel. Further, defendant could not raise that issue on appeal because defendant did not serve the Attorney General with a copy of the proceeding if defendant intended to challenge the constitutionality of a statute, as was required by R.I.

        Private citizens, even attorneys, did not have standing to seek declaratory relief by means of what was essentially a proceeding in quo warranto, challenging the right of Rhode Island’s chief justice to continue in office after accepting an appointment to a federal military review panel; only the attorney general could pursue such relief, and whether that officer should pursue it was not something that a court could compel.

         Duty of Care.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        When the government or its agent engages in an activity normally undertaken by private individuals in the course of their everyday lives, a duty arises under the common law to exercise reasonable care in the performance of this task. Governmental employees, like ordinary citizens, must operate their vehicles in a reasonably safe manner and avoid creating foreseeably unreasonable risks of harm to the motoring public. Catone v. Medberry,
        <cite class="ocri">
         555 A.2d 328
        </cite>
        ,
        <cite class="ocri">
         1989 R.I. LEXIS 34
        </cite>
        (R.I. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        The state, as landowner or park operator, acts as a private person might act who is the owner of land and who charges a fee to those who might come upon that land. That duty in accordance with recognized tort principles would be to maintain the property in a reasonably safe condition for the benefit of those persons who might come upon the land. O'Brien v. State,
        <cite class="ocri">
         555 A.2d 334
        </cite>
        ,
        <cite class="ocri">
         1989 R.I. LEXIS 35
        </cite>
        (R.I. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the activity the state was engaged in was one that a private individual typically performs, the state owes the public a duty of reasonable care and will be liable for a breach of that duty to the same extent a private individual would be in the same circumstances. Longtin v. D'Ambra Constr. Co.,
        <cite class="ocri">
         588 A.2d 1044
        </cite>
        ,
        <cite class="ocri">

        </cite>
        (R.I. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the state engages in an activity that a private individual typically would not perform, such as the maintenance of state highways or the issuance of state drivers’ licenses, the public duty doctrine will shield the state from liability. Longtin v. D'Ambra Constr. Co.,

         — “Egregious Conduct” Exception.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Under the “egregious conduct” exception to the public duty doctrine, the state is not immune from liability even though no special duty to the plaintiff in his or her individual capacity has been shown. The elements that must be established to find that a particular course of conduct is “egregious” are the following: (1) the state, in undertaking a discretionary action or in maintaining or failing to maintain the product of a discretionary action, creates circumstances that forced a reasonably prudent person into a position of extreme peril; (2) the state, through its employees or agents capable of abating the danger, had actual or constructive knowledge of the perilous circumstances; and (3) the state, having been afforded a reasonable amount of time to eliminate the dangerous condition, failed to do so.

       <p>
        Aside from the special duty exception, a second exception to the public duty doctrine’s general tort immunity is the egregious conduct exception. This exception provides that when the state or its subdivision has knowledge that it has created a circumstance that forces an individual into a position of peril and subsequently chooses not to remedy the situation, the state or its subdivision can then be held liable for its negligence.

        The special duty doctrine, an exception to the public duty doctrine, will subject the state to liability despite the fact that the activity engaged in by the state was one that a private individual typically would not perform. In order for plaintiffs to come within the special duty doctrine, plaintiffs must show a breach of some duty owed them in their individual capacities and not merely a breach of some obligation owed the general public.

        The state may be liable when it performs a discretionary governmental action if the plaintiff can show that she comes within the “special duty” exception to the public duty doctrine. To satisfy the burden of qualifying for such an exception the plaintiff must demonstrate a breach of a duty owed by the state to the plaintiff in his or her individual capacity and “not merely a breach of some obligation owed the general public.” Haley v. Lincoln,

        The public duty doctrine shields the state and its political subdivisions from tort liability arising out of discretionary governmental actions that are not ordinarily performed by private persons; however, notwithstanding that immunity, liability will attach if it can be determined in a particular setting that the state or its subdivision owed a special duty to the plaintiff. The existence of the special duty can be established when a plaintiff has had prior contact with state or municipal officials who then knowingly embark on a course of conduct that endangers the plaintiff, or when a plaintiff has otherwise specifically come within the knowledge of the officials so that the injury to that particularly identified plaintiff can be or should have been foreseen.

        Plaintiffs, parents of children who were abused while in foster care, argued that a district court should have found that the “special duty” exception to immunity under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-31-1 was applicable given the conclusions in its substantive due process analysis that defendant social worker and her supervisor had a “special relationship” with plaintiffs and that plaintiffs’ evidence sufficed to show negligence. The argument ignored the district court’s finding that there was no evidence presented to show that defendants had any actual knowledge of a substantial risk of harm, plaintiffs did not present evidence showing that defendants could have reasonably foreseen that either of the adult males living in the foster home were likely to abuse the children, and the failure to present such evidence meant that plaintiffs could not satisfy the third prong of the special exception test and defendants remained entitled to immunity for the negligence claims brought against them in their official capacities.

        When a worker injured in a construction project sued a town for his injuries because it erroneously issued a building permit for the project without obtaining the contractor’s registration number, as required by R.I. Gen. Laws § 5-65-3(c), the town was entitled to summary judgment because: (1) the issuance of building permits was immune under the public duty doctrine, despite the general waiver of sovereign immunity in R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-31-1, as no private entity could do it; (2) the special duty exception to the public duty doctrine did not apply to the worker, as the building inspector who issued the building permit was not specifically aware of the worker, and R.I. Gen. Laws § 5-65-3(c) did not create a special duty to those in the worker’s position, because the statute’s duty was owed to the general public; and (3) the egregious conduct exception to the public duty doctrine did not apply because the inspector who issued the permit did not know it was issued to an unlicensed contractor, nor did the inspector know an unlicensed contractor was actually building this particular project.

        Summary judgment for a department in a case alleging distribution of contaminated food was improper because the government function at issue—the storage and distribution of food—was an activity that private persons and businesses performed regularly, so the public duty doctrine did not apply, and the department was not shielded from liability under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-31-1. Adams v. R.I. Dep't of Corr.,

        City was entitled to summary judgment in a driver’s suit claiming that dangerous traffic conditions at an intersection led to a traffic accident because the city’s placement of traffic-control devices was a discretionary governmental activity shielded from R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-31-1 liability under the public-duty doctrine; although the driver claimed that the public-duty doctrine did not apply in light of the guideline of R.I. Gen. Laws § 31-13-3, the driver failed to cite any particular state mandate with which the city allegedly did not comply. Toegemann v. City of Providence,

        Property owner’s federal takings claim against state agencies and state officials was unripe because the property owner did not show that a cause of action for inverse condemnation under Rhode Island law was unavailable or inadequate to compensate for takings. Even if the damages cap in R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-31-2 applied and compromised the adequacy of the state law inverse condemnation claim, the property owner’s takings claim would not be deemed ripe until the property owner pursued damages above the $ 100,000 limit.

        The determination of whether the State had to defend and indemnify a state trooper who pled nolo contendere to assault of an arrestee was not an arbitrable issue within the collective bargaining process. Whether a state employee was acting within the scope of his or her employment, and is therefore entitled to a defense provided by the State, is a question that in the first instance is textually committed to the Attorney General under §§ 9-31-8 and 9-31-9.

        Utah order denying a nonresident shareholder’s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction was not entitled to full faith and credit in Rhode Island because the issue of personal jurisdiction as to the shareholder was not fully and fairly litigated and then finally decided in Utah. Neither the shareholder, nor counsel for the shareholder, appeared at a hearing in Utah on the shareholder’s motion to dismiss, and the Utah court’s order contained no discussion, analysis, or legal reasoning and merely referenced that plaintiff had made a prima facie showing of sufficient facts to establish personal jurisdiction.

       A monetary claim is neither usurious nor unconscionable because the agreement on which it is based provides that the amount of the debtor’s obligation to be paid in the debtor’s money, when received by the creditor, must equal a specified amount of the foreign money of the country of the creditor. If, because of unexcused delay in payment of a judgment or award, the amount received by the creditor does not equal the amount of the foreign money specified in the agreement, the court or arbitrator shall amend the judgment or award accordingly.

       A party’s exercise of his or her right of petition or of free speech under the United States or Rhode Island constitutions in connection with a matter of public concern shall be conditionally immune from civil claims, counterclaims, or cross-claims. Such immunity will apply as a bar to any civil claim, counterclaim, or cross-claim directed at petition or free speech as defined in subsection (e) of this section, except if the petition or free speech constitutes a sham. The petition or free speech constitutes a sham only if it is not genuinely aimed at procuring favorable government action, result, or outcome, regardless of ultimate motive or purpose. The petition or free speech will be deemed to constitute a sham as defined in the previous sentence only if it is both:

       The court shall stay all discovery proceedings in the action upon the filing of a motion asserting the immunity established by this section; provided, however, that the court, on motion and after a hearing and for good cause shown, may order that specified discovery be conducted. The stay of discovery shall remain in effect until notice of entry of the order ruling on the motion.

The court shall award compensatory damages and may award punitive damages upon a showing by the prevailing party that the responding party’s claims, counterclaims, or cross-claims were frivolous or were brought with an intent to harass the party or otherwise inhibit the party’s exercise of its right to petition or free speech under the United States or Rhode Island constitution.

        Anti-SLAPP (strategic litigation against public participation) statute, R.I. Gen. Laws 9-33, cannot reasonably be read as providing a mechanism by which a party may file a separate “SLAPP-back” lawsuit. Rather, the statute provides that, in the same civil action in which a party has successfully invoked the conditional immunity granted by the anti-SLAPP statute, the court in that case shall award compensatory damages and may award punitive damages pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-33-2; there is no suggestion in the statute that there should subsequently be a separate civil action. Palazzo v. Alves,

        By electing to file a motion to dismiss in a first action against them for defamation by asserting conditional immunity under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-33-2 the defendants lost any inchoate right to file a subsequent malicious prosecution action. The General Assembly obviated the need for a successful SLAPP litigant to file a subsequent lawsuit to recover damages by providing for the recovery of compensatory and punitive damages, as well as costs and attorneys’ fees, within the ambit of the anti-SLAPP suit itself.

        Although a neighbor who prevailed under the anti-SLAPP (Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation) statute, R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-33-2, in a landowner’s abuse of process claim was entitled to attorneys’ fees under the statute, the motion justice did not abuse her discretion in finding the neighbor’s attorneys’ fees should not have included fees incurred in an unsuccessful summary judgment motion and unsuccessful petition for a writ of certiorari.

        Defendants prevailed under the limits on strategic litigation against public participation (anti-SLAPP) statute, and thus an award of attorney’s fees under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-33-2(d) in defendants’ favor was mandatory. Sisto v. Am. Condo. Ass'n,

        While the mandate made no mention of attorney’s fees in connection with the appeal, this did not preclude the superior court from subsequently awarding defendants attorney’s fees incurred in defending the judgment on appeal; fees were mandatory under the statute and thus the mandate left the determination of the proper award of fees to the superior court.

        Hearing justice did not abuse his discretion in awarding attorney’s fees to defendants in connection with their appeal, as he reduced defendants’ request by 75% to more accurately reflect the time spent on the tangentially related claim under the limits on strategic litigation against public participation (anti-SLAPP) statute, and the billing records were not a diligent accounting for the time spent on the anti-SLAPP appeal; furthermore, the hearing justice then increased the reduced fee by 5% based on the complexity of the anti-SLAPP claim, and no abuse of discretion was found.

        In a landowner’s abuse of process claim against a neighbor, the neighbor’s appeal to a zoning board was not a sham and warranted immunity under the anti-SLAPP (Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation) statute, R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-33-2(a)(2), because the neighbor’s appeal was not subjectively baseless; the neighbor testified the purpose of the zoning appeal was to prevent the landowner from using a building on his property as a culinary school and the landowner failed to offer evidence the neighbor sought the zoning appeal for its direct effect and not for its outcome.

       <li id="t09c34s9-34-2-officialcommentol11">
        The defined terms “foreign state” and “foreign judgment” in the 1962 Act have been changed to “foreign country” and “foreign-country judgment” in order to make it clear that the Act does not apply to recognition of sister-state judgments. Some courts have noted that the “foreign state” and “foreign judgment” definitions of the 1962 Act have caused confusion as to whether the Act should apply to sister-state judgments because “foreign state” and “foreign judgment” are terms of art generally used in connection with recognition and enforcement of sister-state judgments.  See, e.g.,Eagle Leasing v. Amandus, 476 N.W.2d 35 (S. Ct. Iowa 1991) (reversing lower court’s application of UFMJRA to a sister-state judgment, but noting lower court’s confusion was understandable as “foreign judgment” is term of art normally applied to sister-state judgments).  See also, Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act § 1 (defining “foreign judgment” as the judgment of a sister state or federal court).
        <p id="t09c34s9-34-2-officialcommentol11.1">
         The 1962 Act defines a “foreign state” as “any governmental unit other than the United States, or any state, district, commonwealth, territory, insular possession thereof, or the Panama Canal Zone, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, or the Ryuku Islands.” Rather than simply updating the list in the 1962 Act’s definition of “foreign state,” the new definition of “foreign country” in this Act combines the “listing” approach of the 1962 Act’s “foreign state” definition with a provision that defines “foreign country” in terms of whether the judgments of the particular government’s courts are initially subject to the Full Faith and Credit Clause standards for determining whether those judgments will be recognized. Under this new definition, a governmental unit is a “foreign country” if it is (1) not the United States or a state, district, commonwealth, territory or insular possession of the United States; and (2) its judgments are not initially subject to Full Faith and Credit Clause standards.
        </p>
        <p id="t09c34s9-34-2-officialcommentol11.2">
         The Full Faith and Credit Clause, Art. IV, section 1, provides that “Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records, and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof.” Whether the judgments of a governmental unit are subject to the Full Faith and Credit Clause may be determined by judicial interpretation of the Full Faith and Credit Clause or by statute, or by a combination of these two sources. For example, pursuant to the authority granted by the second sentence of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, Congress has passed
         <cite class="ocri">
          28 U.S.C.
         </cite>
         A. § 1738, which provides
         <i>
          inter alia
         </i>
         that court records from “any State, Territory, or Possession of the United States” are entitled to full faith and credit under the
         Full Faith and Credit Clause. In
         <i>
          Stoll v. Gottlieb
         </i>
         ,
         <cite class="ocri">
          305 U.S. 165
         </cite>
         , 170 (1938), the United States Supreme Court held that this statute also requires that full faith and credit be given to judgments of federal courts. States also have made determinations as to whether certain types of judgments are subject to the
         Full Faith and Credit Clause.
         <i>
          E.g.
         </i>
         Day v. Montana Dept. Of Social &amp; Rehab. Servs., 900 P.2d 296 (Mont. 1995) (tribal court judgment not subject to Full Faith and Credit, and should be treated with same deference shown foreign-country judgments). Under the definition of “foreign country” in this Act, the determination as to whether a governmental unit’s judgments are subject to full faith and credit standards should be made by reference to any relevant law, whether statutory or decisional, that is applicable “in this state.”
        </p>
        <p id="t09c34s9-34-2-officialcommentol11.3">
         The definition of “foreign country” in terms of those judgments not subject to Full Faith and Credit standards also has the advantage of more effectively coordinating the Act with the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act. That Act, which establishes a registration procedure for the enforcement of sister state and equivalent judgments, defines a “foreign judgment” as “any judgment, decree, or order of a court of the United States or of any other court which is entitled to full faith and credit in this state.” Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act, § 1 (1964). By defining “foreign country” in the Recognition Act in terms of those judgments not subject to full faith and credit standards, this Act makes it clear that the Enforcement Act and the Recognition Act are mutually exclusive – if a foreign money judgment is subject to full faith and credit standards, then the Enforcement Act’s registration procedure is available with regard to its enforcement; if the foreign money judgment is not subject to full faith and credit standards, then the foreign money judgment may not be enforced until recognition of it has been obtained in accordance with the provisions of the Recognition Act.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li id="t09c34s9-34-2-officialcommentol12">
        The definition of “foreign-country judgment” in this Act differs significantly from the 1962 Act’s definition of “foreign judgment.” The 1962 Act’s definition served in large part as a scope provision for the Act. The part of the definition defining the scope of the Act has been moved to section 3, which is the scope section.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c34s9-34-2-officialcommentol13">
        The definition of “foreign-country judgment” in this Act refers to “a judgment” of “a court” of the foreign country. The foreign-country judgment need not take a particular form – any order or decree that meets the requirements of this section and comes within the scope of the Act under Section 3 is subject to the Act. Similarly, any competent government tribunal that issues such a “judgment” comes within the term “court” for purposes of this Act. The judgment, however, must be a judgment of an adjudicative body of the foreign country, and not the result of an alternative dispute mechanism chosen by the parties. Thus, foreign arbitral awards and agreements to arbitrate are not covered by this Act. They are governed instead by federal law, Chapter 2 of the U.S. Arbitration Act,
        <cite class="ocri">
         9 U.S.C.
        </cite>
        §§ 201- 208, implementing the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards and Chapter 3 of the U.S. Arbitration Act,
        <cite class="ocri">
         9 U.S.C.
        </cite>
        §§ 301- 307, implementing the Inter-American Convention on International Commercial Arbitration. A judgment of a foreign court confirming or setting aside an arbitral award, however, would be covered by this Act.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c34s9-34-2-officialcommentol14">
        The definition of “foreign-country judgment” does not limit foreign-country judgments to those rendered in litigation between private parties. Judgments in which a governmental entity is a party also are included, and are subject to this Act if they meet the requirements of this section and are within the scope of the Act under Section 3.

       Source: This section is based on Section 2 of the 1962 Act. Subsection (b) contains material that was included as part of the definition of “foreign judgment” in Section 1(2) of the 1962 Act. Subsection (c) is new.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li id="t09c34s9-34-3-officialcommentol11">
        Like the 1962 Act, this Act sets out in subsection 3(a) two basic requirements that a foreign-country judgment must meet before it comes within the scope of this Act – the foreign-country judgment must (1) grant or deny recovery of a sum of money and (2) be final, conclusive and enforceable under the law of the foreign country where it was rendered. Subsection 3(b) then sets out three types of foreign-country judgments that are excluded from the coverage of this Act, even though they meet the criteria of subsection 3(a) – judgments for taxes, judgments constituting fines and other penalties, and judgments in domestic relations matters. These exclusions are comparable to those contained in Section 1(2) of the 1962 Act.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c34s9-34-3-officialcommentol12">
        This Act applies to a foreign-country judgment only to the extent the foreign-country judgment grants or denies recovery of a sum of money. If a foreign-country judgment both grants or denies recovery of a sum money and provides for some other form of relief, this Act would apply to the portion of the judgment that grants or denies monetary relief, but not to the portion that provides for some other form of relief. The U.S. court, however, would be left free to decide to recognize and enforce the non-monetary portion of the judgment under principles of comity or other applicable law. See Section 11.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c34s9-34-3-officialcommentol13">
        In order to come within the scope of this Act, a foreign-country judgment must be final, conclusive, and enforceable under the law of the foreign country in which it was rendered. This requirement contains three distinct, although inter-related concepts. A judgment is final when it is not subject to additional proceedings in the rendering court other than execution. A judgment is conclusive when it is given effect between the parties as a determination of their legal rights and obligations. A judgment is enforceable when the legal procedures of the state to ensure that the judgment debtor complies with the judgment are available to the judgment creditor to assist in collection of the judgment.
        <p id="t09c34s9-34-3-officialcommentol13.1">
         While the first two of these requirements – finality and conclusiveness – will apply with regard to every foreign-country money judgment, the requirement of enforceability is only relevant when the judgment is one granting recovery of a sum of money. A judgment denying a sum of money obviously is not subject to enforcement procedures, as there is no monetary award to enforce. This Act, however, covers both judgments granting and those denying recovery of a sum of money. Thus, the fact that a foreign-country judgment denying recovery of a sum of money is not enforceable does not mean that such judgments are not within the scope of the Act. Instead, the requirement that the judgment be enforceable should be read to mean that, if the foreign-country judgment grants recovery of a sum of money, it must be enforceable in the foreign country in order to be within the scope of the Act.
        </p>
        <p id="t09c34s9-34-3-officialcommentol13.2">
         Like the 1962 Act, subsection 3(b) requires that the determinations as to finality, conclusiveness and enforceability be made using the law of the foreign country in which the judgment was rendered. Unless the foreign-country judgment is final, conclusive, and (to the extent it grants recovery of a sum of money) enforceable in the foreign country where it was rendered, it will not be within the scope of this Act.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li id="t09c34s9-34-3-officialcommentol14">
        Subsection 3(b) follows the 1962 Act by excluding three categories of foreign-country money judgments from the scope of the Act – judgments for taxes, judgments that constitute fines and penalties, and judgments in domestic relations matters. The domestic relations exclusion has been redrafted to make it clear that all judgments in domestic relations matters are excluded from the Act, not just judgments “for support” as provided in the 1962 Act. This is consistent with interpretation of the 1962 Act by the courts, which extended the “support” exclusion in the 1962 Act beyond its literal wording to exclude other money judgments in connection with domestic matters.  E.g., Wolff v. Wolff,
        <cite class="ocri">
         389 A.2d 413
        </cite>
        (My. App. 1978) (“support” includes alimony).
        <p id="t09c34s9-34-3-officialcommentol14.1">
         Recognition and enforcement of domestic relations judgments traditionally has been treated differently from recognition and enforcement of other judgments. The considerations with regard to those judgments, particularly with regard to jurisdiction and finality, differ from those with regard to other money judgments. Further, national laws with regard to domestic relations vary widely, and recognition and enforcement of such judgments thus is more appropriately handled through comity than through use of this uniform Act. Finally, other statutes, such as the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act and the federal International Child Support Enforcement Act,
         <cite class="ocri">
          42 U.S.C.
         </cite>
         § 659a (1996), address various aspects of the recognition and enforcement of domestic relations awards. Under Section 11 of this Act, courts are free to recognize money judgments in domestic relations matters under principles of comity or otherwise, and U.S. courts routinely enforce money judgments in domestic relations matters under comity principles.

        <p id="t09c34s9-34-3-officialcommentol14.2">
         Foreign-country judgments for taxes and judgments that constitute fines or penalties traditionally have not been recognized and enforced in U.S. courts.
         <i>
          See, e.g.
         </i>
         ,
         Restatement Third of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States § 483 (1986). Both the “revenue rule,” under which the courts of one country will not enforce the revenue laws of another country, and the prohibition on enforcement of penal judgments seem to be grounded in the idea that one country does not enforce the public laws of another.

         </i>
         . Reporters’ Note 2. The exclusion of tax judgments and judgments constituting fines or penalties from the scope of the Act reflects this tradition. Under Section 11, however, courts remain free to consider whether such judgments should be recognized and enforced under comity or other principles.

        <p id="t09c34s9-34-3-officialcommentol14.3">
         A judgment for taxes is a judgment in favor of a foreign country or one of its subdivisions based on a claim for an assessment of a tax. Thus, a judgment awarding a plaintiff restitution of the purchase price paid for an item would not be considered in any part a judgment for taxes, even though one element of the recovery was the sales tax paid by the plaintiff at the time of purchase. Such a judgment would not be one designed to enforce the revenue laws of the foreign country, but rather one designed to compensate the plaintiff. Courts generally hold that the test for whether a judgment is a fine or penalty is determined by whether its purpose is remedial in nature, with its benefits accruing to private individuals, or it is penal in nature, punishing an offense against public justice.
         <i>
          E.g.
         </i>
         , Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. v. Hoffman, 665 F.Supp 73 (D. Mass. 1987) (finding that Belgium judgment was not penal even though the proceeding forming the basis of the suit was primarily criminal where Belgium court considered damage petition a civil remedy, the judgment did not constitute punishment for an offense against public justice of Belgium, and benefit of the judgment accrued to private judgment creditor, not Belgium). Thus, a judgment that awards compensation or restitution for the benefit of private individuals should not automatically be considered penal in nature and therefore outside the scope of the Act simply because the action is brought on behalf of the private individuals by a government entity.

          Cf.
         </i>
         U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement, art.14.7.2, U.S.-Austl., May 18, 2004 (providing that when government agency obtains a civil monetary judgment for purpose of providing restitution to consumers, investors, or customers who suffered economic harm due to fraud, judgment generally should not be denied recognition and enforcement on ground that it is penal or revenue in nature, or based on other foreign public law).

        Under subsection 3(b), a foreign-country money judgment is not within the scope of this Act “to the extent” that it comes within one of the excluded categories. Therefore, if a foreign-country money judgment is only partially within one of the excluded categories, the non-excluded portion will be subject to this Act.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c34s9-34-3-officialcommentol16">
        Subsection 3(c) is new. The 1962 Act does not expressly allocate the burden of proof with regard to establishing whether a foreign-country judgment is within the scope of the Act. Courts applying the 1962 Act generally have held that the burden of proof is on the person seeking recognition to establish that the judgment is final, conclusive and enforceable where rendered.  E.g., Mayekawa Mfg. Co. Ltd. v. Sasaki, 888 P.2d 183, 189 (Wash. App. 1995) (burden of proof on creditor to establish judgment is final, conclusive, and enforceable where rendered);  Bridgeway Corp. v. Citibank,

       <li id="t09c34s9-34-4-officialcommentol11">
        This Section provides the standards for recognition of a foreign-country money judgment. Section 7 sets out the effect of recognition of a foreign-country money judgment under this Act.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c34s9-34-4-officialcommentol12">
        Recognition of a judgment means that the forum court accepts the determination of legal rights and obligations made by the rendering court in the foreign country.  See, e.g. Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Laws, Ch. 5, Topic 3, Introductory Note (recognition of foreign judgment occurs to the extent the forum court gives the judgment “the same effect with respect to the parties, the subject matter of the action and the issues involved that it has in the state where it was rendered.”) Recognition of a foreign-country judgment must be distinguished from enforcement of that judgment. Enforcement of the foreign-country judgment involves the application of the legal procedures of the state to ensure that the judgment debtor obeys the foreign-country judgment. Recognition of a foreign-country money judgment often is associated with enforcement of the judgment, as the judgment creditor usually seeks recognition of the foreign-country judgment primarily for the purpose of invoking the enforcement procedures of the forum state to assist the judgment creditor’s collection of the judgment from the judgment debtor. Because the forum court cannot enforce the foreign-country judgment until it has determined that the judgment will be given effect, recognition is a prerequisite to enforcement of the foreign-country judgment. Recognition, however, also has significance outside the enforcement context because a foreign-country judgment also must be recognized before it can be given preclusive effect under res judicata and collateral estoppel principles. The issue of whether a foreign-country judgment will be recognized is distinct from both the issue of whether the judgment will be enforced, and the issue of the extent to which it will be given preclusive effect.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c34s9-34-4-officialcommentol13">
        Subsection 4(a) places an affirmative duty on the forum court to recognize a foreign-country money judgment unless one of the grounds for nonrecognition stated in subsection (b) or (c) applies. Subsection (b) states three mandatory grounds for denying recognition to a foreign-country money judgment. If the forum court finds that one of the grounds listed in subsection (b) exists, then it must deny recognition to the foreign-country money judgment. Subsection (c) states eight nonmandatory grounds for denying recognition. The forum court has discretion to decide whether or not to refuse recognition based on one of these grounds. Subsection (d) places the burden of proof on the party resisting recognition of the foreign-country judgment to establish that one of the grounds for nonrecognition exists.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c34s9-34-4-officialcommentol14">
        The mandatory grounds for nonrecognition stated in subsection (b) are identical to the mandatory grounds stated in Section 4 of the 1962 Act. The discretionary grounds stated in subsection 4(c)(1) through (6) are based on subsection 4(b)(1) through (6) of the 1962 Act. The discretionary grounds stated in subsection 4(c)(7) and (8) are new.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c34s9-34-4-officialcommentol15">
        Under subsection (b)(1), the forum court must deny recognition to the foreign-country money judgment if that judgment was “rendered under a judicial system that does not provide impartial tribunals or procedures compatible with the requirements of due process of law.” The standard for this ground for nonrecognition “has been stated authoritatively by the  Supreme Court of the United States in  Hilton v. Guyot, 159 U.S.113, 205 (1895). As indicated in that decision, a mere difference in the procedural system is not a sufficient basis for nonrecognition. A case of serious injustice must be involved.” Cmt § 4, Uniform Foreign Money-Judgment Recognition Act (1962). The focus of inquiry is not whether the procedure in the rendering country is similar to U.S. procedure, but rather on the basic fairness of the foreign-country procedure.  Kam-Tech Systems, Ltd. V. Yardeni,

Procedural differences, such as absence of jury trial or different evidentiary rules are not sufficient to justify denying recognition under subsection (b)(1), so long as the essential elements of impartial administration and basic procedural fairness have been provided in the foreign proceeding. As the U.S. Supreme Court stated in  Hilton:
        <p id="t09c34s9-34-4-officialcommentol15.1">
         Where there has been opportunity for a full and fair trial abroad before a court of competent jurisdiction conducting the trial upon regular proceedings, after due citation or voluntary appearance of the defendant, and under a system of jurisprudence likely to secure an impartial administration of justice between the citizens of its own country and those of other countries, and there is nothing to show either prejudice in the court, or in the system of laws under which it was sitting, or fraud in procuring the judgment, or any other special reason why the comity of this nation should not allow it full effect then a foreign-country judgment should be recognized.

        Under section 4(b)(2), the forum court must deny recognition to the foreign-country judgment if the foreign court did not have personal jurisdiction over the defendant. Section 5(a) lists six bases for personal jurisdiction that are adequate as a matter of law to establish that the foreign court had personal jurisdiction. Section 5(b) makes clear that other grounds for personal jurisdiction may be found sufficient.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c34s9-34-4-officialcommentol17">
        Subsection 4(c)(2) limits the type of fraud that will serve as a ground for denying recognition to extrinsic fraud. This provision is consistent with the interpretation of the comparable provision in subsection 4(b)(2) of the 1962 Act by the courts, which have found that only extrinsic fraud — conduct of the prevailing party that deprived the losing party of an adequate opportunity to present its case — is sufficient under the 1962 Act. Examples of extrinsic fraud would be when the plaintiff deliberately had the initiating process served on the defendant at the wrong address, deliberately gave the defendant wrong information as to the time and place of the hearing, or obtained a default judgment against the defendant based on a forged confession of judgment. When this type of fraudulent action by the plaintiff deprives the defendant of an adequate opportunity to present its case, then it provides grounds for denying recognition of the foreign-country judgment. Extrinsic fraud should be distinguished from intrinsic fraud, such as false testimony of a witness or admission of a forged document into evidence during the foreign proceeding. Intrinsic fraud does not provide a basis for denying recognition under subsection 4(c)(2), as the assertion that intrinsic fraud has occurred should be raised and dealt with in the rendering court.

       <li id="t09c34s9-34-4-officialcommentol18">
        The public policy exception in subsection 4(c)(3) is based on the public policy exception in subsection 4(b)(3) of the 1962 Act, with one difference. The public policy exception in the 1962 Act states that the relevant inquiry is whether “the [cause of action] [claim for relief] on which the judgment is based” is repugnant to public policy. Based on this “cause of action” language, some courts interpreting the 1962 Act have refused to find that a public policy challenge based on something other than repugnancy of the foreign cause of action comes within this exception.  E.g., Southwest Livestock &amp; Trucking Co., Inc. v. Ramon,
        <cite class="ocri">
         169 F.3d 317
        </cite>
        (5th Cir. 1999) (refusing to deny recognition to Mexican judgment on promissory note with interest rate of 48% because cause of action to collect on promissory note does not violate public policy);  Guinness PLC v. Ward,
        <cite class="ocri">
         955 F.2d 875
        </cite>
        (4th Cir. 1992) (challenge to recognition based on post-judgment settlement could not be asserted under public policy exception);  The Society of Lloyd’s v. Turner,

         303 F.3d 325
        </cite>
        (5th Cir. 2002) (rejecting argument legal standards applied to establish elements of breach of contract violated public policy because cause of action for breach of contract itself is not contrary to state public policy);  cf.Bachchan v. India Abroad Publications, Inc., 585 N.Y.S.2d 661 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1992) (judgment creditor argued British libel judgment should be recognized despite argument it violated First Amendment because New York recognizes a cause of action for libel). Subsection 4(c)(3) rejects this narrow focus by providing that the forum court may deny recognition if either the cause of action or the judgment itself violates public policy.  Cf.Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States, § 482(2)(d) (1986) (containing a similarly-worded public policy exception to recognition).
        <p id="t09c34s9-34-4-officialcommentol18.1">
         Although subsection 4(c)(3) of this Act rejects the narrow focus on the cause of action under the 1962 Act, it retains the stringent test for finding a public policy violation applied by courts interpreting the 1962 Act. Under that test, a difference in law, even a marked one, is not sufficient to raise a public policy issue. Nor is it relevant that the foreign law allows a recovery that the forum state would not allow. Public policy is violated only if recognition or enforcement of the foreign-country judgment would tend clearly to injure the public health, the public morals, or the public confidence in the administration of law, or would undermine “that sense of security for individual rights, whether of personal liberty or of private property, which any citizen ought to feel.”

         The language “or of the United States” in subsection 4(c)(3), which does not appear in the 1962 Act provision, makes it clear that the relevant public policy is that of both the State in which recognition is sought and that of the United States. This is the position taken by the vast majority of cases interpreting the 1962 public policy provision.
         E.g., Bachchan v. India Abroad Publications, Inc., 585 N.Y.S.2d 661 (Sup.Ct. N.Y. 1992) (British libel judgment denied recognition because it violates First Amendment).

        Subsection 4(c)(5) allows the forum court to refuse recognition of a foreign-country judgment when the parties had a valid agreement, such as a valid forum selection clause or agreement to arbitrate, providing that the relevant dispute would be resolved in a forum other than the forum issuing the foreign-country judgment. Under this provision, the forum court must find both the existence of a valid agreement and that the agreement covered the subject matter involved in the foreign litigation resulting in the foreign-country judgment.

       <li id="t09c34s9-34-4-officialcommentol110">
        Subsection 4(c)(6) authorizes the forum court to refuse recognition of a foreign-country judgment that was rendered in the foreign country solely on the basis of personal service when the forum court believes the original action should have been dismissed by the court in the foreign country on grounds of forum non conveniens.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c34s9-34-4-officialcommentol111">
        Subsection 4(c)(7) is new. Under this subsection, the forum court may deny recognition to a foreign-country judgment if there are circumstances that raise substantial doubt about the integrity of the rendering court with respect to that judgment. It requires a showing of corruption in the particular case that had an impact on the judgment that was rendered. This provision may be contrasted with subsection 4(b)(1), which requires that the forum court refuse recognition to the foreign-country judgment if it was rendered under a judicial system that does not provide impartial tribunals. Like the comparable provision in subsection 4(a)(1) of the 1962 Act, subsection 4(b)(1) focuses on the judicial system of the foreign country as a whole, rather than on whether the particular judicial proceeding leading to the foreign-country judgment was impartial and fair.  See, e.g.,  The Society of Lloyd’s v. Turner,
        <cite class="ocri">
         303 F.3d 325
        </cite>
        , 330 (5th Cir. 2002) (interpreting the 1962 Act); CIBC Mellon Trust Co. v. Mora Hotel Corp,.  N.V., 743 N.Y.S.2d 408, 415 (N.Y. App. 2002) (interpreting the 1962 Act);  Society of Lloyd’s v. Ashenden,
        <cite class="ocri">
         233 F.3d 473
        </cite>
        , 477 (7th Cir. 2000) (interpreting the 1962 Act). On the other hand, subsection 4(c)(7) allows the court to deny recognition to the foreign-country judgment if it finds a lack of impartiality and fairness of the tribunal in the individual proceeding leading to the foreign-country judgment. Thus, the difference is that between showing, for example, that corruption and bribery is so prevalent throughout the judicial system of the foreign country as to make that entire judicial system one that does not provide impartial tribunals versus showing that bribery of the judge in the proceeding that resulted in the particular foreign-country judgment under consideration had a sufficient impact on the ultimate judgment as to call it into question.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c34s9-34-4-officialcommentol112">
        Subsection 4(c)(8) also is new. It allows the forum court to deny recognition to the foreign-country judgment if the court finds that the specific proceeding in the foreign court was not compatible with the requirements of fundamental fairness. Like subsection 4(c)(7), it can be contrasted with subsection 4(b)(1), which requires the forum court to deny recognition to the foreign-country judgment if the forum court finds that the entire judicial system in the foreign country where the foreign-country judgment was rendered does not provide procedures compatible with the requirements of fundamental fairness. While the focus of subsection 4(b)(1) is on the foreign country’s judicial system as a whole, the focus of subsection 4(c)(8) is on the particular proceeding that resulted in the specific foreign-country judgment under consideration. Thus, the difference is that between showing, for example, that there has been such a breakdown of law and order in the particular foreign country that judgments are rendered on the basis of political decisions rather than the rule of law throughout the judicial system versus a showing that for political reasons the particular party against whom the foreign-country judgment was entered was denied fundamental fairness in the particular proceedings leading to the foreign-country judgment.
        <p id="t09c34s9-34-4-officialcommentol112.1">
         Subsections 4(c)(7) and (8) both are discretionary grounds for denying recognition, while subsection 4(b)(1) is mandatory. Obviously, if the entire judicial system in the foreign country fails to satisfy the requirements of impartiality and fundamental fairness, a judgment rendered in that foreign country would be so compromised that the forum court should refuse to recognize it as a matter of course. On the other hand, if the problem is evidence of a lack of integrity or fundamental fairness with regard to the particular proceeding leading to the foreign-country judgment, then there may or may not be other factors in the particular case that would cause the forum court to decide to recognize the foreign-country judgment. For example, a forum court might decide not to exercise its discretion to deny recognition despite evidence of corruption or procedural unfairness in a particular case because the party resisting recognition failed to raise the issue on appeal from the foreign-country judgment in the foreign country, and the evidence establishes that, if the party had done so, appeal would have been an adequate mechanism for correcting the transgressions of the lower court.

       <li id="t09c34s9-34-4-officialcommentol113">
        Under subsection 4(d), the party opposing recognition of the foreign-country judgment has the burden of establishing that one of the grounds for nonrecognition set out in subsection 4(b) or (c) applies. The 1962 Act was silent as to who had the burden of proof to establish a ground for nonrecognition and courts applying the 1962 Act took different positions on the issue.  CompareBridgeway Corp. v. Citibank,
        <cite class="ocri">
         45 F. Supp. 2
        </cite>
        d 276, 285 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (plaintiff has burden to show no mandatory basis under 4(a) for nonrecognition exists; defendant has burden regarding discretionary bases)  withThe Courage Co. LLC v. The ChemShare Corp., 93 S.W.3d 323, 331 (Tex. App. 2002) (party seeking to avoid recognition has burden to prove ground for nonrecognition). Because the grounds for nonrecognition in Section 4 are in the nature of defenses to recognition, the burden of proof is most appropriately allocated to the party opposing recognition of the foreign-country judgment.

        Under section 4(b)(2), the forum court must deny recognition to the foreign-country judgment if the foreign court did not have personal jurisdiction over the defendant. Section 5(a) lists six bases for personal jurisdiction that are adequate as a matter of law to establish that the foreign court had personal jurisdiction. Section 5(b) makes it clear that these bases of personal jurisdiction are not exclusive.

        Unlike the 1962 Act, which was silent as to the proper procedure for seeking recognition of a foreign-country judgment, Section 6 of this Act expressly sets out the ways in which the issue of recognition may be raised. Under section 6, the issue of recognition always must be raised in a court proceeding. Thus, section 6 rejects decisions under the 1962 Act holding that the registration procedure found in the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act could be utilized with regard to recognition of a foreign-country judgment.  E.g. Society of Lloyd’s v. Ashenden,
        <cite class="ocri">
         233 F.3d 473
        </cite>
        (7th Cir. 2000). The Enforcement Act deals solely with the  enforcement of sister-state judgments and other judgments entitled to full faith and credit, not with the  recognition of foreign-country judgments.
        <p id="t09c34s9-34-6-officialcommentol11.1">
         More broadly, section 6 rejects the use of any registration procedure in the context of the foreign-country judgments covered by this Act. A registration procedure represents a balance between the interest of the judgment creditor in obtaining quick and efficient recognition and enforcement of a judgment when the judgment debtor has already been provided with an opportunity to litigate the underlying issues, and the interest of the judgment debtor in being provided an adequate opportunity to raise and litigate issues regarding whether the foreign-country judgment should be recognized. In the context of sister-state judgments, this balance favors use of a truncated procedure such as that found in the Enforcement Act. Recognition of sister-state judgments normally is mandated by the Full Faith and Credit Clause. Courts recognize only a very limited number of grounds for denying full faith and credit to a sister-state judgment – that the rendering court lacked jurisdiction, that the judgment was procured by fraud, that the judgment has been satisfied, or that the limitations period has expired. Thus, the judgment debtor with regard to a sister-state judgment normally does not have any grounds for opposing recognition and enforcement of the judgment. The extremely limited grounds for denying full faith and credit to a sister-state judgment reflect the fact such judgments will have been rendered by a court that is subject to the same due process limitations and the same overlap of federal statutory and constitutional law as the forum state’s courts, and, to a large extent, the same body of court precedent and socio-economic ideas as those shaping the law of the forum state. Therefore, there is a strong presumption of fairness and competence attached to a sister-state judgment that justifies use of a registration procedure.
        </p>
        <p id="t09c34s9-34-6-officialcommentol11.2">
         The balance between the benefits and costs of a registration procedure is significantly different, however, in the context of recognition and enforcement of foreign-country judgments. Unlike the limited grounds for denying full faith and credit to a sister-state judgment, this Act provides a number of grounds upon which recognition of a foreign-country judgment may be denied. Determination of whether these grounds apply requires the forum court to look behind the foreign-country judgment to evaluate the law and the judicial system under which the foreign-country judgment was rendered. The existence of these grounds for nonrecognition reflects the fact there is less expectation that foreign-country courts will follow procedures comporting with U.S. notions of fundamental fairness and jurisdiction or that those courts will apply laws viewed as substantively tolerable by U.S. standards than there is with regard to sister-state courts. In some situations, there also may be suspicions of corruption or fraud in the foreign-country proceedings. These differences between sister-state judgments and foreign-country judgments provide a justification for requiring judicial involvement in the decision whether to recognize a foreign-country judgment in all cases in which that issue is raised. Although the threshold for establishing that a foreign-country judgment is not entitled to recognition under Section 4 is high, there is a sufficiently greater likelihood that significant recognition issues will be raised so as to require a judicial proceeding.

        This Section contemplates that the issue of recognition may be raised either as an original matter or in the context of a pending proceeding. Subsection 6(a) provides that in order to raise the issue of recognition of a foreign-country judgment as an initial matter, the party seeking recognition must file an action for recognition of the foreign-country judgment. Subsection 6(b) provides that when the recognition issue is raised in a pending proceeding, it may be raised by counterclaim, cross-claim or affirmative defense, depending on the context in which it is raised. These rules are consistent with the way the issue of recognition most often was raised in most states under the 1962 Act.

       <li id="t09c34s9-34-6-officialcommentol13">
        An action seeking recognition of a foreign-country judgment under this Section is an action on the foreign-country judgment itself, not an action on the underlying cause of action that gave rise to that judgment. The parties to an action under Section 6 may not relitigate the merits of the underlying dispute that gave rise to the foreign-country judgment.

        While this Section sets out the ways in which the issue of recognition of a foreign-country judgment may be raised, it is not intended to create any new procedure not currently existing in the state or to otherwise effect existing state procedural requirements. The parties to an action in which recognition of a foreign-country judgment is sought under Section 6 must comply with all state procedural rules with regard to that type of action. Nor does this Act address the question of what constitutes a sufficient basis for jurisdiction to adjudicate with regard to an action under Section 6. Courts have split over the issue of whether the presence of assets of the debtor in a state is a sufficient basis for jurisdiction in light of footnote 36 of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in  Shaffer v. Heitner,

        Section 5 of this Act sets out the standards for the recognition of foreign-country judgments within the scope of this Act, and places an affirmative duty on the forum court to recognize any foreign-country judgment that meets those standards. Section 6 of this Act sets out the procedures by which the issue of recognition may be raised. This Section sets out the consequences of the decision by the forum court that the foreign-country judgment is entitled to recognition.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c34s9-34-7-officialcommentol12">
        Under subsection 7(1), the first consequence of recognition of a foreign-country judgment is that it is treated as conclusive between the parties in the forum state. Section 7(1) does not attempt to establish directly the extent of that conclusiveness. Instead, it provides that the foreign-country judgment is treated as conclusive to the same extent that a judgment of a sister state that had been determined to be entitled to full faith and credit would be conclusive. This means that the foreign-country judgment generally will be given the same effect in the forum state that it has in the foreign country where it was rendered. Subsection 7(1), however, sets out the minimum effect that must be given to the foreign-country judgment once recognized. The forum court remains free to give the foreign-country judgment a greater preclusive effect in the forum state than the judgment would have in the foreign country where it was rendered.  Cf.Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States, § 481 cmt  c (1986).
       </li>
       <li id="t09c34s9-34-7-officialcommentol13">
        Under subsection 7(2), the second consequence of recognition of a foreign-country judgment is that, to the extent it grants a sum of money, it is enforceable in the forum state in accordance with the procedures for enforcement in the forum state and to the same extent that a judgment of the forum state would be enforceable.  Cf.Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States § 481 (1986) (judgment entitled to recognition is enforceable in accordance with the procedure for enforcement of judgments applicable where enforcement is sought). Thus, under subsection 7(2), once recognized, the foreign-country judgment has the same effect and is subject to the same procedures, defenses and proceedings for reopening, vacating, or staying a judgment of a comparable court in the forum state, and can be enforced or satisfied in the same manner as such a judgment of the forum state.

        Under Section 3 of this Act, a foreign-country judgment is not within the scope of this Act unless it is conclusive and enforceable where rendered. Thus, if the effect of appeal under the law of the foreign country in which the judgment was rendered is to prevent it from being conclusive or enforceable between the parties, the existence of a pending appeal in the foreign country would prevent the application of this Act. Section 8 addresses a different situation. It deals with the situation in which either (1) the party seeking a stay has demonstrated that it intends to file an appeal in the foreign country, although the appeal has not yet been filed or (2) an appeal has been filed in the foreign country, but under the law of the foreign country filing of an appeal does not affect the conclusiveness or enforceability of the judgment. Section 8 allows the forum court in those situations to determine in its discretion that a stay of proceedings is appropriate.

       Source: This Section is new. The 1962 Act did not contain a statute of limitations. Some courts applying the 1962 Act have used the state’s general statute of limitations,
       e.g.
       , Vrozos v. Sarantopoulos, 552 N.E.2d 1053 (Ill. App. 1990) (as Recognition Act contains no statute of limitations, general five-year statute of limitations applies), while others have used the statute of limitations applicable with regard to enforcement of a domestic judgment,
       <i>
        e.g.
       </i>
       , La Societe Anonyme Goro v. Conveyor Accessories, Inc., 677 N.E. 2d 30 (Ill. App. 1997).

      <ol>
       <li id="t09c34s9-34-9-officialcommentol11">
        Under Section 3 of this Act, this Act only applies to foreign-country judgments that are conclusive, and if the judgment grants recovery of a sum of money, enforceable where rendered. Thus, if the period of effectiveness of the foreign-country judgment has expired in the foreign country where the judgment was rendered, the foreign-country judgment would not be subject to this Act. This means that the period of time during which a foreign-country judgment may be recognized under this Act normally is measured by the period of time during which that judgment is effective (that is, conclusive and, if applicable, enforceable) in the foreign country that rendered the judgment. If, however, the foreign-country judgment remains effective for more than fifteen years after the date on which it became effective in the foreign country, Section 9 places an additional time limit on recognition of a foreign-country judgment. It provides that, if the foreign-country judgment remains effective between the parties for more than fifteen years, then an action to recognize the foreign-country judgment under this Act must be commenced within that fifteen year period.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c34s9-34-9-officialcommentol12">
        Section 9 does not address the issue of whether a foreign-country judgment that can no longer be the basis of a recognition action under this Act because of the application of the fifteen-year limitations period in Section 9 may be used for other purposes. For example, a common rule with regard to judgments barred by a statute of limitations is that they still may be used defensively for purposes of offset and for their preclusive effect. The extent to which a foreign-country judgment with regard to which a recognition action is barred by Section 9 may be used for these or other purposes is left to the other law of the forum state.

        Section 3 of this Act provides that this Act applies only to certain foreign-country judgments that grant or deny recovery of a sum of money. The purpose of this Act is to establish the minimum standards for recognition of those judgments. Section 11 makes clear that no negative implication should be read from the fact that this Act does not provide for recognition of other foreign-country judgments. Rather, this Act simply does not address the issue of whether foreign-country judgments not within its scope under Section 3 should be recognized. Courts are free to recognize those foreign-country judgments not within the scope of this Act under common law principles of comity or other applicable law.

       This Act establishes a registration procedure for recognition and enforcement of Canadian money judgments as an alternative to the procedure found in Section 6 of the Uniform Foreign-Country Money Judgments Recognition Act (UFCMJRA), which requires that recognition be sought through a judicial proceeding. The Act is drafted to supplement and integrate into the UFCMJRA and relies on the rules of the UFCMJRA with regard to recognition of foreign-country money judgments, other than the UFCMJRA requirement that an action be filed. The Act also establishes a registration procedure that is similar, to the extent practicable, to the Canadian registration procedure regarding foreign-country judgments contained in the Canadian Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (UEFJA).

        Under subsection (a), this Act applies to a Canadian money judgment to the extent the judgment comes within the scope of the UFCMJRA. Section 3 of the UFCMJRA provides that the UFCMJRA applies to a foreign-country judgment to the extent the judgment (1) grants or denies recovery of a sum of money; and is (2) final, conclusive and enforceable under the law of the rendering jurisdiction. UFCMJRA Section 3 excludes (1) a judgment for taxes; (2) a fine or other penalty; and (3) a judgment for divorce, support, or maintenance, or other judgment in connection with domestic relations. These requirements and exclusions are incorporated into this Act.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-3-officialcommentol12">
        Harmonization with the Canadian UEFJA is only partial with regard to the kind of judgments that are included in the Act. The Canadian UEFJA is not limited to money judgments; it applies more broadly to a final order or judgment in a civil proceeding. The policy decision was made, however, to limit the scope of this Act to judgments that are within the scope of both the UFCMJRA and the Canadian UEFJA. Because the scope of the UFCMJRA is narrower than that of the Canadian UEFJA, the scope of this Act is limited to the scope of the UFCMJRA.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-3-officialcommentol13">
        The Canadian UEFJA contains exclusions for (1) recovery of taxes; (2) maintenance or support; and (3) recovery of monetary fines or penalties that are sufficiently similar to those in Section 3 of the UFCMJRA as to not affect harmonization. The Canadian UEFJA also contains three exclusions not found in the UFCMJRA – foreign judgments: (1) “arising out of bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings”; (2) “that recognize the judgment of another foreign State;” and (3) that were “rendered in proceedings commenced before the coming into force of [the Canadian UEFJA]”. There is no need to address the bankruptcy exclusion in this Act because U.S. bankruptcy law requires that the type of judgment covered by this exclusion – a foreign money judgment against a debtor in bankruptcy or its estate – be filed in the bankruptcy proceedings rather than under the UFCMJRA. The exclusion for a judgment recognizing the judgment of another foreign State is dealt with in this Act by excluding that type of judgment from the definition of “Canadian judgment” in Section 2(2). The third exclusion is addressed in Section 11 of this Act, which provides that the Act applies only to proceedings commenced on or after the effective date of the Act.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-3-officialcommentol14">
        In addition to limiting the type of judgments to which this Act applies to those within the scope of the UFCMJRA, Section 3(a) provides that the Act applies only “if recognition of the judgment is sought to enforce the judgment.” This latter limit, which is not found in the UFCMJRA, is intended to exclude from the Act situations in which recognition is sought solely for the purpose of obtaining the preclusive effect of the Canadian money judgment. This issue is discussed further in Comments 1 and 2 to Section 4.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-3-officialcommentol15">
        Subsections (b) and (c) deal with “mixed judgments” – judgments that are partially within and partially outside of the scope of the Act. The UFCMJRA deals with this issue by providing in UFCMJRA Section 3 that the UFCMJRA applies to mixed judgments “to the extent” they are within its scope. This section also uses the “to the extent” formulation in order to track the scope of the UFCMJRA. In addition, subsections (b) and (c) make it clear that a mixed judgment may be registered to the extent that it involves the type of relief and subject matter that is within the scope of the UFCMJRA and thus within the scope of this Act.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-3-officialcommentol16">
        A Canadian judgment could contain elements that are within the scope of this Act, and others that are not, in two ways. First, the judgment could combine a monetary award (which would be within the Act’s scope) with a non-monetary award, such as an injunction (which would not be within its scope). See UFCMJRA Section 3(a). Second, the judgment could relate to both a subject matter within the scope of the Act and one that is excluded. See UFCMJRA Section 3(b). Subsection (b) addresses the first situation, providing that a judgment that grants both monetary and non-monetary relief may be registered, but only to the extent of the grant of monetary relief. Subsection (c) addresses the second situation, providing that a judgment rendered with regard to both a subject matter within the scope of the Act and one that is outside its scope may be registered, but only to the extent the judgment relates to the subject matter within the scope of this Act.

       <li id="t09c35s9-35-4-commentol11">
        Section 3(a) states the scope of this Act in terms of both the  type of judgment (this Act applies to a judgment to the extent the judgment is a type of judgment to which the UFCMJRA applies) and in terms of the  purpose for which recognition is sought (recognition must be sought in order to enforce the judgment). Accordingly, subsection (a) provides that a person may register a Canadian judgment if recognition is sought in order to enforce the judgment – that is, if the person registering the judgment is doing so in order to use available procedures in the state to collect the amount of the judgment from the assets of a person who is obligated to pay the judgment. The registration procedure thus is not available when recognition of a Canadian judgment is sought solely to establish its preclusive effect with regard to the determination of the dispute (or issues in the dispute) by the rendering court. In most instances, the issue of recognition of a foreign judgment solely to establish its preclusive effect will be raised in the course of an already-initiated court proceeding, and, therefore, is best dealt with under the procedures of Section 6 of the UFCMJRA.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-4-commentol12">
        The term “enforce” as used in subsection (a) includes any means provided by the law of this state by which a person may seek to collect the judgment from the assets of the person obligated on the judgment. Enforcement does not necessarily require an affirmative act on the part of the person seeking to collect. For example, in some states, a judgment creates a lien against the judgment debtor’s real estate without any action by the judgment creditor. A person registering a Canadian judgment for the purpose of obtaining this automatic lien would meet the requirement of subsection (a). Subsection (a) also does not affect any of the rules with regard to enforcement of judgments under the law of this state, including the time in which a judgment creditor may enforce a judgment. The requirement that the registration be for the purpose of enforcement does not mean that enforcement must be the sole reason for registration. Indeed, under Section 5, one of the consequences of registration is that the judgment is conclusive between the parties. It is only when recognition is sought  solely to obtain preclusive effect that registration is not available. The person against whom the judgment has been registered has the burden of establishing that the judgment was not registered for the purpose of enforcement.  See Section 7.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-4-commentol13">
        Subsection (b)(1) is based on Canadian UEFJA Section 12(4)(a), which provides that the appropriate authentication is that of the court of origin.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-4-commentol14">
        While the authentication under subsection (b)(1) is that of the court of origin, the method of authentication is determined by this state as the forum asked to recognize the judgment. The procedure contemplated is that required in this state for the authentication of a foreign-country judgment in connection with an action under UFCMJRA Section 6.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-4-commentol15">
        Subsection (b)(2) requires basic information identifying the person registering the Canadian judgment – that is, the person in whose favor the judgment was rendered or a successor in interest to that person. If the person registering the judgment is not the original party in whose favor the judgment was rendered, subsection (b)(3) requires the person registering the judgment to explain why it is entitled to have the judgment recognized and enforced.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-4-commentol16">
        Subsection (b)(4) requires basic information about the person against whom the judgment is being registered. The most up-to-date information available to the person registering the judgment is required.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-4-commentol17">
        Subsection (b)(5) addresses the issue of mixed judgments. If the Canadian judgment is only partially within the scope of the Act, the part of the judgment within the Act may be registered, see Section 3, but the person registering the judgment must provide a description of that part.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-4-commentol18">
        Subsection (b)(6) requires information about the amount of the judgment for which registration is sought, including the amount of accrued interest, costs and expenses and attorney’s fees. The primary purpose of this information is to allow the person against whom the judgment is registered to determine how the amount of the judgment for which registration is sought was determined and the components that make up that amount. If only part of the judgment is being registered, the person registering the judgment is required to allocate the appropriate amounts to the part being registered.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-4-commentol19">
        Subsection (b)(7) requires information about the amount of post-judgment costs, expenses, and attorney’s fees included in the amount for which enforcement of the judgment is sought. The amounts included are “as of the date of registration,” which would include any amount up to the time of filing the registration. Unlike the amounts included under subsection (b)(6), post-judgment amounts claimed are not likely to have been approved by a court. As with regard to other amounts stated in the registration, however, the burden is on the person against whom the judgment is being registered to object to these amounts, if the person believes they are not accurate.  See Section 7(b)(2).
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-4-commentol110">
        Subsection (b)(8) requires the person registering the judgment to state the amount of the judgment that has been satisfied as of the filing of the registration. The total of the amounts stated in subsections (b)(6) and (7) less the amount stated in (b)(8) should equal the amount for which enforcement is sought. If only a part of the judgment is subject to being registered, then the amount satisfied will be the amount satisfied with regard to the part of the judgment being registered.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-4-commentol111">
        This Act does not address the question of the conversion rule to be used with regard to the amounts subsection (b) requires to be stated. In this regard, this Act follows the UFCMJRA, which also leaves this issue to other law of the state. In contrast, compare Canadian UEFJA Section 13, which explicitly adopts the date of payment conversion rule. The date of payment rule also is the conversion rule adopted in the Uniform Foreign-Money Claims Act and the prevalent rule in many other countries. The intent of this Act is that the conversion rule applied will be the same conversion rule as would be used in an action under UFCMJRA Section 6 in this state. Depending on the conversion rule used, the amounts under subsection (b) may in some instances be stated in more than one currency.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-4-commentol112">
        Subsection (b)(9) requires the person seeking registration to provide a statement that the judgment to be registered is of a type to which the UFCMJRA (and thus this Act) applies. Under UFCMJRA Section 3(c), the party seeking recognition has the burden to establish that the UFCMJRA applies to the foreign-country judgment.  Cf. The Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements of 30 June 2005, Art. 13 1. d) (requiring person seeking recognition of a judgment to produce “any documents necessary to establish that the judgment has effect or, where applicable, is enforceable in the State of origin”). The same is true under this Act.  See Section 9(a) (except for UFCMJRA Section 6, UFCMJRA rules apply to registration under this Act). If only a portion of the judgment is within the scope of the UFCMJRA (and thus subject to registration under this Act), subsection (b)(9)(C) requires the person registering the judgment to affirm that the amounts stated in the registration pursuant to subsection (b)(6), (7) and (8) relate to the part being registered.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-4-commentol113">
        Subsection (b)(10) requires a certified translation of the judgment into English, if the original judgment is not in English. What constitutes an acceptable certification is left to other law of the state. The intent is that what would constitute an acceptable certification of a translation of a Canadian judgment in an action for recognition under UFCMJRA Section 6 also would be an acceptable certification under this Act.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-4-commentol114">
        Subsection (b)(11) requires payment of a registration fee to the Clerk of Court. It is based on Section 5 of the ULC Revised Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (1964) (dealing with registration of sister-state judgments). Payment of this registration fee is a requirement for issuance of a docket number and entry in the docket by the Clerk of Court under subsection (c).
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-4-commentol115">
        In addition to payment of the registration fee, subsection (c) makes receipt of a registration that includes all the documents and information listed in subsection (b) a requirement for the Clerk of Court to register the judgment, issue a docket number (required under Section 6 to give notice to the person against whom registration of the judgment is sought) and enter the registration in the Court’s registration docket.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-4-commentol116">
        Subsection (b) requires that the registration be executed by the person registering the judgment or that person’s attorney. The word “executed” was chosen rather than the word “authenticated” or “signed” in order to avoid any connotation as to whether the requirement can be satisfied by an electronic signature. Whether the court will accept the registration of a Canadian judgment as an electronic filing is left to other law of the state.

        Section 4 does not require that the information necessary for registration be provided in any particular form. Subsection (d), however, provides a standard form for registration of a Canadian money judgment under this Act. Use of the form is voluntary; however, its use does provide a safe harbor. Under subsection (d), a registration substantially as provided by the form and including the attachments specified in the form meets the requirements for registration under subsection (b). The form requests certain information that is not required by subsection (b), but which is practical and helpful. This information is marked as “optional” on the form. Failure to provide this optional information does not affect the determination of whether a submission is substantially as provided by the form.

       The state should select between the bracketed terms “garnishment” and “trustee process” depending on how this type of enforcement action is described in state law.

        The effect of registration under this Act is that the judgment is considered recognized, subject to a period during which certain means of enforcing the judgment are prohibited in order to provide the person against whom the judgment has been registered an opportunity to raise any defenses that would cause the registration to be vacated. Subsection (a) states the basic rule that a registered judgment is given the same effect as a judgment that has been determined by a court to be entitled to recognition under Section 7 of the UFCMJRA. Thus, once registered, (and subject to the period provided in subsection (b)), a Canadian judgment is (1) conclusive between the parties to the same extent as the judgment of a sister-state entitled to full faith and credit and (2) enforceable in the same manner and to the same extent as a judgment rendered in the recognizing state.  See UFCMJRA § 7. Section 14 of the Canadian UEFJA contains similar provisions, providing that, “[o]n registration, a foreign judgment is enforceable as if it were a judgment of the enforcing court,” and the enforcing court “has the same jurisdiction and control over a registered foreign judgment as it has over its own judgments and may order enforcement in respect of one or more of its parts.”
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-5-commentol12">
        Subsection (b) provides that the person registering the judgment may not enforce the judgment by sale or other disposition of property or by seizure or garnishment of property until 31 days after service of notice of the registration on the person against whom the judgment is registered. The intent of this subsection is to provide a period during which a person against whom a judgment has been registered can take action to have the registration vacated before being subject to enforcement acts that could be dispositive with regard to the person’s property. Section 14(3) of the Canadian UEFJA contains an analogous provision, which states that a registered judgment “may not be enforced by the sale or other disposition of any property of the judgment debtor before the expiry of 30 days after the judgment debtor has received notice of the proceedings to register the foreign judgment, or any longer period that the enforcing court may allow.” Harmonization on this issue is not complete, as subsection (b) prohibits enforcement acts that are short of final disposition of the property, but nevertheless may cause irreversible harm to the person against whom the judgment is registered.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-5-commentol13">
        Subsection (b) is a crucial provision in establishing an appropriate balance between protecting the person against whom the judgment is registered, who may have a valid defense to recognition of the judgment, and permitting the person registering the judgment to effectively and efficiently enforce its judgment, including avoiding dissipation of assets. Subsection (b) strikes this balance by, first, providing that until 31 days after service of notice of registration, the person registering the judgment may not enforce the registered judgment through disposition, seizure or garnishment of the property of the person against whom the judgment is registered. As discussed above, this prohibition on enforcement actions is broader than that in the Canadian UEFJA, Section 14(3), which only prohibits enforcement through sale or other disposition of the property. Expansion of the protection afforded the person against whom the judgment is registered was warranted because actions short of disposition, such as garnishment of bank accounts, could cause potentially irreversible harm. Subsection (b), however, also provides several protections of the interests of the person registering the judgment. The prohibition on enforcement actions does not prevent all actions related to enforcement, but only those specifically listed. Thus, for example, it does not prohibit discovery seeking information about property that may be available to satisfy the judgment. Nor does it prohibit enforcement activity short of seizure or garnishment, such as placing a lien on the property of the person against whom the judgment is registered. The person registering the judgment, therefore, is not prohibited from establishing its priority to the assets during the 30-day period vis a vis other creditors of the person against whom the judgment is registered. Subsection (b) also provides that the court may shorten the 30-day period (as well as lengthen it) for cause. (Section 14(3) of the Canadian UEFJA only allows the court to lengthen the period.) Finally, subsection (b) does not preclude use of other laws of the state that provide relief against dissipation, disposition or removal of assets potentially available to satisfy the judgment.

       <li id="t09c35s9-35-5-commentol14">
        Subsection (b) provides that the 30-day period during which certain enforcement acts are prohibited may be shortened or lengthened by the court for cause. Given the varied factual circumstances that will justify altering the period, establishing a specific standard is impracticable. Instead, the standard is left to judicial development. The “for cause” language is intended as a signal to the court that, although the decision to alter the time period is within its discretion, there should be a significant reason for altering the time period. It should not be altered as a matter of course, but only when there are circumstances that justify the lengthening or shortening. This is particularly the case as the 30-day time period in this section normally should coordinate with the 30-day period in Section 7 (a) during which the person against whom the judgment is registered may file a petition to vacate the registration.

        Subsection (a) requires that notice of the registration be served on the person against whom the judgment has been registered. Section 12(4)(b) of the Canadian UEFJA contains an analogous requirement.

       <li id="t09c35s9-35-6-commentol12">
        The time of service of notice is a crucial measuring point under this Act. Both the 30-day non-enforcement period in Section 5(b) and the 30-day period in Section 7 (a) during which a person against whom a judgment is registered may file a petition to vacate the registration are measured from the time of service of notice. Prompt and adequate service of notice thus is critical to the ability of the person registering the judgment to enforce the registered judgment.

        Registering a Canadian judgment is an alternative to the commencement of a lawsuit for its recognition. Nevertheless, some of the rules that apply to commencement of a lawsuit also apply in the registration context. Subsection (b) provides that the manner in which notice is to be given is the same as that provided by the rules governing service of summons and complaint in an action for recognition of a foreign-country judgment. Cf. Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act of the Province of Alberta, § 6(1)(a) (notice of registration to be served “in the same manner as a statement of claim is required to be served”). The subsection (b) reference to other law for the specific methodology by which notice is given includes not only the rules governing the method of service, but also those concerning other service-related issues, such as the timing of service and the time by which proof of service must be filed with the clerk of court.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-6-commentol14">
        The requirement under subsection (b) that notice of registration be served in the same manner as a summons and complaint normally will result in personal service of the registration notice, and is an important protection for the person against whom the judgment is registered. The requirement also harmonizes the Act with Canadian law on this issue. Registration under both the Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Acts and the Canadian UEFJA requires personal service. The rationales for requiring personal service in Canada are that (1) registration is the commencement of a new process rather than a corollary to an existing one in the enforcing jurisdiction, (2) because the person against whom the judgment is registered can object to registration and enforcement, that person should receive personal notice of the intended action, and (3) personal service is the best way to establish when the timelines in the registration process commence. The rationales for the Canadian personal service requirement and the desire to maintain parity between the Canadian and U.S. registration procedures to the extent practicable, provide additional reasons for the personal service requirement in subsection (b).

Subsection (c)(5) requires that a statement be included in the notice informing the person against whom the judgment has been registered that the person has 30 days after service in which to petition the court to vacate the registration, subject to the court’s ability to alter that time period for cause.

        A primary consequence of a registration process for recognition of Canadian judgments is that it shifts the burden of invoking judicial scrutiny of the foreign judgment from the person seeking recognition of the judgment to the person seeking to avoid recognition. This section provides the procedure by which the person seeking to avoid recognition can invoke that judicial scrutiny. It provides that the person seeking to avoid recognition through registration may file a petition with the court within 30 days after service of notice of registration, stating its objections to recognition of the judgment by registration. The effect of filing a petition to vacate the registration is to invoke the judicial process for ultimate determination of whether the Canadian judgment will be registered, and, if the basis for vacating the registration is that the judgment is not entitled to recognition on a ground found in the UFCMJRA, for determination of whether the judgment is entitled to be recognized in accordance with the UFCMJRA as well. See subsection (e) and comment 8 below. Once a petition to vacate the registration is filed, the case will move forward as a matter to be determined by the court.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-7-commentol12">
        Subsection (a) requires that a petition to vacate the registration be filed with the court no later than 30 days after the person against whom the judgment is registered is served with notice under Section 6. The court may shorten or lengthen the filing period for cause. Given the varied factual circumstances that will justify altering the period, establishing a specific standard is impracticable. Instead, the standard is left to judicial development. The “for cause” language is intended as a signal to the court that, although the decision to alter the time period is within its discretion, there should be a significant reason for altering the time period. It should not be altered as a matter of course, but only when there are circumstances that justify the lengthening or shortening. This is particularly the case as the 30-day time period in this section normally should coordinate with the 30-day period in Section 5(b) during which certain enforcement actions against the property of the person against whom the judgment is registered are prohibited.

       <li id="t09c35s9-35-7-commentol13">
        Subsection (b) divides the grounds upon which a registration may be vacated into two categories. Under subsection (b)(1), a judgment debtor may assert as a basis for vacating the registration any ground that could be asserted to deny recognition to the Canadian judgment under the UFCMJRA. Given the “plug in” relationship of this Act to the UFCMJRA, subsection (b)(1) references the grounds for refusing recognition under the UFCMJRA rather than restating them. The defenses to recognition of a foreign-country judgment under the UFCMJRA are contained in UFCMJRA Section 4. Under this section, those defenses also are available to vacate registration of the judgment.
        <p id="t09c35s9-35-7-commentol13.1">
         In addition to the UFCMJRA Section 4 defenses to recognition (which provide the only substantive grounds for denying recognition), there are other grounds for denying recognition under the UFCMJRA, and those grounds also are available to the person against whom the Canadian judgment has been registered under subsection (b)(1). For example, another ground for denying recognition to a judgment under the UFCMJRA is that the judgment is not one to which the UFCMJRA applies under UFCMJRA Section 3. Section 3 of this Act provides that this Act applies to a Canadian judgment to the extent the judgment is within the scope of the UFCMJRA; therefore, if a judgment does not come within the scope of UFCMJRA Section 3, it also cannot be registered under this Act. (Canadian judgments not within the scope of the UFCMJRA, and thus not within the scope of this Act, of course, still can be recognized by a court under principles of comity or other applicable law. See UFCMJRA Section 11.) A third ground for denying recognition to a judgment under the UFCMJRA is that the action is barred by the statute of limitations found in UFCMJRA Section 9. This ground also would be available under this section as a basis to vacate registration of the judgment. As these examples illustrate, the intent of subsection (b)(1) is to allow the person against whom registration is sought to raise as a ground for vacating the registration any ground that would be available in this state as a basis for denying recognition to the judgment under the UFCMJRA.

         Judgment Creditor registers a Canadian judgment against Judgment Debtor under Section 4 of this Act. Judgment Debtor files a timely petition to vacate the registration under this section on the ground that the Canadian court rendering the judgment did not have personal jurisdiction over Judgment Debtor. Under subsection (b)(1), Judgment Debtor may assert as a basis for vacating the registration any ground that could be asserted to deny recognition to the judgment under the UFCMJRA. UFCMJRA Section 4(b)(2) provides that a court “may not recognize a foreign-country judgment if … the foreign court did not have personal jurisdiction over the defendant … .” Therefore, Judgment Debtor may assert lack of personal jurisdiction as a basis for vacating the registration.

         vacate the registration because UFCMJRA Section 4(b)(2) makes denial of recognition mandatory when the court finds a lack of personal jurisdiction. In addition, under subsection (e) of this section, the court must enter a judgment denying recognition to the Canadian judgment, and the judgment denying recognition will have the same effect as a judgment denying recognition to a foreign judgment for lack of personal jurisdiction under the UFCMJRA – that is, the Canadian judgment will not be recognized in the state.

          Example 2.
         </b>
         Judgment Creditor registers a Canadian judgment against Judgment Debtor under Section 4 of this Act. Judgment Debtor files a timely petition to vacate the registration under this section on the ground that the Canadian judgment is characterized as a domestic relations judgment under U.S. law and thus is not a judgment to which the UFCMJRA, and, therefore, this Act applies. Section 3 of this Act provides that this Act applies to a Canadian judgment to the extent the judgment is within the scope of UFCMJRA Section 3. UFCMJRA Section 3(b)(3) provides that the UFCMJRA “does not apply to a foreign-country judgment . . . to the extent that the judgment is . . . a judgment for divorce, support, or maintenance, or other judgment rendered in connection with domestic relations.” The fact a judgment is a domestic relations judgment thus is a ground for denying recognition to the judgment under the UFCMJRA. Therefore, under subsection (b)(1) of this section, it also is a ground for vacating the registration of the judgment. In addition, under subsection (e) of this section, the court must enter a judgment denying recognition to the Canadian judgment, and the court’s judgment denying recognition will have the same effect as a judgment denying recognition to a foreign judgment under the UFCMJRA on the ground that the foreign judgment is not within the scope of the UFCMJRA. UFCMJRA Section 11 provides that the UFCMJRA “does not prevent the recognition under principles of comity or otherwise of a foreign-country judgment not within the scope” of the UFCMJRA. Thus, the judgment rendered by the court under subsection (e) would prevent Judgment Creditor from seeking recognition of the judgment under the UFCMJRA or registering the Canadian judgment under this Act, but would not prevent Judgment Creditor from seeking recognition of the judgment under principles of comity or other applicable law, such as, for example, the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (2008), if the Canadian judgment is one that fits within the scope of that Act.

        Subsection (b)(2) provides that a judgment debtor also may seek to have the registration vacated based on the failure of the person registering the judgment to comply with the requirements for registration under this Act. See Sections 4 and 6. While the subsection (b)(1) grounds for setting aside the registration relate to whether the Canadian judgment should be recognized at all (at least under the UFCMJRA), the subsection (b)(2) grounds for vacating the registration relate only to whether the person registering the judgment properly followed the registration process. For example, Section 4(a) requires that the person seeking recognition of a Canadian judgment through registration must do so for the purpose of enforcing the judgment. If recognition is sought solely for the preclusive effect of the judgment, then the registration procedure cannot be used. The judgment still may be entitled to recognition; the registration procedure simply is not the proper procedure by which to obtain that recognition. See Section 9(d)(2).
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-7-commentol15">
        U.S. courts consistently have held that a person opposing recognition may not seek to re-litigate the merits of the underlying case that lead to the judgment for which recognition is sought. Similarly, a person seeking to vacate registration of a Canadian judgment may not seek to relitigate the merits of the underlying case as a basis for vacating the registration.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-7-commentol16">
        Subsection (c) states that filing a petition to vacate the registration does not automatically stay enforcement of the registered judgment. Instead, in order to stay all enforcement activities until the petition to vacate the registration is determined (including those listed in Section 5(b) beyond the 30-day period), the person against whom the judgment was registered must request a stay of enforcement from the court under Section 8.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-7-commentol17">
        Subsection (d) states the effect of a court determination that the registration should be vacated – the registration is vacated, and any acts that have been taken under the registration to collect the judgment are void.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-7-commentol18">
        Subsection (e) provides that, if a registration is vacated on the basis that the Canadian judgment is not entitled to recognition on a ground upon which recognition would be denied under the UFCMJRA, then, in addition to vacating the registration, the court shall issue a judgment denying recognition to the Canadian judgment. As discussed in comment 3 above, the subsection (b)(1) grounds for vacating a registration are the same as the grounds for denying recognition to a Canadian judgment under the UFCMJRA. Therefore, if the court finds that one of those grounds exists, the result is not only that the registration is vacated, but also that recognition of the Canadian judgment is denied. Subsection (e) further provides that a judgment denying recognition on a subsection (b)(1) ground has the same effect as a judgment denying recognition on the same ground under the UFCMJRA.

        The standard to grant a stay pending determination of a petition to vacate a registration is a showing by the person requesting the stay of a likelihood of success on the merits with regard to one of the grounds for vacating a registration listed in Section 7(b). The grounds stated in Section 7(b) are the only grounds upon which a registration may be vacated; therefore, a showing of a likelihood of success with regard to one of these grounds provides the appropriate standard for staying enforcement activities pending the determination of a petition to vacate a registration.

        Subsection (a) states the relationship between this Act and the UFCMJRA. The conceptual approach in drafting this Act is to create a “module” that will “plug in” to the provisions of the UFCMJRA. This approach means that the provisions contained in the UFCMJRA need not be restated in this Act, as those provisions will apply equally to this Act. The only exception to this rule is Section 6 of the UFCMJRA. Unlike Section 6 of the UFCMJRA, this Act does not require that the person seeking recognition of a Canadian judgment file a court action. Therefore, Section 6 of the UFCMJRA does not apply to this Act. In providing for application of the rules of the UFCMJRA, the intent of this section is that all of those rules (other than Section 6) will apply, including not only substantive rules, but also other provisions, such as those dealing with allocation of burdens of proof and limitation of actions.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-9-commentol12">
        This Act is intended to provide an alternative procedure to the filing of an action under UFCMJRA Section 6 with regard to Canadian judgments. It does not prevent a person seeking recognition of a Canadian judgment from choosing to file an action seeking recognition as provided in UFCMJRA Section 6 rather than using this Act. The import of subsection (b) is that a person may seek recognition of a Canadian judgment either by registering it under this Act or by commencing a court action under Section 6 of the UFCMJRA. Cf. Revised Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (1964), Section 6 (dealing with registration of sister-state judgments) (“[t]he right of a judgment creditor to bring an action to enforce his judgment instead of proceeding under this Act remains unimpaired.”).
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-9-commentol13">
        Subsection (c) states the corollary to subsection (b) – a person must choose between the two means of seeking recognition of a Canadian judgment; both procedures may not be pursued at the same time against the same person with regard to the same judgment, or, in the case of a mixed judgment, the same portion of a judgment, in the same jurisdiction. To provide otherwise would lead to inefficiency and waste of judicial resources. Subsection (c), however, does not prevent a person from pursuing different procedures within this state for recognition of a judgment with regard to different persons obligated on the judgment. Subsection (c) also does not prevent the use of different procedures (registration or filing an action for recognition) in different states with regard to the same judgment or part of a judgment.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-9-commentol14">
        Subsection (c) is subject to the limited exception found in subsection (d). Under subsection (d), when a registration is vacated solely because of a failure to comply with a requirement for registration under this Act (see Section 7(b)(2)), the person whose registration was vacated is not precluded from further efforts to obtain recognition of the judgment. Instead, subsection (d) gives the person whose registration was vacated a choice – it may either file a new registration (assuming the defect in the previous registration is one that can be cured) or file an action under Section 6 of the UFCMJRA seeking recognition of the Canadian judgment.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c35s9-35-9-commentol15">
        Section 3 of this Act provides that the Act applies to a Canadian judgment that is within the scope of the UFCMJRA, if registration is sought for the purpose of enforcement. Thus, the registration procedure under this Act is available with regard to any Canadian judgment that could be considered for recognition through an action filed under the UFCMJRA, if the requirements for registration (including the requirement that recognition of the judgment through registration is being sought for the purpose of enforcing the judgment) are met. The corollary is that judgments not within the scope of the UFCMJRA are not within the scope of this Act. Those judgments continue to be recognized and enforced as they have been prior to this Act. Section 11 of the UFCMJRA states with regard to judgments not within its scope (and thus not within the scope of this Act) that they may be recognized “under principles of comity or otherwise.”

       The Canadian UEFJA does not apply to foreign judgments “rendered in proceedings commenced before the coming into force of [the] Act.” Canadian UEFJA § 3(f). This section places a comparable limitation on this Act. The Act applies only to a judgment entered in a proceeding commenced in Canada on or after the effective date of the Act. Thus, the critical date for determining whether this Act applies is the date the original proceeding that resulted in the Canadian judgment was commenced in the Canadian court.
