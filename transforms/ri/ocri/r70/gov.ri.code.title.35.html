Should a bank’s rating fall below “satisfactory”, the state shall have a reasonable amount of time to withdraw its funds. Preference will be given in the placement of state funds to those banks which have achieved a CRA rating of “outstanding”.

Laws § 36-5-7(a)(3), which exempted from veteran status those employees whose method and term of appointment were specified by statute, because the employee’s tenure at a public television station was not coterminous with the general manager’s incumbency.

        State employee entitled to veteran’s status under R.I. Gen. Laws § 36-5-7 was laid off. The Rhode Island Department of Administration (DOA) was obliged to place him in state employment, but not to restore back pay for the period before it knew he had been laid off, and his voluntary retirement relieved the DOA of the responsibility of finding him a new state job.

        State employee entitled to veteran’s status under R.I. Gen. Laws § 36-5-7 was laid off by a public television station. As he had falsely disclaimed being a veteran on his employment application, his waiver of claims arising from his layoff during the grievance process precluded his counterclaim against the station for the income he would have received while laid off.

        There is no authority, either express or implied, for the addition of prejudgment interest to back pay awarded under R.I. Gen. Laws § 35-5-7. Therefore, the doctrine of sovereign immunity insulates the State from paying prejudgment interest. R.I. Pub. Telcoms. Auth. v. Russell,

The federal government may be required by law, regulation, or agreement to pay interest to the state.

       The general assembly recognizes that the security of government computer systems is essential to ensuring the stability and integrity of vital information gathered and stored by the government for the benefit of the citizenry and the breach of security over computer systems presents a risk to the health, safety, and welfare of the public. It is the intent of the legislature to ensure that government computer systems and information residing on these systems are protected from unauthorized access, compromise, sabotage, hacking, viruses, destruction, illegal use, cyber attack, or any other act that might jeopardize or harm the computer systems and the information stored on them.

       In conjunction with the powers and duties outlined in this chapter, the office of internal audit may conduct reviews and assessments of the various government computer systems and the security systems established to safeguard these computer systems. Computer systems subject to this section shall include systems that pertain to federal, state, or local programs, and quasi-governmental bodies, and the computer systems of any entity or program that is subject to audit by the office of internal audit. The office of internal audit’s review may include an assessment of system vulnerability, network penetration, potential security breaches, and susceptibility to cyber attack and cyber fraud.

      <li id="t35c07s35-7-15ol1c">
       The office of internal audit’s findings shall be deemed public records and available for public inspection; provided, however, in the event the review indicates a computer system is vulnerable, or security over the system is otherwise deficient, reasonably segregable portions of the findings shall be subject to public inspection after the redaction of any information, the disclosure of which, would endanger the security of the system or reveal the specific nature of the vulnerabilities found. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the work papers developed in connection with the review of computer systems and the security over those systems authorized by this section shall not be deemed public records and are not subject to disclosure.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c07s35-7-15ol1d">
       In order to maintain the integrity of the computer system, the office of internal audit may procure the services of specialists in information security systems or other contractors deemed necessary in conducting reviews under this section, and in procuring those services shall be exempt from the requirements of the state purchasing law or regulation.

      Whenever the board is satisfied that any instrument or printed or written paper presented to it is in fact a valid bond or note of the state but it is so damaged that its condition is such as to hinder or prevent the owner or holder thereof from making good delivery of the bond or note, the board may, upon payment to it by the owner or holder thereof of such a sum as it deems necessary to cover the actual expense involved, cause the damage to be repaired or remedied by requiring the proper officers of the state to sign the bond or note in place of their damaged or destroyed signatures or those of their predecessors in office, to issue a duplicate bond or note, or to do whatever else the board may require of them to repair or remedy the damage. But no duplicate bond or note shall be so issued except upon the surrender of the original bond or note, which shall thereupon be cancelled forthwith, and the repaired or duplicate bond or note shall be treated in all respects as a valid obligation of the state. On every repaired or duplicate bond or note the general treasurer shall certify on the back thereof that the bond or note has been repaired or issued under the provisions of this section and the certification shall be conclusive proof that the bond or note has been repaired or issued in accordance with the requirements of the board and that it is a valid obligation of the state in accordance with its terms.

      Whenever the holder of any registered or coupon bond of this state which is now or shall hereafter be issued or outstanding shall desire to substitute the registered bond for a coupon bond, or the coupon bond for a registered bond, he or she shall present the coupon bond to the general treasurer with a request in writing for the substitution for the bond of one or more other bonds. The general treasurer, upon payment to him or her for the use of the state of such a sum as he or she deems necessary to cover the actual expense involved and under such regulations and restrictions as he or she may prescribe, is authorized and empowered to accept the bond so presented and to issue and deliver in substitution thereof one or more new bonds of denominations of one thousand dollars ($1,000), five thousand dollars ($5,000), ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or fifty thousand dollars ($50,000); provided, that the aggregate face value of the new bonds shall not exceed the face value of the bond so presented; provided, further, that if the new bonds bear coupons, the coupons shall cover only future interest payments. The new bonds shall in all substantial respect (except the denomination thereof) be similar to the bond so presented as to the date of maturity, interest rate, and dates of interest payments; and every new bond so issued in substitution shall be as valid for all purposes as the bond so presented for substitution, notwithstanding the fact that the number thereof or the signatures thereon or the denomination thereof may be different from the bond so presented for substitution. In every case the general treasurer shall mutilate the bond so presented for substitution and shall make a record of the date, number, and amount thereof, and of the date, number, and amount of every new bond issued in substitution. Thereafter the mutilated bond shall be kept in the files of the general treasurer or may be destroyed in the same manner as provided in § 35-8-2. Every new bond issued in substitution shall be signed by the general treasurer and by the secretary of state.

      <li id="t35c8.1s35-8.1-2ol11">
       State issued its general obligation bonds dated May 1, 1984, in the aggregate principal amount of thirty million dollars ($30,000,000) pursuant to statutory authorities approved by the electorate of the state, and the state issued its general obligation bonds dated June 28, 1985, in the aggregate principal amount of ninety million dollars ($90,000,000) pursuant to statutory authorities approved by the electorate of the state;

       1984 and 1985 bonds bear interest at a rate in excess of current interest rates and the general assembly has determined that it would be in the best interests of the people of the state to obtain funds to pay, redeem, or retire the 1984 and 1985 bonds with bonds bearing a lower rate of interest;

       Furthermore, the general assembly desires to consolidate debt issuing authorities and create administrative savings as a result of such consolidations. To accomplish this desire, on July 1, 1997, the public building authority shall be eliminated as an entity and its functions, powers, rights, duties and liabilities shall be transferred to the authority pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.

     <p>
      The authority shall have the right to acquire any land, or any interest therein, by the exercise of the power of eminent domain, whenever it shall be determined by the authority that the acquisition of the land, or interest, is necessary for the construction or the operation of any project.
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t35c8.1s35-8.1-8.3ol11">
       The necessity for an acquisition shall be conclusively presumed upon the adoption by the authority of a resolution declaring that the acquisition of the land, or interest therein, described in the resolution is necessary for the construction or operation. Within six (6) months thereafter the authority shall cause to be filed in the land evidence records of the city or town in which the land is located, a copy of the resolution of the authority, together with a plat of the land, or interest therein described, and a statement, signed by the chairperson of the authority, that the lands, or interest therein, are taken pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. Thereupon the authority shall file in the superior court in and for the county in which the land, or interest therein lies, a statement of the sum of money estimated by the authority to be just compensation for the land taken.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c8.1s35-8.1-8.3ol12">
       Upon the filing of the copy of the resolution, plat, and statement in the land evidence records of the city or town, the filing in the superior court, of the statement, and the depositing in the superior court, to the use of the persons entitled thereto, of such sum as the court shall determine to be amply sufficient to satisfy the claims of all persons interested in the land (and the court may, in its discretion, take evidence on the question to determine the sum to be deposited), title to the land, or interest therein, shall vest in the authority in fee simple absolute and the authority thereupon may take possession of the land, or interest therein.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c8.1s35-8.1-8.3ol13">
       No sum so paid into the court shall be charged with clerk’s fees of any nature. After the filing of the copy, plat, and statement, notice of the taking of the land, or interest therein, shall be served upon the owners of and persons having an estate in and interested in the land by the sheriff or his or her deputies of the county in which the land, or interest therein, lies, leaving a true and attested copy of the description and statement with each of the persons personally, or at their last and usual place of abode in this state with some person living there, and in the case any of the persons are absent from this state and have no last and usual place of abode therein occupied by any person, the copy shall be left with the persons, if any, in charge of or having possession of the land, or interest therein, taken of the absent persons if the same are known to the officer; and after the filing of the resolution, plat, and statement, the secretary of the authority shall cause a copy of the resolution and statement to be published in some newspaper published or having general circulation in the county where the land, or interest therein, may be located, at least once a week for three (3) successive weeks. If any person shall agree with the authority for the price of the land, or interest therein, so taken, the court upon the application of the parties in interest, may order that the sum agreed upon be paid forthwith from the money deposited, as the just compensation to be awarded in the proceeding.

       Any owner of or persons entitled to any estate in or interested in any part of the land, or interest therein, so taken, who cannot agree with the authority for the price of the land, or interest therein, so taken in which he or she is interested as aforesaid, may, within three (3) months after personal notice of the taking, or, if he or she have no personal notice, may within one year from the first publication of the copy of the resolution and statement, apply by petition to the superior court in and for the county in which the land, or interest therein, lies, setting forth the taking of his or her land or interest therein, and praying for an assessment of damages by a jury. Upon the filing of the petition the court shall cause twenty (20) days notice of the pendency thereof to be given to the authority by serving the chairperson or vice chairperson of the authority with a certified copy thereof, and may proceed after notice to the trial thereof; and the trial shall determine all questions of fact relating to the value of the land, or interest therein, and the amount thereof, and judgment shall be entered upon the verdict of the jury and execution shall be issued therefor against the money so deposited in court and in default thereof against any other property of the authority. In case two (2) or more conflicting petitioners make claim to the same land, or to any interests therein, or to different interests in the same parcel of land, the court upon motion shall consolidate their several petitions for trial at the same time by the same jury, and may frame all necessary issues for the trial thereof; and all proceedings taken pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall take precedence over all other civil matters then pending before the court, or if the superior court in and for the county in which the land, or interest therein, lies, be not in session in the county, then the trial may be heard in the superior court for the counties of Providence and Bristol.

       If any lands, or interests therein, in which any minor or other person not capable in law to act in his or her own behalf is interested, are taken by the authority under the provisions of this chapter, the superior court, upon the filing therein of any petition by or in behalf of the minor or other person, may appoint a guardian ad litem for the minor or other person, and the guardian may appear and be heard in behalf of the minor or other person; and the guardian may also, with the advice and consent of the superior court and upon the terms as said superior court may prescribe, release to the authority all claims for damages for the lands of the minor or other person or for any interests therein. Any lawfully appointed, qualified, and acting guardian or other fiduciary of the estate of any minor or other person, with the approval of the court of probate within this state having jurisdiction to authorize the sale of lands and properties within this state of any minor or other person, may, before the filing of any petition, agree with the authority upon the amount of damages suffered by the minor or other person by any taking of his or her lands or of his or her interests in any lands, and may, upon receiving the amount, release to the authority all claims of damages of the minor or other person for such taking.

       Whenever, from time to time the authority has satisfied the court that the amount deposited with the court is greater than is amply sufficient to satisfy the claims of all persons interested in the land, the court may order that the amount of any excess including any interest or increment on any sums so deposited shall be repaid to the authority. Whenever the authority has satisfied the court that the claims of all persons interested in the land taken have been satisfied, the unexpended balance, including any interest of increment on any sums so deposited, shall be paid forthwith to the authority.

       In any proceedings for the assessment of compensation and damages for land or interest therein taken or to be taken by eminent domain by the authority the following provisions shall be applicable:

        <li id="t35c8.1s35-8.1-8.3ol17-i">
         At any time during the pendency of the action or proceeding, the authority or an owner may apply to the court for an order directing an owner or the authority, as the case may be, to show cause why further proceedings should not be expedited, and the court may upon an application make an order requiring that the hearings proceed and that any other steps be taken with all possible expedition.
        </li>
        <li id="t35c8.1s35-8.1-8.3ol17-ii">
         If any of the land, or interest therein, is devoted to a public use, it may, nevertheless, be acquired, and the taking shall be effective provided that no land, or interest therein, belonging to a public utility corporation may be acquired without the approval of the public utilities administrator or other officer or tribunal having regulatory power over the corporation. Any land, or interest therein, already acquired by the authority may, nevertheless be included within the taking for the purpose of acquiring any outstanding interests in the land.

The principal of and the interest on the bonds shall be payable solely from the funds herein provided for the payment. The bonds of each issue pursuant to this subsection shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates as the authority shall determine, payable semi-annually, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding forty (40) years from their date or dates, as may be determined by the authority, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the authority, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the authority prior to the issuance of the bonds. The authority shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of the principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the state. The bonds shall be signed by the chairperson of the authority or shall bear his or her facsimile signature, and the official seal of the authority or a facsimile thereof shall be impressed or imprinted thereon and attested by the secretary of the authority, and any coupons attached to the bonds shall bear the facsimile signature of the chairperson of the authority. In case any officer whose signature or facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be an officer before the delivery of the bonds, the signature or the facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and, sufficient for all purposes, the same as if he or she had remained in office until the delivery. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the authority may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest and for the interchange of registered and coupon bonds. The authority may sell such bonds in such manner, either at public or private sale, and for such price, as it may determine will best effect the purposes of this chapter.

The proceeds of bonds or notes issued for the purpose of refunding outstanding bonds or notes may be applied, in the discretion of the authority, to the purchase, retirement at maturity, or redemption of the outstanding bonds or notes either on their earliest or a subsequent redemption date, and may, pending the application, be placed in escrow. Any escrowed proceeds may be invested and reinvested in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, or in certificates of deposit, time deposits, or repurchase agreements fully secured or guaranteed by the state or the United States, or an instrumentality of either, maturing at such time or times as shall be appropriate to assure the prompt payment, as to principal, interest, and redemption premium, if any, of the outstanding bonds and notes to be so refunded. The interest, income and profits, if any, earned or realized on any investment may also be applied to the payment of the outstanding bonds or notes to be so refunded. After the terms of the escrow have been fully satisfied and carried out, any balance of the proceeds and interest, income and profits, if any, earned or realized on the investments thereof may be returned to the authority for use by it in furtherance of its purposes. The issuance of the bonds, the maturities and other details thereof, the rights of the holders thereof, and the rights, duties, and obligations of the authority in respect of the same shall be governed by the provisions of this chapter insofar as the same may be applicable.

      The following act as passed by the general assembly in June, 1823, and amended in June, 1827, and June, 1834, and subsequently amended, shall continue in force:
     </p>
     <p>
      “Whereas, it has been made to appear to this general assembly, upon the representation of Titus Weeks, Esq., executor of the last will and testament of Abraham Touro, Esq., of the city of Boston, in the state of Massachusetts, that the said Abraham by his last will bequeathed a legacy in the following words, viz.: ‘Item. — I give ten thousand dollars ($10,000) to the legislature of the state of Rhode Island for the purpose of supporting the Jewish synagogue in that state; in special trust to be appropriated to that object in such manner as the said legislature, together with the municipal authority of the town of Newport, may from time to time direct and appoint’:
     </p>
     <p>
      “Therefore,
     </p>
     <p>
      “§ 1.
      Be it enacted by the general assembly, and by the authority thereof it is enacted, That said legacy and trust be and hereby are accepted by the general assembly; and the general treasurer is authorized and directed to apply for and receive from said executor the said legacy or donation of ten thousand dollars ($10,000), to give all proper receipts and acquittances therefor upon receipt thereof, and as soon as possible to vest the same entire in the stocks of some substantial bank or banks, or in some of the United States stocks; and thereafter cause the same to be invested by the state investment commission in accordance with the prudent investor rule and the certificates or evidences of such stock shall be carefully kept by said general treasurer in his or her office or by a custodian. It shall be the duty of said general treasurer once in every year to report to the general assembly the state of said fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      “§ 2.
      And be it further enacted, that the city council of Newport may, and it shall be their duty to cause all repairs to be made, which in their opinions shall be necessary and proper, upon said Jewish synagogue, upon the walls enclosing the Jewish burying ground in Newport appertaining to the synagogue, and thereafter, so far as funds may be available, to apply the same toward the maintenance of that part of the synagogue premises known as the community building and to pay such other expenses as said city council may deem necessary and proper, the total expenditures herein authorized, however, not to exceed in any twelve (12) month period, four and one-half percent (41/2%) of the value of the Abraham Touro fund as measured on March 31 of each such period; provided, that all said expenditures shall be first approved by the president or vice president and by the secretary or treasurer of the board of officers of the Congregation Jeshuat Israel, worshiping in said synagogue, and by any one (1) of the trustees selected by said congregation under the provisions of § 7 of this act; and whenever there shall be no person of the Jewish persuasion residing in Newport and qualified and authorized to have the care and superintendence of said synagogue, said council shall appoint some suitable person or persons for that purpose, with such compensation as said council with the approbation of the general assembly, shall think reasonable; and provided, further, that nothing in this act shall be construed to authorize said city council or any other person whatever in any manner to interfere with or restrain the full and free exercise of the Jewish religion in said synagogue by any individual of that faith residing in Newport, or to interrupt the possession, control and management with which the proprietors of said synagogue and premises, or any other persons according to the laws and customs of the Jews, may be vested.
     </p>
     <p>
      “§ 3.
      And be it further enacted, that it shall be the duty of said city council, from time to time as occasion shall present, to recommend to the general assembly such measures and provisions as in their opinion shall be best calculated to promote and fulfill the object and intention of the donor, the said Touro, as expressed in his said will, in supporting and advancing said Jewish institution.
     </p>
     <p>
      “§ 4.
      And be it further enacted that the city council of Newport be, and they are hereby authorized from time to time, as occasion may require, to draw on the general treasurer in each twelve (12) month period, an amount not to exceed in any such period four and one half percent (41/2%) of the value of the Abraham Touro fund as measured on March 31 of each such period, to pay for the expenditures authorized under § 2 hereof, and that said council shall make detailed report of their expenditures to the general assembly annually at the January session.
     </p>
     <p>
      “§ 5.
      The state investment commission shall have the care and management of this fund, with full power to regulate the custody and safekeeping of all moneys and evidences of property belonging thereto; it shall invest, subject to its order, to the use of this fund, all dividends, interest, or income arising therefrom in accordance with the prudent investor rule, and it may sell and dispose of any or all of such investments so made, when necessary to meet the draft of the city council of Newport as provided in § 4 of this act.
     </p>
     <p>
      “§ 6.
      The general treasurer is authorized and directed to expend the sum of five thousand dollars ($5,000) out of the Abraham Touro fund towards the purchase of a parcel of land in the city of Newport and the construction of a building and other improvements thereon to be used in connection with the Jewish synagogue in said city.
     </p>
     <p>
      “§ 7.
      The title to the said premises and the improvements thereon shall be vested in five (5) trustees, consisting of the general treasurer of the state of Rhode Island, the mayor of the city of Newport, and three (3) other persons to be selected by the Congregation Jeshuat Israel, a religious and educational corporation created under the laws of the state of Rhode Island, and now worshiping in said synagogue.
     </p>
     <p>
      “§ 8.
      The selection of the trustees set forth in § 7 shall be subject to the approval of the superior court of the state of Rhode Island, and they shall hold the said premises for all time hereafter in accordance with the provisions, objects and purposes expressed in the said last will and testament of said Abraham Touro, deceased.
     </p>
     <p>
      “§ 9.
      The trustees selected from time to time as set forth in § 7 and approved by the superior court of the state of Rhode Island, as provided for in § 8, shall have power at any and all times, for the purpose of obtaining money with which to pay for the construction of a building and other improvements provided for in § 6, to mortgage the parcel of land purchased under the provisions of said section together with any building or buildings and other improvements that may be constructed thereon and to sign all deeds, notes or other instruments which may be necessary to effect the mortgage of the same.
     </p>
     <p>
      “§ 10.
      Notwithstanding any provision of chapter 9 of title 35 to the contrary, on or after July 1, 1995, the president or vice president and the secretary or the treasurer of the board of officers of the Congregation Jeshuat Israel worshipping in said synagogue are hereby authorized from time to time, as occasion may require, to draw on the general treasurer in each twelve (12) month period, an amount not to exceed in any such period four and one-half percent (41/2%) of the value of the Abraham Touro fund as measured on March 31 of each such period to pay for expenditures authorized by said Congregation in conformance with its charter and bylaws, without the necessity of first obtaining the approval of the city council of Newport. The aforementioned officers of the Congregation shall annually make a detailed report of said expenditures to the city council of Newport.”

      “Whereas, it has been made to appear to this general assembly that Judah Touro, formerly of New Orleans, deceased, made in his will the following bequest: ‘I give and bequeath ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for the purpose of paying the salary of a reader or minister to officiate in the Jewish synagogue of Newport, Rhode Island, and to endow the ministry of the same, as well as to keep in repair and embellish the Jewish cemetery in Newport aforesaid, the said amount to be appropriated and paid or invested for that purpose in such manner as my executors may determine concurrently with the corporation of Newport aforesaid, if necessary; and it is my wish and desire that David J. Gould and Nathan H. Gould, sons of my esteemed friend, the late Isaac Gould, Esq., of Newport aforesaid, should continue to oversee the improvements in said cemetery and direct the same,’ and that said city of Newport accepted said bequest and that the said money was paid by the said executors to the persons authorized by said city to receive it, and the same, with accumulations, now stands invested in the name or in the hands of certain trustees of the Judah Touro ministerial fund, appointed by said city. And whereas it is desired that said city shall be expressly authorized to hold said trust property and perform the trusts thereof: Therefore,
     </p>
     <p>
      “It is enacted by the general assembly as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      “§ 1.
      The said city of Newport, by its city council, is hereby empowered to demand, recover and receipt for and take and hold the property aforesaid, and to invest and keep invested the same in its name upon the trusts aforesaid, and to use and apply the same to and for the said trusts, with power to appoint and employ such officers and agents as may be needful or desirable for the care of said property and the proper performance of said trusts.”

      Consistent with the investment criteria set forth in §§ 35-10-6, 35-10-11, and 35-10-12, the commission is specifically authorized to invest state funds or pension funds in investments which are intended to retain or create jobs in the New England region, but with priority given among the investments to the retention and creation of jobs in the state of Rhode Island. Notwithstanding the investment limitations set forth in §§ 35-10-6 and 35-10-11, the commission may in any particular case prescribe the following variations in these investment limitations when it shall deem it appropriate in view of the exigencies of the case and in order to carry out the intent and purpose of this section: (1) direct or indirect mortgage or collateral loans for projects or businesses; or (2) direct or equity interests in real estate, projects, or businesses; provided, that the total amount of all these loans or investments do not exceed at the time of making the loan and/or investment five percent (5%) of the total funds which are under the jurisdiction of the commission and which are subject to its statement of investment objectives and guidelines; and further provided, that investments made under this section shall be made in accordance with the prudent person standard set forth in this chapter.

       Notwithstanding any general or special law or regulation to the contrary, the general treasurer, acting as the treasurer/custodian of the state employees’ retirement system and the teachers’ retirement system, and as the chairperson of the state investment commission, is authorized and directed to monitor, by reference to reports of the investor responsibility research center or such other sources as he or she may deem useful and appropriate, the extent to which corporations organized under the laws of the United States or the several states and operating in Northern Ireland, in which the assets of the retirement systems or of the pension reserves investment trust fund are invested, adhere to principals of nondiscrimination in employment and freedom of workplace opportunity. In conducting the survey, the general treasurer may utilize any information presently available relative to similar pension plans. In making this determination, the general treasurer shall consider, without limitation, the following standards for corporate activity:
       <ol>
        <li id="t35c10s35-10-14ol1a1">
         Equal access to employment, promotion, and job-preservation without regard to religious affiliation or other minority status;

       The general treasurer shall set forth the results of the investigation by filing a report with the clerks of the house of representatives and of the senate not later than December 31 of each year. The report shall include, but not be limited to, the names and addresses of all United States corporations operating in Northern Ireland in which the assets of the retirement systems or trust fund are invested, and the findings of the general treasurer relative to these corporations’ adherence to the standards for corporate activity as set forth in subsection (a). The general treasurer shall also report his or her recommendations, if any, consistent with prudent fiduciary practice, based upon the findings of the investigation. The report shall be available for public inspection in the offices of the clerks of the house of representatives and of the senate, and in the office of the general treasurer.

       The general treasurer, subject to the approval of the commission, shall, where necessary, appropriate, and consistent with prudent standards for fiduciary practice, support shareholder petitions or initiatives requiring corporate action in compliance with the standards for nondiscrimination set forth in this section.

       It is not the intent of this section to diminish the present portfolio and it is not the intent of this section to injure the fragile economy of Northern Ireland. The general treasurer, in accordance with sound investment criteria, is encouraged to make future pension fund investments in United States firms which conduct business in Northern Ireland and which abide by the MacBride Principles of fair employment. Should all or any of the United States firms in which Rhode Island state pension funds are invested refuse to comply with the MacBride Principles, the general treasurer, in accordance with sound investment criteria, does have the option and is encouraged to remove these funds and invest them in United States firms which conduct business in Northern Ireland and which abide by the MacBride Principles of fair employment.

      The purpose of this chapter is to enable eligible governmental entities to participate with the state in providing maximum opportunities for the investment of public funds consistent with safety and protection of such funds. It is the intention of the general assembly in enabling the general treasurer with the approval of the state investment commission to establish the said investment pools, that the general treasurer and state investment commission consider the importance of retaining deposits with the banks located and operating within the state, that further consideration be given to a bank’s commitment to the various communities within the state, the bank’s role as an employer within the state, as well as the bank’s commitment to the growth of economic development within the state.

       The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously for an additional embargo on Iranian arms exports, which is a freeze on assets abroad of an expanded list of individuals and companies involved in Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs and further, calls for nations and institutions to bar new grants or loans to Iran except for humanitarian and developmental purposes; and

       All United States and foreign entities that have invested more than twenty million dollars ($20,000,000) in Iran’s energy sector since August 5, 1996, are subject to sanctions under United States law pursuant to the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996; and

Furthermore, the law authorizes state and local governments to divest public assets from, or prohibit public investment in, certain investment activities in Iran; and

     <p>
      The purpose of this chapter is to authorize and implement a system of financial planning which would allow the university of Rhode Island (the “university”) to more accurately match revenues and expenditures for externally funded research programs for each fiscal year. The general assembly has found and hereby declares that it is in the public interest to encourage independent research activity at the university and further that it is essential to the financial well being of the state and the university that revenues from externally funded research programs be allocated to the fiscal years in which they accrue and be matched to the expenditures for the programs that are incurred for that fiscal year. The general assembly has further found that under the present system revenues are often received after the close of the fiscal year although the expenditures to which they are matched were incurred prior to the close of the fiscal year, and that, in fact, under certain programs, funds must be expended and then reimbursement sought from the contracting agency at a later date, often after the close of the fiscal year.

       The code provides that interest with respect to certain obligations may not be exempt from federal income taxation unless they are in registered form. It is therefore a matter of state concern that public entities be authorized to provide for the issuance of obligations in registered form. It is a purpose of this chapter to empower all public entities to establish and maintain a system pursuant to which obligations may be issued in registered form within the meaning of the applicable provisions of the code.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c13s35-13-3ol1b">
       Obligations have traditionally been issued in bearer rather than in registered form, and a change from bearer to registered form may affect the relationships, rights, and duties of issuers of and the persons that deal with obligations, and by this effect, the costs. These effects will impact the various issuers and varieties of obligations differently depending on their legal and financial characteristics, their markets, and their adaptability to recent and prospective technological and organizational developments. It is therefore a matter of state concern that public entities be provided flexibility in the development of systems of registration and control over system incidents, so as to accommodate these differing impacts. It is a purpose of this chapter to empower the establishment and maintenance, and amendment from time to time, of differing systems of registration of obligations, including system incidents, so as to accommodate the differing impacts upon issuers and varieties of obligations. It is further a purpose of this chapter to authorize systems that will facilitate the prompt and accurate transfer of registered public obligations and the developing of practices with regard to the registration and transfer of registered public obligations.

       Each issuer is authorized to establish and maintain a system of registration with respect to each obligation which it issues. The system may be a system pursuant to which (1) only certificated registered public obligations are issued; (2) only uncertificated registered public obligations are issued; or (3) both certificated and uncertificated registered public obligations are issued. The issuer may amend, discontinue, and reinstitute any system, from time to time, subject to covenants.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c13s35-13-4ol1b">
       The system shall be established, amended, discontinued, or reinstituted for the issuer and shall be maintained for the issuer as provided by the official or official body.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c13s35-13-4ol1c">
       The system shall be described in the registered public obligation or in the official actions which provide for original issuance of the registered public obligation, and in subsequent official actions providing for amendments and other matters from time to time. The description may be by reference to a program of the issuer which is established by the official or official body.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c13s35-13-4ol1d">
       The system shall define the method or methods by which transfer of the registered public obligation shall be effective with respect to the issuer, and by which payment of principal and any interest shall be made. The system may permit the issuance of registered public obligations in any denomination to represent several registered public obligations of smaller denominations. The system may also provide for the form of any certificated registered public obligation or of any writing relating to an uncertificated registered public obligation, for identifying numbers or other designations, for a sufficient supply of certificates for subsequent transfers, for record and payment dates, for varying denominations, for communications to holders or owners of obligations, and for accounting, cancelled certificate destruction registration, and releases of security interests and for other incidental matters. Unless the issuer otherwise provides, the record date for interest payable on the first or fifteenth day of a month shall be the fifteenth day or the last business day of the preceding month, respectively, and for interest payable on other than the first or fifteenth day of a month shall be the fifteenth calendar day before the interest payment date.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c13s35-13-4ol1e">
       Under a system pursuant to which both certificated and uncertificated registered public obligations are issued, both types of registered public obligations may be regularly issued, or one type may be regularly issued and the other type issued only under described circumstances or to particular described categories of owners, and provision may be made for registration and release of security interests in registered public obligations.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c13s35-13-4ol1f">
       The system may include covenants of the issuer as to amendments, discontinuances, and reinstitutions of the system and the effect of these on the exemption of interest from the income tax provided for by the code.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c13s35-13-4ol1g">
       Whenever an issuer shall issue an uncertificated registered public obligation, the system of registration may provide that a true copy of the official actions of the issuer relating to the uncertificated registered public obligation be maintained by the issuer or by the person, if any, maintaining the system on behalf of the issuer, so long as the uncertificated registered public obligation remains outstanding and unpaid. A copy of the official actions, verified to be a copy by an authorized officer, shall be admissible before any court of record, administrative body, or arbitration panel without further authentication.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c13s35-13-4ol1h">
       Nothing in this chapter shall preclude a conversion from one of the forms of registered public obligations provided for by this chapter to a form of obligation not provided for by this chapter if interest on the obligation so converted will continue to be exempt from the income tax provided for by the code.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c13s35-13-4ol1i">
       The rights provided by other laws with respect to obligations in forms not provided for by this chapter shall, to the extent not inconsistent with this chapter, apply with respect to registered public obligations issued in forms authorized by this chapter.

     <p>
      It is declared that, for the benefit of the people of the state, the conduct and increase of their commerce, the protection and enhancement of their welfare, the development of continued prosperity, and the improvement of their health and living conditions, it is essential that this and future generations be given the fullest opportunity to learn and to develop their intellectual skills and be given the fullest access to affordable housing. In order to achieve these ends it is important that Rhode Island citizens be provided with an investment opportunity to enhance their financial access to institutions of higher education and access to housing within this state. It is the intent of the general assembly to provide the people of the state with an alternative method of saving for the purpose of encouraging enrollment in institutions of higher education and for the purpose of encouraging the purchase of residential dwellings within the state.

      In order to provide the people of the state: (1) with access to institutions of higher education; and (2) the financial means to purchase residential housing; there shall be issued with all bonds of the state, authorized by the provisions of the general obligation bond acts, savings bonds in such amounts as determined by the general treasurer with the approval of the governor. Bonds to be issued and sold as savings bonds shall be designated by the governor and the general treasurer as “general obligation savings bonds” in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the bonds, and shall be subject to all of the terms and provisions of the general obligation bond acts, except as provided in §§ 35-15-5 and 35-15-6 and except that savings bonds may bear interest payable at such time or times, and may be sold in such a manner, and as may be determined by the governor and the general treasurer. Savings bonds may be sold at a negotiated sale if the governor and general treasurer determine that a negotiated sale will result in either a more efficient and economic sale of the savings bonds or greater access to the savings bonds by residents in the state. If any savings bonds are sold at a negotiated sale, the underwriter or underwriters to which the bonds are sold shall, in the judgment of the general treasurer, have sufficient capability to make a broad distribution of the bonds to investors resident in the state. The aggregate original principal amount of the bonds will be the sole and exclusive test for determining whether general obligation bonds have been issued in the amounts approved by the vote of the people in the general obligation bond acts. In making these determinations, the interest component of the savings bonds shall be disregarded.

Any such agreement shall provide that it may be canceled at any time, but the agreement may include provisions for a reasonable brief period of notice for cancellation.

       No person making any payment by credit card shall be relieved from liability for the underlying obligation except to the extent that the state realizes final payment of the underlying obligation in cash or the equivalent. If final payment is not made by the credit card issuer or other guarantor of payment in the credit card transaction, then the underlying obligation shall survive and the state shall retain all remedies for enforcement which would have applied if the credit card transaction had not occurred. No contract may modify the provisions of this subsection. This subsection, however, shall not make the underlying obligor liable for any discount or administrative fees paid to the credit card issuer or other party by the state, except with child support payments. Credit cards shall only be accepted for child support payments if a means is established to ensure that the full amount of the child support payment made by credit card is received by the recipient and that state revenue is not used to pay any fee charged by the credit card company for the child support payment.

       A state officer or employee who accepts a credit card payment in accordance with this section and any applicable procedures, policies, rules, or regulations of the state shall not thereby incur any personal liability for the final collection of such payments.

       This section shall be broadly construed to authorize, but not require, acceptance of credit card payments by authorized departments or agencies.

      It is the policy of the State of Rhode Island (the “State”) that in order to maintain an effective system of monitoring the use of federal subsidies within the state, facilities within the state proposed to be financed with bonds issued by an issuer that does not have jurisdiction over the location of those facilities including, but not limited to, issuers located outside of the state, must receive prior host approval from the governor of the state in accordance with this act.
