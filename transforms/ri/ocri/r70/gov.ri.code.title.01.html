       Declaration of policy.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      It is found and declared that an airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of the airport and of occupants of land and other persons in its vicinity and also, if of the obstruction type, in effect reduces the size of the area available for the landing, taking off, and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the airport and the public investment in the airport. Accordingly, it is declared:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t01c03s1-3-3ol11">
       That the creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public nuisance and an injury to the community served by the airport in question.
      </li>
      <li id="t01c03s1-3-3ol12">
       That it is necessary in the interest of the public health, safety, and general welfare that the creation or establishment of airport hazards be prevented.
      </li>
      <li id="t01c03s1-3-3ol13">
       That this should be accomplished, to the extent legally by proper exercise of the police power, without compensation.
      </li>
      <li id="t01c03s1-3-3ol14">
       That the prevention of the creation or establishment of airport hazards, and the elimination, removal, alteration, mitigation, or marking and lighting of existing airport hazards, are public purposes for which the state and its political subdivisions may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or property interests.
      </li>
      <li id="t01c03s1-3-3ol15">
       That any obstructions to the use of navigable airspace destroy and impair the safe use of such airspace thereby endangering aircraft and are not in the interest of public health, public safety, or general welfare.

       Airport approach plans.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The airport corporation shall formulate, adopt, and revise, when necessary for planning, an airport airspace plan for each publicly owned airport in the state. Each plan shall indicate the circumstances under which structures and trees are, or would be, airport hazards; the area within which measures for the protection of the airport’s navigable airspace, including aerial approaches, should be taken; and what the height limits and other objectives of those measures should be. In adopting or revising any airspace plan, the airport corporation shall consider, among other things, the character of flying operations expected to be conducted at the airport; the traffic pattern and regulations affecting flying operations at the airport; the nature of the terrain; the height of existing structures and trees above the level of the airport; and the possibility of lowering or removing existing obstructions. The airport corporation may obtain and consider the views of the agency of the federal government charged with the fostering of civil aeronautics as to the aerial approaches and other regulated airspace necessary to safe flying operations at the airport.

       Where advisable to facilitate the enforcement of zoning regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter, any political subdivision in which an airport or airport hazard area is located shall establish a system for the granting of permits to establish or construct new structures and other uses and to replace existing structures and other uses or to make substantial changes or substantial repairs.
       <p id="t01c03s1-3-14ol1a.1">
        Each person seeking a permit to construct or alter a structure within an airport hazard area under this section shall file a form 7460-1 with the federal aviation administration, (FAA), as required under part 77. Furthermore, each person shall file a copy of the form 7460-1 and the FAA part 77 determination with the airport corporation and with the political subdivision or joint zoning board. A political subdivision or joint zoning board shall consider the FAA part 77 determination before granting any permit.

      <li id="t01c03s1-3-14ol1b">
       Before any nonconforming structure or tree may be replaced, substantially altered or repaired, rebuilt, allowed to grow higher, or replanted, a permit must be secured from the administrative agency authorized by the political subdivision to administer and enforce the regulations, authorizing the replacement, change, or repair. No permit shall be granted that would allow the structure or tree in question to be made higher or become a greater obstruction and/or hazard to air navigation than it was when the applicable regulation was adopted. Whenever the administrative agency authorized by the political subdivision determines that a nonconforming structure has been abandoned or more than eighty percent (80%) torn down, destroyed, deteriorated, or decayed:
       <ol>
        <li id="t01c03s1-3-14ol1b1">
         No permit shall be granted that would allow the structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit established by the airport’s airspace plan or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations;
        </li>
        <li id="t01c03s1-3-14ol1b2">
         Whether application is made for a permit under this section or not, the administrative agency authorized by the political subdivision may by appropriate action compel the owner of the nonconforming structure or tree, at his or her own expense, to lower, remove, reconstruct, or equip the object as may be necessary to conform to the regulations or, if the owner of the nonconforming structure or tree fails to comply with the order for ten (10) days after notice, the agency may proceed to have the object so lowered, removed, reconstructed, or equipped and assess the cost and expense upon the owner of object or the land where it is or was located.

       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t01c03s1-3-14ol1c">
       Unless an assessment is paid within ninety (90) days from the service of notice on the agent or owner of the object or land, the sum shall bear interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum until paid, and shall be collected in the same manner as are general taxes.

     <p>
      Whenever any aircraft is used, operated, or caused to be operated in this state and an action is begun to recover damages for injuries arising to the person or to the property or for the death of a person, arising out of an accident or collision in which that aircraft was involved, or arising out of an accident caused by the dropping or falling of any object from that aircraft, evidence that at the time of the accident or collision it was registered in the name of the defendant as owner is prima facie evidence that it was then being operated by and under the control of a person for whose conduct the defendant was wholly responsible, and absence of that responsibility is an affirmative defense to be set up in the answer and proved by the defendant.

       All owners and operators, or owners or operators, of all aircraft, and dealers in aircraft, based or primarily used in the state of Rhode Island shall register the federal certificates of their aircraft and dealer registration as the director may by regulation prescribe. An aircraft shall be deemed to be based or primarily used in the state when in the normal course of its use, according to airport records, it leaves from and returns to or remains at one or more points within the state more often or longer than at any other single location outside of the state. Nonresidents may operate noncommercially within this state as an owner and operator, or owner or operator, or as a dealer, without that registration for not more than ninety (90) days in any calendar year. To operate commercially intrastate, nonresidents shall register.
      </li>

       Subject to the limitations of subsections (d) and (f), every person who operates an aircraft shall register the federal aircraft certificate of that aircraft with the chief aeronautics inspector during each period in which the aircraft is operated within this state in accordance with subsection (a). The annual fee for each registration, and for each registration renewal, is as follows: Aircraft weighing less than two thousand (2,000) pounds, thirty dollars ($30.00); two thousand and one (2,001) to three thousand (3,000) pounds, sixty dollars ($60.00); three thousand and one (3,001) to four thousand five hundred (4,500) pounds, one hundred ten dollars ($110); four thousand five hundred and one (4,501) to twelve thousand five hundred (12,500) pounds, one hundred sixty dollars ($160); over twelve thousand five hundred pounds (12,500), two hundred fifty dollars ($250). For the purpose of the annual fee, the weight considered will be the gross weight as published by the manufacturer. Every person who is a dealer in aircraft shall register his or her federal dealer’s aircraft registration certificate with the chief aeronautics inspector. The annual fee for registration of each federal dealer’s aircraft registration certificate is fifty dollars ($50.00) and for each aircraft in the possession operated solely for the purpose of sale or demonstration is twenty-five dollars ($25.00). Any person who engages in a business, a substantial portion of which consists of the manufacturing, selling, or exchanging of aircraft, and who does not have a federal dealer’s certificate shall register all aircraft owned by the person and operated within the state with the chief aeronautics inspector and pay the annual fee for that aircraft provided for in this subsection and is not eligible to pay the limited fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for all aircraft operated solely for the purpose of sale or demonstration.
      </li>
      <li id="t01c04s1-4-6ol1c">
       All fees are in lieu of all personal property taxes on aircraft authorized by any law or ordinance. Registration certificates issued after expiration of the first six (6) months of the annual registration period, as prescribed by the director, are issued at the rate of fifty percent (50%) of the annual fee.

        Rhode Island Airport Corporation’s (RIAC) authority to issue orders “requiring or prohibiting certain things to be done” is not limited to generally applicable aeronautical regulation; thus, an order issued by RIAC’s director under R.I. Gen. Laws § 1-4-15 is the exclusive means of permanently barring an individual from entering onto an airport in RIAC’s jurisdiction. Blais v. R.I. Airport Corp.,

        Communications from the Rhode Island Airport Corporation (RIAC) purporting to ban an individual from an airport did not meet statutory requirements because (1) a no-trespass letter did not suffice, as a formal order in accordance with R.I. Gen. Laws § 1-4-15 was required, the letter did not state reasons, modification requirements, or a statutory basis, the RIAC’s director did not sign the letter, and the letter did not hold itself out as a formal order; and (2) a subsequent order only extended the letter and did not satisfy the procedural requirements of the Uniform Aeronautical Regulatory Act, as the order did not state “the requirements to be met before approval is given or the . . . order shall be modified or changed”.

     </h3>
     <p>
      There is imposed on all transient parking in the district a surcharge in an amount equal to five percent (5%) of transient parking receipts. The surcharge shall be collected by the operator of each facility providing transient parking in the district and remitted by the operator to the tax administrator not later than the twentieth (20th) day of the month following the calendar month in which the transient parking was provided. The tax administrator may require the filing of any forms with any information that the tax administrator may reasonably determine is necessary to carry out the provisions of this statute. The surcharges collected by the tax administrator under this section shall be deposited upon receipt in a special account, denominated as the Warwick airport parking district account. At annual or more frequent intervals, amounts accumulated in the Warwick airport parking district account shall be remitted to the treasurer of the city of Warwick to be held as part of the general fund of the city of Warwick.

       Every person desiring to provide transient parking in the district shall file with the tax administrator an application for a permit for each place of business where transient parking will be provided. The application shall be in a form, include information, and bear any signatures that the tax administrator may require. There shall be no fee for this permit. Every permit issued under this chapter shall expire on June 30 of each year. Every permit holder desiring to renew a permit shall annually, on or before February 1 of each year, apply for renewal of its permit. The renewal permit shall be valid for the period of July 1 of that calendar year through June 30 of the subsequent calendar year, unless sooner canceled, suspended, or revoked. Upon receipt of the required application, the tax administrator shall issue to the applicant a permit. Provided, that if the applicant, at the time of making the application, owes any fee, surcharge, penalty, or interest imposed under the authority of this chapter, the applicant shall pay the amount owed.

The notice may be served personally or by mail.

       The superior court of this state has jurisdiction to restrain and enjoin any person from engaging in business as an operator of a transient parking facility in the district without a parking operator’s permit or permits or after a transient parking facility operator’s permit has been suspended or revoked. The tax administrator may institute proceedings to prevent and restrain violations of this chapter. In any proceeding instituted under this section, proof that a person continues to operate a transient parking facility from the location to which a revoked parking operator’s permit was assigned, is prima facie evidence that the person is engaging in business as a parking operator without a parking operator’s permit.

If it appears that the administrator is entitled to a greater amount of fees, surcharges, interest, and penalties than assessed or determined by the tax administrator and paid by the petitioner, the court shall order the payment by the petitioner of an additional amount as the court determines, and the petitioner shall immediately pay that amount to the tax administrator.

The process may be served by leaving a copy of the process in the hands of the director of business regulation or in the director’s office with someone in charge of the office. The service is sufficient service upon the person; provided, that notice of the service and a copy of the process, at least fifteen (15) days before the return day of the process, is sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, by the tax administrator or the tax administrator’s attorney of record, to the person’s last known address, and the sender’s registered or certified mail receipt of sending and the tax administrator’s or the administrator’s attorney’s affidavit of compliance are appended to the process and entered with the declaration. Service of process in the manner provided for in this section, under the circumstances specified in this section, is of the same force and validity as if served upon the operator personally within this state. Nothing in this section limits or affects the right to serve process upon a person not a resident of this state within this state in any other manner now or hereafter permitted by law.
