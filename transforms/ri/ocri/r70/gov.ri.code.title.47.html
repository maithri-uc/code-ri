       The director of the department of labor and training shall, in any town or city without a town or city sealer, or in a case where a sealer is not available or his or her deputy, or when sufficient equipment has not been provided for by the town or city for a sealer to properly perform his or her duties, for a period not to exceed three (3) months in any one year, test and/or approve any weighing, measuring, or balancing apparatus, and shall receive compensation for testing and/or approving as stated herein. Every mechanical, electronic, or other scale with NETP certification with a capacity of less than thirty-five (35) pounds a fee of twelve dollars ($12.00); for every scale used for the retail sale of precious metals thirty dollars ($30.00); for every mechanical, electronic, or other scale with NETP certification with a capacity of thirty-five (35) pounds to three hundred (300) pounds a fee of thirty dollars ($30.00); for every platform scale with a capacity of three hundred (300) pounds to five thousand (5,000) pounds a fee of twenty-four dollars ($24.00); and for every platform scale with a capacity over five thousand (5,000) pounds a fee of thirty-six dollars ($36.00) per hour. If any of the scales, balances or gasoline measuring devices with NETP certification are found to be incorrect, then they shall be so marked and their use forbidden until such time as the devices meet the requirements of that current year edition of NIST Handbook 44. Scales or balances not meeting class standards, as those often used to weigh people or scales for approximating weight, can be checked and the fees shall be the same as herein provided for same weight capacities. For the testing and/or approving of gasoline measuring devices there shall be a fee of eighteen dollars ($18.00) per test per meter; in the case of a multi-grade dispenser a fee of twelve dollars ($12.00) shall be charged to verify the price computation mechanism.
