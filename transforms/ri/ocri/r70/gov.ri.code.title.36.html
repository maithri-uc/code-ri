       Whereas the legislature in the January 1951 session established a department of administration and in article II thereof created a “merit system of personnel administration” and a division of personnel administration within the department, it is apparent the intent was to establish an organization which would be more effective in securing qualified personnel for the classified service of the state than had been the case under the civil service department as created in chapter 661 of the Public Laws of 1939. To further clarify that intent and to provide for its accomplishment, there is proposed a restatement of chapter 661 and certain amendments thereto with proposed changes which will provide the authority necessary to attain the desired objectives.

        If a suspended or dismissed unclassified employee alleges that he or she was discriminated against because of race, sex, age, physical handicap or political or religious beliefs, the employee is entitled to have that action reviewed by the personnel appeal board; however, it was the legislative intent that unclassified employees serve at the pleasure of their appointing authority absent an allegation of discrimination such that their suspension or dismissal cannot be construed as a “contested case” within the meaning of § 42-35-1.

     <p>
      The general assembly finds: that new trends in the use of alternative work schedules in the private sector have proven beneficial to employee and employer alike; that the congress of the United States has recently enacted and the president has signed legislation lending permanence to what had been heretofore an experimental program of alternative work schedules for federal employees; that it has been determined that alternative work schedules provide greater employment opportunities for women with young children; that the fastest growing segment of the work force is the “permanent part-time” work force; that alternative work schedules present greater job opportunity for the unemployed; that many of the fifty (50) states now offer alternative work schedules to their state employees and that the use of alternative work schedules result in improvement in service to the public, employee morale, and efficiency of agency operations. The general assembly therefore finds that there should be optional alternate working schedules available to state employees.

      It is the policy of the state to offer alternative working schedules to state employees, thereby enabling the appointing authority to allow for flexitime, compressed workweeks, job sharing, permanent part-time, and other alternative work plans, provided work schedule changes allow the maintaining of adequate work coverage and service to the public, in an effort to reduce commuter congestion, conserve energy, increase employee morale, increase productivity, and reduce tardiness and absenteeism. Any alternative work plans to insure compliance shall be jointly agreed to by the appointing authority and the certified bargaining representative.

     <p>
      Persons appointed to positions in the noncompetitive branch shall serve a probationary period of six (6) months during which time the appointing authority shall report to the personnel administrator every sixty (60) days concerning the work of the employee and at the end of the probationary period no further salary or other compensation shall be paid to the employee unless the appointing authority has filed with the personnel administrator a statement, in writing, that the services of the employee have been satisfactory and that it is desired that his or her services be continued. The probationary period is further defined to be one hundred-thirty (130) days worked in the non-competitive position to which the person has been appointed. Upon completion of the probationary period and receipt of the statement of satisfactory service by the personnel administrator and having fulfilled the requirements for character and physical condition, the employee shall be deemed to have acquired full status and shall enjoy all the rights and privileges of that status. Whenever a class of positions shall be assigned to the noncompetitive branch, every employee holding a position in that class at the time of assignment who is a temporary employee and has served in that class for six (6) months or more shall be considered to have completed the required probationary period and upon receipt of a statement from his or her appointing authority that his or her services have been satisfactory shall be deemed to have acquired full status and shall enjoy all the rights and privileges of that status. A temporary employee who has served at least four (4) months but has not completed six (6) months shall be deemed to have served four (4) months of the required probationary period and his or her appointing authority shall submit a report concerning the work of the employee to the personnel administrator and shall at the end of sixty (60) days submit a final probationary report for the employee. An employee who has served at least two (2) months but has not completed four (4) months shall be deemed to have served two (2) months of the required probationary period and his or her appointing authority shall submit a report concerning the work of the employee to the personnel administrator and shall subsequently submit a probationary report at the end of the next sixty (60) days and a final probationary report at the end of six (6) months of service.

        The court erred in vacating an arbitration reinstatement award, because the question of the justification of an employee’s termination for allegedly violating a personnel rule promulgated pursuant to subsection (a) was clearly an arbitrable grievance under an existing collective bargaining agreement, and on its face subsection (b) prohibits the rules from altering a union’s and the state’s collectively bargained agreement which relates to the unionized employees’ conditions of employment.

The complete classification plan shall be so arranged that all positions that are substantially similar with respect to authority, responsibility, and character of work are included within the same class and that the same pay schedules can be made to apply with equity under like working conditions. The class titles so established shall be used in all personnel, accounting, budget, appropriation, and financial records of all state departments, commissions, and institutions.

       It is the duty of the department of administration to maintain a pay plan for unclassified employees of the state, including any rules and regulations that are necessary to implement and complement the plan. In maintaining the pay plan, it will be the duty of the department of administration to allocate all new unclassified positions to existing grades within the plan, and to review at least once annually all existing unclassified positions and to reallocate those positions within the pay plan as it deems proper. No new unclassified position shall be created or allocated or reallocated to any grade within the plan unless state agency and department heads have been afforded the opportunity to make recommendations regarding the proposed changes; provided further, however that any unclassified position that has been vacant for more than twelve (12) months shall be canceled and removed from the unclassified pay plan unless within that twelve (12) months the person having supervisory authority over the position requests an extension, in which case the department of administration may approve an extension of not more than twelve (12) months; and provided further, that employees, appointing authorities, and the general public, shall be afforded an opportunity at a public hearing to provide testimony, orally and in writing, regarding the changes, prior to the department’s submission of recommendations to the governor. The agenda for the public hearing shall include a summary of the proposed changes. Hearings conducted pursuant to this section shall be subject to the provisions of chapter 46 of title 42.
      </li>
      <li id="t36c04s36-4-16.2ol1b">
       The department of administration, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, shall only have the authority to make recommendations to the governor. The governor shall approve and adopt the plan with such changes as he or she may deem necessary. Following approval by the governor, all unclassified pay plan changes shall be included in the normal budget process in the appropriate section of the personnel supplement.
      </li>
      <li id="t36c04s36-4-16.2ol1c">
       When the pay plan and regulations have been adopted they shall constitute the official pay schedule for the positions in the unclassified service. Thereafter, no person in the unclassified service shall be paid a salary that is greater than the maximum or less than the minimum rates fixed by the approved pay plan and regulations or by amendments thereto, nor shall salary adjustments for unclassified employees made by the department of administration during its review exceed two (2) grades per year at the maximum of the grade; provided, however, that unclassified employees shall be entitled to all monetary additives accorded other state employees, including, but not limited to, longevity and incentive training awards.

     <p>
      The competitive tests shall be designed to determine fairly the capacity of the persons examined to perform the duties of the positions in the classes for which the lists are prepared. The competitive tests shall be open to applicants who are residents of the state of Rhode Island; provided, that the personnel administrator may admit to competitive tests for technical, professional, or unusual positions residents of other states. Any resident denied admission to an examination on the grounds of insufficient qualifications as established in the class specifications involved may, within five (5) calendar days of the mailing of the notices, appeal in writing to the administrator of adjudication for a hearing or review of the denial. On the basis of the review or hearing, the administrator of adjudication may direct the personnel administrator to permit the appellant to take the examination. The tests may take into consideration elements of character, education, aptitude, experience, knowledge, skill, personality, physical fitness, professional license, or specialized training, and other pertinent matters, and may be written, oral, physical, or in the form of demonstration of skill, or any combination of these types. Public notice of every test shall be given in the manner prescribed by the personnel rules. Persons having a legitimate and proper interest in examination questions used in connection with any examination shall be freely allowed to inspect the questions, when all phases of the examination in which the questions were used have been completed under such conditions as shall be specified in the personnel rules. The final earned rating of each person competing in any test shall be determined by the weighted average of the earned rating on all phases of the test according to weights for each phase established by the personnel administrator in advance of the giving of the tests and published as part of the announcement of the examination. However, the personnel administrator may discontinue the examination process for any competitor when it has been determined that the required minimum final earned rating cannot be attained. All persons competing in any test shall be given written notice of their standing on any employment list or of their failure to attain a place upon the list. The personnel administrator may as deemed appropriate establish broadband examinations for a wide variety of entry and/or other levels of positions which would not be ranked in the traditional manner. The examinations would be ranked only upon certification to an appropriate vacancy and subject to conditions established in the personnel rules and the provisions of §§ 36-4-4 and 36-4-7 shall not apply to any appointments which are in the unclassified service. When an appropriate vacancy exists, the appointing authority will certify as to the appropriate knowledge, skills, and abilities required for successful performance in a particular position or positions. The personnel administrator will then proceed to rank all eligibles who have qualified and possess the requisite knowledge, skills, and abilities.

If, however, placement within the department or division is not possible, then the affected employee shall be placed in a comparable position elsewhere in state service. Whenever a position is allocated or reallocated upward, the classified employee with permanent status holding that position shall be given an opportunity to qualify for the allocated or reallocated position by taking a qualifying examination and shall be placed on leave of absence from the old position until the employee has gained status or failed to qualify for the position.

       To eliminate the overall adverse impact of systemic barriers to the employment of minorities as a protected class, the office of personnel administration shall provide all appointing authorities the necessary flexibility to remedy the effects of systemic discriminatory practices. Supplemental certification does not guarantee employment of protected classes. It guarantees the appointing authority increased opportunities, where possible, to appoint qualified employees from an expanded eligibility list whenever a department can demonstrate that there is statistical underrepresentation based on demographic analysis, otherwise called a “manifest imbalance” elsewhere in this chapter.

       Wherever a manifest imbalance exists, as substantiated by the appointing authority and certified by the equal opportunity administrator in conjunction with the state personnel administrator, a supplemental certification list of minorities may be called for in addition to the appropriate employment or promotion list, except in the following instances:

        This section, prior to the 1985 amendment, did not provide for automatic conversion to probationary status. The statute now specifically requires the appointing authority to act within 15 days of certification; if it fails to do so, then the eligible provisional employee will automatically become a probationary employee. If the appointing authority has another candidate for the position, or if it does not want to appoint the incumbent, then it must make another appointment within 15 days. Pilkington v.

      A classified employee with temporary status may be dismissed at the pleasure of an appointing authority under the provisions of § 36-4-31. A classified employee with provisional or probationary status may be dismissed for reasons relating to the employee’s qualifications or for the good of the service. A classified employee with permanent status may be dismissed by an appointing authority whenever he or she considers the good of the service to be served thereby, stated in writing, with full and sufficient reason, and filed with the personnel administrator. Any removal or separation of an employee from the classified service not otherwise provided for in this chapter shall be deemed to be a dismissal. In every case of dismissal, the appointing authority shall on or before the effective date thereof give written notice of this action and the reason therefor to the employee and shall file a copy of the notice with the personnel administrator not later than three (3) days after the effective date.

The employee who is returned to his or her office or position by the appeal board following a review or public hearing shall be granted by the state of Rhode Island counsel fees, payable to his or her representative counsel, of fifty dollars ($50.00) for each day his or her counsel is required to appear before the appeal board in the behalf of the aggrieved employee.

        If a suspended or dismissed unclassified employee alleges that he or she was discriminated against because of race, sex, age, physical handicap or political or religious beliefs, the employee is entitled to have that action reviewed by the personnel appeal board; however, it was the legislative intent that unclassified employees serve at the pleasure of their appointing authority absent an allegation of discrimination and their suspension or dismissal cannot be construed as a “contested case” within the meaning of § 42-35-1.

        Under this section as amended in 1955 and prior to the 1961 amendment, the board was only authorized to pass on the merits of the appeal and had no authority to determine the period of time to which petitioner was entitled to be reinstated; therefore, when this section was amended in 1961 subsequent to the appeal, but prior to the hearing, the board, which made a finding that petitioner was entitled to be reinstated, had no further power to provide that such reinstatement should terminate on the effective date of the 1961 amendment to this section.

        When he achieved full status in 1988, the employee obtained a property interest in his continued employment with the state agency such that he was unable to be terminated from state service except for cause or be “reorganized” into a different limited-term classification without paying him just compensation for taking his protected property interest in his full-status employment; when the state agency declined to reappoint the employee to a limited-term position in 1996 and refused to retain him as a classified full-status state employee, it violated the merit system, which prohibited it from dismissing the employee from state service without cause to do so.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Since a state official had no power to accede to the payment of overtime benefits via a method of computation that included paid sick-leave time being counted as hours worked, since both state law and the relevant collective bargaining agreement (CBA) had removed that from the bargaining table, neither he nor the human services agency had the power to modify the statutory obligations of the parties to the CBA and bind the state to a course of conduct that was illegal.

        An arbitrator exceeded his authority by deciding an issue involving a nondelegable-nonmodifiable-statutory mandate for the human services department to exclude paid sick-leave hours when computing whether its employees were entitled to overtime compensation during any given pay period.

       <p>
        The Superior Court correctly ruled that an arbitrator exceeded his authority by awarding overtime pay based on a computation which included sick-leave hours as hours worked, since such an award not only manifestly disregarded the applicable terms of the workers’ compensation statute, but also overrode those provisions in the parties’ own collective bargaining agreement that barred such a result.

       Findings:  Rhode Island is dedicated to environmental protection, efficient use of resources, sound fiscal policy, and sustainable development. Reducing vehicle miles traveled for commuting to work can lead to reductions in air pollution emissions, greenhouse gases, energy consumption, road congestion, and parking shortages. Reduced vehicle miles traveled would also lead to lower total motor fuel consumption, keeping more energy dollars that now flow out-of-state available in the state for local consumption and investment; a state government plan to reduce “drive alone” commuting and an increase in carpooling, transit use, and walk-to-work modes is required. State government, as a major employer can lead by example in promoting alternative forms of travel that can reduce vehicle miles traveled.
      </li>
      <li id="t36c06s36-6-21.1ol1b">
       The department of administration shall set up a committee on state employee transportation which shall consist of the directors of the department of administration, RIDOT, RIDEM, RIDOH and statewide planning, or their designees, the general manager of RIPTA or designee, and a representative from a state employee union, to develop, publicize, and implement a plan to give incentives to state employees to reduce vehicle miles in commuting to work. The committee will investigate employee incentives for reducing commuting vehicle miles offered by other public bodies around the country, investigate practices developed by the environmental protection agency’s “Best Workplaces for Commuters Program”, consider the implementation of carpool, telecommuting, guaranteed-ride-home, bike-to-work and walk-to-work programs, and incorporate or adopt those ideas deemed appropriate for Rhode Island into the plan. The plan shall include, but is not limited to, a means for determining base year values of the proportion of single occupant vehicle commute trips and the commute trip vehicle miles traveled per employee and progress toward meeting commute trip reduction plan goals on an annual basis. The goals of miles traveled per employee for all state agencies shall not be less than fifteen percent (15%) reduction from the base year value by January 1, 2012, twenty-five percent (25%) reduction from the base year values by January 1, 2014, and thirty-five percent (35%) reduction from the base year values by January 1, 2016. The plan will also include an offer of a RIPTA transit pass to employees in lieu of parking privileges.

      Beginning on July 1, 2011, notwithstanding any rule, regulation, or provision of the public laws or general laws to the contrary, there shall be no further longevity increases for officers, secretaries, and employees of the legislative branch, the judicial branch, the office of the governor, the office of the lieutenant governor, the department of state, the department of the attorney general, and the treasury department; provided, however, for employees with longevity provisions pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement in effect on June 1, 2011, longevity increases shall cease beginning on July 1, 2011 or beginning upon the expiration of the applicable collective bargaining agreement, whichever occurs later. To the extent an employee has previously accrued longevity payments, the employee shall continue to receive the same longevity percentage in effect on June 30, 2011, or in the case of an employee with longevity provisions pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement in effect on June 1, 2011, the same longevity percentage in effect on June 30, 2011 or upon the expiration of the applicable collective bargaining agreement, whichever occurs later.

      A retirement system is hereby established and placed under the management of the retirement board for the purpose of providing retirement allowances for employees of the state of Rhode Island under the provisions of chapters 8 — 10 of this title. The retirement system so created shall begin operation as of July 1, 1936. It shall have the power and privileges of a corporation and shall be known as the “employees’ retirement system of the state of Rhode Island”, and by that name all of its business shall be transacted, all of its funds invested, and all of its cash, securities, and other property held.

        Superior court properly granted a union’s motion to compel arbitration and denied a city’s motion to reopen the record because the municipal police officer, who had been denied accidental disability retirement, had not retired and therefore the union had standing to pursue a grievance on his behalf and the dispute was arbitrable. The retirement board lacked authority to unilaterally retire the officer, and a letter from the officer to the city did not effectuate his retirement where his offer of retirement was conditional and the city rejected the condition.

       Any state employee who shall have rendered service as a teacher as defined under the provisions of chapters 16 and 17 of title 16 shall be entitled to credit for that service for the various purposes of this system, provided the member shall have been a contributing member of this system for that period. Any state employee who shall have been a contributing member of the municipal system as defined under the provisions of chapter 21 of title 45 shall be given credit for that service for the various purposes of this system, provided the member’s contributions are transferred to this system. All contributions made by the member shall be transferred in toto to this system for the periods of service and the retirement system shall calculate the full actuarial value of the accrued benefit with the former employer. If the full actuarial value of the accrued benefit with the former employer is greater than the total employee contributions transferred, the retirement system shall also transfer the difference between the full actuarial value of the accrued benefit with the former employer and the employee’s contributions from the account of the former employer to the account of the current employer. In any case in which a member shall have received a refund or refunds of contributions made to the system, the allowance of the aforesaid credit for service shall be conditioned upon the payment of the full actuarial cost as defined in § 36-8-1(10). Any service as defined herein for which no contributions were made may be granted provided the member pays to the retirement system the full actuarial cost as defined in § 36-8-1(10). Any state employee or teacher as defined under the provisions of chapters 16 and 17 of title 16 who shall have been employed by a municipality that did not elect to accept chapter 21 of title 45 as provided in § 45-21-4 shall be given credit for that service for the various purposes of this system, provided that the employee shall have met the definitional requirements of “employee” as stated in § 45-21-2(7) and provided the member pays to the retirement system an amount equal to the full actuarial value of the credit as certified by the retirement board; provided, however, that any state employee who shall have been employed by a municipality that did not elect to accept chapter 21 of title 45 as provided in § 45-21-4 shall be given credit for that service for the various purposes of this system, to a maximum period of four (4) years, provided the member pays to the retirement system the full actuarial cost as defined in § 36-8-1(10). Nothing in this section shall be deemed to allow the purchase of four (4) years of service for credit in more than one retirement system.

For any member making this election, the member will receive a single benefit equal to the accrued benefit computed under § 36-10-10.2, plus the accrued benefit computed under § 36-10-10.

        Where the class of persons who were “evicted” were individuals who were never public employees, at least in the capacity for which the state pensions were sought, and were permitted to enter the system at bargain-basement prices while retaining their pensions as union employees, the choice to evict them, returning their contributions with interest, was not so patently arbitrary, irrational, or unrelated to a legitimate legislative purpose as to constitute a violation of substantive due process.

       The determination of the employer contribution rate commencing with fiscal year 2017 shall include a re-amortization of the current unfunded actuarial accrued liability (UAAL) attributable to the sixty percent (60%) of contribution responsibility not partitioned to the state in § 16-16-22 over a closed twenty-five (25) year period. This will be accomplished by dividing the UAAL as of June 30, 2014 into two (2) separate amortization periods.

      All contributions made by members and interest thereon to July 1, 1947, shall be credited to the individual members’ accounts in the annuity savings account. Effective July 1, 1947, the amount of accumulated contributions in the accounts of the members of the system which have been credited to the annuity savings fund shall be transferred to the annuity savings account and maintained in that account to the credit of the individual members. Effective July 1, 1965, the accumulated contributions of any inactive member who has been separated from service for five (5) years or more whose total service is less than ten (10) years shall be transferred from the annuity savings account to the contingent reserve for state employees or teacher members as the case may be. These funds will be held in escrow and should any member reenter service and again become a member, his or her previous contributions shall be revived and reinstated to his or her account for all purposes of this system. A member will still be eligible for a refund of these contributions upon application by him or her or his or her heirs at any time. Member contributions made pursuant to § 36-10-1.1 or 16-16-22.1 pursuant to a plan for the employer pick up of employee contributions shall be credited to a separate fund within an individual member’s account in the annuity savings account so that the amounts contributed prior to the effective date for the pick up of employee contributions may be distinguished from the amounts contributed on or after the date of which the governmental employer begins to pick up the employee contributions required by law.

     <p>
      A member who withdraws from service or ceases to be a member for any reason other than death or retirement shall be paid on demand a refund consisting of the accumulated contributions standing to his or her credit in his or her individual account, without interest. Any member receiving a refund shall thereby forfeit and relinquish all accrued rights as a member of the system together with credits for total service previously granted to the member; provided, however, that if any member who has received a refund shall subsequently reenter the service and again become a member of the system, he or she shall have the privilege of restoring all money previously received or disbursed to his or her credit as a refund of contributions, plus regular interest for the period from the date of refund to the date of the restoration. Upon the repayment of such refund including accrued interest as herein provided, the member shall again receive credit for the amount of total service which he or she had previously forfeited by the acceptance of the refund. The restoration of that credit shall be permitted only after the member shall have rendered at least one year of continuous service following his or her latest reentry into service for which he or she shall have made contributions to this system.

       Any member who has attained the age of fifty (50) years may be retired subsequent to the proper execution and filing of written application; provided, however, that the member shall have completed twenty-five (25) years of total service within the department of behavioral healthcare, developmental disabilities and hospitals and who retires before October 1, 2009, or is eligible to retire as of September 30, 2009.

       For members who become eligible to retire on or after October 1, 2009, benefits are available to members who have attained the age of fifty-five (55) and have completed at least twenty-five (25) years of total service within the department of behavioral healthcare, developmental disabilities and hospitals. For members in service as of October 1, 2009, who were not eligible to retire as of September 30, 2009, but who are eligible to retire on or prior to June 30, 2012, the minimum retirement age of fifty-five (55), the retirement age will be adjusted downward in proportion to the amount of service the member has earned as of September 30, 2009. The proportional formula shall work as follows:
       <ol>
        <li id="t36c10s36-10-9.3ol1c1">
         The formula shall determine the first age of retirement eligibility under the laws in effect on September 30, 2009, which shall then be subtracted from the minimum retirement age of fifty-five (55).

        <li id="t36c10s36-10-9.3ol1c2">
         The formula shall then take the member’s total service credit as of September 30, 2009, as the numerator and the years of service credit determined under (1) as the denominator.

        <li id="t36c10s36-10-9.3ol1c3">
         The fraction determined in (2) shall then be multiplied by the age difference determined in (1) to apply a reduction in years from age fifty-five (55).

        Complaint for declaratory relief from the denial of a claimant’s request for accidental disability benefits by the Retirement Board of the Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island was properly dismissed because the claimant’s application for accidental disability benefits was not timely filed under R.I. Gen. Laws § 36-10-14(b). The statute was unambiguous, and the court had no authority to expand it so that it could be tolled to save untimely claims. Iselin v. Ret. Bd. of the Emples. Ret. Sys.,

     <p>
      Once each year the retirement board may, and upon his or her application shall, require any disability beneficiary under the minimum age of service retirement to undergo a medical examination. The examination to be made at the place of residence of the beneficiary or other place mutually agreed upon by a physician or physicians engaged by the retirement board. If the examination indicates that the beneficiary is able to engage in a gainful occupation, his or her name shall be placed on such appropriate lists of candidates as are prepared for appointment to positions in his or her department or agency for which he or she is stated to be qualified and for a salary grade not exceeding that from which he or she was last retired. Should the beneficiary be engaged in a gainful occupation or should he or she be offered service as a result of the placing of his or her name on a list of candidates, the retirement board shall adjust and from time to time readjust, the amount of his or her disability benefit to an amount which shall not exceed the rate of benefit upon which he or she was originally retired, and which, when added to the amount then earnable by him or her, shall not exceed his or her rate of annual compensation currently for the classification that the disability annuitant held prior to retirement. Should any disability beneficiary under the minimum age of service retirement refuse to submit to one medical examination in any year by a physician or physicians designated by the retirement board, his or her benefit shall be discontinued until his or her withdrawal of the refusal and should his or her refusal continue for one year, all his or her rights in and to disability benefit shall be revoked by the retirement board. A disability beneficiary, reinstated to active service, shall be reinstated as a member and participate in the rights of the retirement system to the same extent as any other member.

      Proposed legislation which directly impacts the retirement system can potentially affect the benefits of all plan participants and beneficiaries. Since it is in the best interests of plan participants and beneficiaries to determine the financial consequences of any proposed legislation which would directly impact the state’s liability to the retirement system, such legislation shall not be approved by the general assembly unless an explanatory statement or note, prepared and paid for by the employees’ retirement system of the state of Rhode Island is appended to the proposed legislation which actuarially calculates, based upon approved retirement board assumptions, the projected twenty (20) year cost of the proposed legislation. These statements or notes shall be known as “pension impact notes,” and they shall accompany each such bill or resolution prior to consideration of the house in which the bill or resolution originated. The reasonable cost of preparing pension impact notes shall be charged as an administrative expense and paid from the retirement system’s restricted receipts account established pursuant to § 36-8-10.1. Only the chair of the senate committee on finance with the approval of the president of the senate can request a pension impact note on proposed legislation that originates in the senate. Only the chair of the house committee on finance with the approval of the speaker of the house can request a pension impact note on proposed legislation that originates in the house. The governor can request a pension impact note on proposed legislation recommended in the appropriation acts required by §§

        R.I. Gen. Laws § 36-10.1-4(c) provides that no payments in return of contributions shall be made or ordered unless and until the public official or public employee has satisfied in full certain judgments or orders, which is followed by four modifying phrases: (1) rendered by any court of competent jurisdiction; (2) for the payment of restitution; (3) for losses incurred by any person; and (4) as a result of the subject crime related to public office or public employment. After reading § 36-10.1-4(c) in its entirety, alongside the Rhode Island Public Employee Pension Revocation and Reduction Act’s, R.I. Gen. Laws tit. 36, ch. 10.1, other provisions, the state’s highest court concludes that the four phrases following the disjunctive phrase “judgments or orders” modify the phrase “judgments or orders.” Zambarano v.

        Superior court erred in ordering a wife to forward pension payments to her husband’s employer to satisfy his restitution obligations because the Public Employee Pension Revocation and Reduction Act, § 36-10.1-1 et seq., could not be used to punish the innocent spouse for the misdeeds of the husband; the final payee of the husband’s pension payments would be the employer, which did not qualify as an innocent spouse, dependent, or beneficiary.

        Retirement Board of the Employees’ Retirement System of the State of Rhode Island could not refuse a former employee’s demand under R.I. Gen. Laws § 36-10-8 for a return of his pension contributions under R.I. Gen. Laws § 36-10.1-4(c) since “for the payment of restitution” in § 36-10.1-4(c) modified both “judgments” and “orders” and an order of forfeiture entered in the employee’s federal bribery case was not an order of restitution since the federal court did not order the employee to restore the $ 46,000 that he and his co-defendants had accepted as bribe money to the individuals who had bribed the public officials, but ordered the employee to forfeit his ill-gotten gains to the federal government as part of his punishment.

        R.I. Gen.

After reading § 36-10.1-4(c) in its entirety, alongside the Rhode Island Public Employee Pension Revocation and Reduction Act’s, R.I. Gen.

        Superior court erred in declining to apply the husband’s pension contributions to his restitution obligations merely because he failed to make that specific request; the Public Employee Pension Revocation and Reduction Act, § 36-10.1-1 et seq., clearly vested the superior court with discretion to determine whether funds otherwise due to the public employee as a return of contribution be paid in satisfaction of the outstanding restitution.

        Amendments to R.I. Gen. Laws § 36-12-4 which reduced the state’s contribution to retired state employees’ health benefits did not violate the contracts clauses in R.I. Const. art. I, § 12 or U.S. Const. art. I, § 10 because the state and the state’s employees had no contract when the changes took effect, as (1) a prior collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the state and the employees had been validly terminated pursuant to the CBA’s terms, (2) any continuing employee rights did not exist by virtue of the CBA, and (3) the CBA did not vest health benefits in employees who had not retired.

       The director of the department of administration shall ensure retired employees access to Medicare-eligible retiree healthcare insurance. Under this program, the state will establish a health reimbursement account (HRA) funded by state contributions for each Medicare-eligible state retiree who elects to receive healthcare insurance through the state-sponsored program.
      </li>
      <li id="t36c12s36-12-4.1ol1b">
       The funds contained in the HRA may be utilized for any eligible medical care expenses as defined in § 213(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which includes reimbursements for healthcare insurance premiums.

       The maximum state contribution to each Medicare-eligible state retiree’s HRA account will be equal to the lowest-cost Medicare supplemental plan that is filed with the Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner of Rhode Island, that is available through the state-sponsored program, and that meets the provisions of the Medicare-eligible retiree healthcare insurance benefit defined in § 36-12-1(9). The maximum state contribution will vary by age as specified by the rates set forth in the Medicare supplemental plan filing.

       For Medicare-eligible state retirees who retired before September 30, 2008, effective January 1, 2014, the state of Rhode Island will credit an amount to each retiree’s HRA account on a monthly basis. The amount of such credit shall be calculated based on the retiree’s years of service, as a percentage of the maximum state contribution set forth in (d) above, and in accordance with the following formula:
       <p id="t36c12s36-12-4.1ol1e.1">

       Background.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The general assembly finds that the State faces a significant unfunded liability associated with its retiree health care benefits programs. To date, the State has been funding retiree health care benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis. Recently established governmental accounting standards applicable to the State require that the State account for such unfunded costs on an accrued actuarial basis. An actuarial study conducted by the State shows that the State faces an unfunded future liability for retiree health care benefits in excess of six hundred million dollars ($600,000,000). The creation and eventual funding of a dedicated trust fund for the purpose of financing this liability on accrued actuarial basis is fiscally prudent and will produce significant benefits to the State.

        In a declaratory judgment action brought by a town against a school committee, it was held on appeal that the school committee was prohibited from retaining independent counsel for its legal matters and was required to have the town solicitor handle its legal matters, with the town solicitor having the authority to decline representation if ethical considerations warranted. The appellate court also held that the school committee was a department of the town and, therefore, was required to abide by the town’s charter, which required all legal matters for any of the town’s departments, agencies, or offices to be handled by the town solicitor.

       <p>
        The revolving-door legislation of subsections (n) and (o) passes constitutional equal-protection muster, since the legislation is rationally related to a legitimate state interest in protecting the public by preventing public officials from taking advantage of their positions by securing employment in a related entity for one year. In re Advisory from the Governor,
        <cite class="ocri">

        (R.I. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        The presumption contained in the revolving-door legislation of subsections (n) and (o) is either rebuttable, temporary, or both. Consequently the revolving-door legislation does not violate due process because it does not contain an irrebuttable presumption. In re Advisory from the Governor,

       <p>
        Subsections (n) and (o) do not contain any language that vests the legislature with any appointment power. Consequently the legislature has not, directly or indirectly, assumed any essential power of the governor. Thus, subsections (n) and (o) do not violate the separation of powers doctrine.

        There is no language in the conflict-of-interest statute (now Code of Ethics) that limits violations to circumstances where a public official renders a decision that results in financial gain. Rather, § 36-14-6 (now § 36-14-7) provides that a conflict of interest exists if the public official “has reason to believe or expect that he [or she] . . . will derive a direct monetary gain . . . by reason of his [or her] official activity,” and the actions of members of a town council in passing a resolution asking the legislature to amend the town charter to give them an expense allowance constituted “official activity.” Celona v.
