        In a case involving an infringement upon a registered trademark, the court properly awarded an accounting of profits, even though the trademark owner did not give the notice of registration required under federal law, because, under Rhode Island law, registration of a mark is itself constructive notice of the registrant’s claim of ownership.

       “Gift certificate” means a record evidencing a promise, made for monetary consideration, by the seller or issuer for the record that goods or services will be provided to the owner of the record to the value shown in the record and includes, but is not limited to: (1) A record that contains a microprocessor chip, magnetic strip, or other means of storage of information that is pre-funded and for which the value is decremented upon each use; (2) A gift card, an electronic gift card, stored-value card or certificate; (3) A store card; (4) Prepaid long-distance telephone service that is activated by a prepaid card that requires dialing an access number or an access code for each call in addition to dialing the phone number to which the user of the prepaid card seeks to connect; or (5) A similar record or card. Any person, firm, or corporation that sells gift certificates for any product or merchandise sold by the person, firm, or corporation, shall be required to record the sales and keep an accurate and complete record of each gift certificate sold. The record shall include the date of sale; the full value of the certificate; the identification number assigned by the retailer to the certificate; and the state in which the sale of the certificate took place. The retailer shall further be required to give to the purchaser of gift certificates exceeding fifty dollars ($50.00) a written and numbered receipt evidencing the sale of the certificate. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation of any kind to charge any surcharge or additional monthly or annual service or maintenance fees on gift certificates or to limit the time for the redemption of a gift certificate or to place an expiration date upon the gift certificate. No gift certificate or any agreement with respect to such gift certificate may contain language suggesting that an expiration date may apply to the gift certificate. Any person, firm, or corporation that shall violate the provisions of this section shall be punished by a fine of not more than two hundred dollars ($200). Due to the unlimited redemption period, the division of taxation shall not escheat the funds paid for those unredeemed gift certificates. Any unused portion of a redeemed gift certificate shall be afforded to the consumer by reissuing the gift certificate for the unused amount or providing cash where the balance due the consumer is less than one dollar ($1.00).

      Any consumer who requests disclosure of his or her credit file from a credit bureau shall be entitled to have mailed to the consumer a copy of the information in the files of the credit bureau that pertains to the consumer at the time of the consumer’s request for disclosure within four (4) working days of the request. The credit bureau may impose a reasonable charge for the report, but that charge shall not exceed eight dollars ($8.00) per report. The maximum charge for the report may be raised annually not to exceed the increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The copy shall be furnished without charge if the request for a copy of the report is the result of a consumer being notified that adverse action has been taken on a credit application based on the credit report, provided the request for the report is made within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice.

       Price comparison advertising is a form of advertising commonly used in the sale or offering for sale of precious metals and stones whereby current prices are compared with former or future prices or other stated values to demonstrate price reductions or cost savings. While price comparisons accurately reflecting market values in the trade area provide consumers with useful information in making value comparisons and market buying decisions, price comparisons based on arbitrary or inflated prices or values can only serve to deceive or mislead. Further abuse occurs when sellers fail to disclose material information essential to consumer understanding of the comparisons made.
      </li>
      <li id="t06c13.2s6-13.2-1ol1b">
       The use of arbitrary or inflated price comparisons in violation of this rule as an inducement to the sale of precious metals and stones is injurious to both the consuming public and competitors, and is an unfair trade practice and unfair method of competition.

      The following words as used in this chapter, unless a different meaning is required by the context or is specifically prescribed, shall have the following meanings:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t06c13.2s6-13.2-2ol11">
       “Advertisement” means any oral, written, or graphic statement or representation made in connection with the solicitation of business in any manner for the purpose of soliciting a consumer in this state by a seller and includes, without limitation because of enumeration, statements and representations, but does not include price tags or in-store signs, or printed in any sales literature or brochure excepting catalogs. The terms “producer”, “manufacturer”, “wholesaler”, “importer”, or words of similar meaning, mean sellers engaged in resales, not sellers of products or services for consumer, personal, family, or household use or consumption. No price comparison may be made by a seller for precious metal and stones at wholesale, wholesale prices, factory prices, or the like. If the prices for the sale being offered are the net-cost prices retailers usually and customarily pay when they buy that merchandise for resale, sales may be termed net-cost sales and in that event sellers may advertise cost prices providing the substantiation of net-cost prices that are maintained for six (6) months. In no event may retailers, in their departments that sell precious metals or stones, hold themselves or their sale out as wholesalers or as wholesale prices or otherwise;
      </li>
      <li id="t06c13.2s6-13.2-2ol12">
       “Consumer property” means precious metals and stones sold primarily for personal, family, gift, or household use and not for resale or for use or consumption in a trade or business. For purposes of this chapter, “consumer property” includes “merchandise”;
      </li>
      <li id="t06c13.2s6-13.2-2ol13">
       “Date”, as applied to “date on which a price comparison is stated in the advertisement” in newspapers or other printed publications, means either the date of publication or distribution or the date on which the completed advertising copy is submitted to the printer for final printing and publication, provided the submission date does not exceed thirty (30) days from the date of actual publication or distribution;
      </li>
      <li id="t06c13.2s6-13.2-2ol14">
       “Precious metal” means metals that are prized because of chemical and physical properties (notably resistant to corrosion, hardness, strength, and beauty) desirable in jewelry, coinage, and objects of art, and that are at the same time relatively rare or inexpensive. Gold, silver, and the six (6) metals of the platinum group are usually considered precious metals;
      </li>
      <li id="t06c13.2s6-13.2-2ol15">
       “Precious stones” means one of the three (3) traditional categories of natural gemstones, the most valuable, as distinguished from semi-precious and decorative. Diamond, ruby, emerald, sapphire and pearl have long been considered “precious,” but, in accordance with their spiraling prices, alexandrite, black opal, cat’s eye, demantoid, and jadeite are included in this category;
      </li>
      <li id="t06c13.2s6-13.2-2ol16">
       “Price comparison” means the comparison, whether or not expressed wholly or in part in dollars, cents, fractions or percentages, in an advertisement of a seller’s current price for consumer property or services with any other price or statement of value for consumer property, whether or not these prices are actually stated in the advertisement; or, the making of price reductions claims or savings claims with respect to the seller’s current price. The term includes, but shall not be limited to, such comparisons as “fifty percent off ”; “up to seventy percent off ”; “save one-third”; “half-price” sale; “thirty percent to seventy percent off ”; “was twenty dollars, now half price”; “ten-dollar value, now eight dollars”; “was seven dollars now six dollars”; “list price fifty dollars our price twenty-nine dollars”; “clearance price”; or “liquidation price”;
      </li>
      <li id="t06c13.2s6-13.2-2ol17">
       “Sale” means a reduction from the seller’s price at which consumer property is offered to the public for a fixed period of time; and
      </li>
      <li id="t06c13.2s6-13.2-2ol18">
       “Seller” means a person engaged in the sale of consumer property and includes individuals, corporations, partnerships, associations, and any other form of business organization or entity. The term shall not include banks, savings and loan associations, insurance companies, and public utilities.

        Even though a trial justice in a bench trial misinterpreted R.I. Gen. Laws § 6-14-9 by failing to acknowledge that goods purchased outside the 30-day period prior to applying for a going out of business (GOB) permit could be evidence of a violation of the statute, the error was harmless because the plaintiff did not submit evidence of the GOB company’s stock prior to and during the GOB sale. A judgment against plaintiff on its claim under the statute was proper. V. George Rustigian Rugs, Inc. v. Renaissance Gallery, Inc.,

        An assignment for the benefit of creditors is not void under this section if it attempts to appropriate assigned property to pay creditors who have released their claims without payment under a prior assignment, although the court will direct that nothing be paid from the assigned funds to the released creditors. Nightingale v. Harris &amp; Lippitt,

        The statute is not violated by an assignment for the benefit of creditors merely because the instrument does not purport to assign all of the debtor’s property if, in fact, the assignment does convey all of his property. Nightingale v. Harris &amp; Lippitt,

        Assignment for benefit of creditors which showed on its face that it was for the benefit of the assignors in preventing the sacrifice of their property while tending to hinder and defraud creditors, and giving the assignees the power to carry on the business as long as they deemed advisable, was prima facie fraudulent and void.

        Where creditor by original writ attached property fraudulently conveyed by debtor, obtained judgment and levied on such property, which was sold and conveyed to creditor, creditor acquired an interest at the time of the attachment which ripened into title at the time of delivery of the sheriff’s deed to him, so that his title was unaffected by the fact that debtor was adjudged a bankrupt more than ten months after delivery of the deed, where such bankruptcy proceedings were not begun within four months after the attachment.

        Where creditor’s complaint did not allege any misrepresentations by a Chapter 13 debtor, but rather alleged as grounds for nondischargeability the debtor’s actual fraud based upon her violation of the Rhode Island Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, this was not sufficient to survive debtor’s motion to dismiss because actual fraud under the Bankruptcy Code nondischargeability provision carried the elements of fraudulent misrepresentation found in common law and, in the First Circuit, a misrepresentation by the debtor to the creditor was an essential element for establishing nondischarge of debt.

        Even if the defendant had delivered certain treasury checks to his mother on the condition that she return the funds if he needed them in the future, the transaction was still a “transfer” within the meaning of subsection (l ); to construe the statute as the defendant urged would allow debtors to place their assets beyond the reach of creditors simply by conditionally transferring them to relatives, which would undermine the statute’s very purposes and render it ineffectual.

        Trial court erred in refusing to vacate summary judgment in favor of defendants on plaintiff’s claim for breach of fiduciary duty, based on newly discovered evidence, as that evidence made it clear that defendants, a corporation and its principle, violated their fiduciary duty by making fraudulent transfers of an affiliate’s assets and preferential payments to its creditors in a transparent effort to avoid a judgment obtained by plaintiff.

        Evidence did not support the contention that a conveyance was made with actual intent to defraud where: (1) it was agreed that the transferee would buy the property at issue by making payments over a period of time when the property was purchased; (2) the taxpayer and her husband had legitimate reasons for conveying the property to the transferee; (3) the conveyance did not leave the taxpayer and her husband insolvent; and (4) there was no evidence that they had other debts or that the value of the property they still owned was less than their potential tax liability; although it was clear that the transfer was made without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange, the government failed to sustain its burden of showing that the remaining assets were insufficient to satisfy the transferors’ obligations.

        Evidence supported the contention that a conveyance to the transferors’ son, where the transfer was made after the couple’s tax liability had been established, and after their financial condition had deteriorated and the couple continued to live in the home and pay property taxes after the transfer, suggesting that the conveyance to the son was intended to place the property beyond the reach of the Internal Revenue Service; even if the transfer was not made with actual intent to defraud, it clearly ran afoul of R.I. Gen. Laws § 6-16-4(a)(2)(ii) because it was made when the couple was insolvent. United States v. Verduchi,

        Where debtors sold their real estate and paid off some, but not all of their unsecured debt, then transferred the remaining proceeds to their three children and to the debtor husband’s former wife over a 22-day period without receiving reasonably equivalent value for the transfers, a Chapter 7 trustee satisfied her burden under R.I.

        Conveyance in which the transferor’s last name was missing from the acknowledgment (although it appeared elsewhere in the document) and the words “free act and deed” were not included was nonetheless effective upon registration to put a good faith purchaser on notice of the transaction; therefore, the four-year statute of limitations for an effort to have the conveyance set aside as a fraudulent conveyance began to run at that point, and summary judgment was properly entered in favor of the transferee, on timeliness grounds, when such an action was commenced five years after the conveyance.

        This section’s remedial provisions are triggered only by the occurrence of an actual transfer, not by the future possibility of one, unless the plaintiff can prove that a fraudulent transfer is imminent. Thus, where a plaintiff sought the issuance of a temporary restraining order to prevent a fraudulent transfer but the plaintiff had no evidence that the defendant planned to transfer or in any way secrete with property in order to defraud plaintiff, the superior court properly denied his motion for prejudgment interest.

        While the mere filing of a deed alone might not have been enough to alert the plaintiff to an allegedly fraudulent transfer, where the plaintiff had known the address of the defendants’ residence since the time the original summons was served,
        nothing from that point on suggested a course of improper conduct designed to conceal the status of the defendants’ residence from the plaintiff, and the plaintiff had been alerted at least twice that the defendants were contemplating filing for bankruptcy, the trial justice properly held that the four-year statute of limitations barred the plaintiff’s claim and that the discovery exception was inapplicable.

        Conveyance in which the transferor’s last name was missing from the acknowledgment (although it appeared elsewhere in the document) and the words “free act and deed” were not included was nonetheless effective upon registration to put a good faith purchaser on notice of the transaction; therefore, the four-year statute of limitations for an effort to have the conveyance set aside as a fraudulent conveyance began to run at that point, and summary judgment was properly entered in favor of the transferee, on timeliness grounds, when such an action was commenced five years after the conveyance.

        Where a debtor had no equity in real property at the time the debtor transferred the property for no consideration to avoid claims of creditors, and thus the property was not an asset subject to attachment under the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, a creditor was not precluded from enforcing its judgment lien against the debtor’s retained equitable interest in the property through a common law resulting trust.

        Because the case involved purportedly usurious loans, which Rhode Island had a strong policy against, a determination that the loans were not usurious under Massachusetts law would be contrary to a fundamental public policy of Rhode Island; there was a stark difference between the usury laws of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, with Rhode Island providing much greater protection to borrowers (and to lenders) than Massachusetts, and therefore Rhode Island law governed the loans.

        Lenders failed to demonstrate that the required analyses were “obtained” by the borrowers, and the exception contained in subsection (e) did not apply because lenders failed to show that receiverships first obtained the required pro forma methods analyses prior to charging interest rates in excess of 21% per annum.

        Release and waiver of claims provision contained in the forbearance agreement did not fall within the narrow category of cases that permitted a debtor’s release of a usury claim because the nature of the execution of the agreement was highly coercive in light of the pressing financial needs of the receiverships and borrowers; there was no evidence the receiverships and the borrowers entered into the forbearance agreement for the purpose of avoiding or settling litigation.

        Trial court did not err by failing to find that the pre-2000 debt remained due and payable because there was no indication that the refinanced loans were simply amendments to the loans that formed the basis of the pre-2000 debt; the refinanced loans carried higher interest rates than the previous loans, established different terms of repayment, and did not reflect that any prior obligations of the borrowers were preserved, and the refinanced loans extinguished the pre-2000 loans.

        Subsection (c) contains no ambiguity and therefore the Supreme Court applies the language of the statute in accordance with its plain and ordinary meaning; the language of subsection (c) plainly shows that the Legislature assigned the right to recover disgorgement payments to those borrower(s) who made payments.
        Commerce Park Realty, LLC v. HR2-A Corp.,
        <cite class="ocri">
         253 A.3d 868

        </cite>
        (R.I. 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (c) postulates two threshold requirements for a party to be entitled to disgorgement payments: (1) the party must be a named “borrower” on the usurious loan, and (2) that named borrower must make any payment to the lender, irrespective of whether value is rendered directly or indirectly; if both of these conditions are met, the borrower is entitled to recover from the lender the amount so paid. Commerce Park Realty, LLC v. HR2-A Corp.,
        <cite class="ocri">
         253 A.3d 868
        </cite>

        <cite class="ocri">
         2021 R.I. LEXIS 85
        </cite>
        (R.I. 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because there was no evidence in the record of a payment made by borrowers in accordance with subsection (c), a factual predicate, there was no “amount so paid” for them to recover, and thus the trial court properly granted lenders summary judgment on the borrowers’ disgorgement claims; the borrowers could not receive reimbursement for payments that were never made, nor would they and the receiverships be accorded equal treatment when only the receiverships made usurious payments to the lenders.
        Commerce Park Realty, LLC v. HR2-A Corp.,
        <cite class="ocri">
         253 A.3d 868

        </cite>
        (R.I. 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the trial justice properly determined that borrowers did not meet the requirements set forth in subsection (c) to recover disgorgement payments, it properly dismissed the borrowers’ claims for punitive damages, as those claims failed as a matter of law; an award of punitive damages is in addition to an award of compensatory damages, and thus the trial justice properly determined that punitive damages had to be supported by an award of compensatory damages.

        An interest rate not usurious if the loan runs to maturity does not become so upon the debtor’s exercise of a prepayment option by reason of the fact that the rebate of interest computed on the Rule of 78’s method causes the interest paid to exceed the legal rate.

        Where money borrowed was used to pay off a previous loan owed to a different party, the amount of discount that the borrower received in paying off the previous loan could not be credited to the lender as a deduction from the amount of interest the borrower paid on the second loan so as to reduce the interest from a usurious rate to a legal rate.

        Superior court properly found that a loan was usurious and void because a fee contained in the loan agreement was not a commercial loan commitment fee since it did not assure the availability of a specified amount of credit for a specified time; the fee was a part of the interest being charged on the loan, and it substantially exceeded the 21 percent interest allowed.

Without limiting the foregoing, the amendment may change terms by the addition of new terms or by the deletion or modification of existing terms, whether relating to plan benefits or features; the rate or rates of interest; the manner of calculating interest or outstanding unpaid indebtedness; variable schedules or formulas; interest fees and charges; fees; collateral requirements; methods for obtaining or repaying extensions of credit; attorneys’ fees; plan termination; the manner for amending the terms of the agreement; arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution mechanisms; or other matters of any kind whatsoever.

An agreement governing a credit card plan may be amended pursuant to this section regardless of whether the plan is active or inactive or whether additional borrowings are available under it.

     <p>
      The general assembly finds that economic stabilization would be enhanced and that competition among the various financial institutions and other firms engaged in the extension of consumer credit would be strengthened by the informed use of credit. The informed use of credit results from an awareness of the cost of credit by consumers. It is the purpose of this chapter to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him or her and thus avoid the uninformed use of credit.

       No creditor shall impose a finance charge in excess of an amount equal to eighteen percent (18%) simple interest per annum. This subsection shall not apply to any transaction in connection with which the finance charge does not exceed ten dollars ($10.00). Notwithstanding the provision of any retail installment contract to the contrary, a buyer may prepay in full the unpaid balance of any retail installment contract at any time before its final due date and, if the buyer does so, shall receive a refund credit on the retail installment contract for the prepayment. The amount of the refund credit of finance charges on precomputed loans, made for an original term of sixty (60) months or less, may be calculated on the method commonly referred to as the rule of 78s or sum of the digits. Refund credits of finance charges on precomputed loans, made for an original term greater than sixty (60) months, must be at least the amount as that produced by the rule of anticipation.

       Notwithstanding any contrary provision of law, the maximum finance charge that may be applied under a revolving or open-end credit plan in connection with a transaction arising out of a retail sale of consumer goods, including the retail sale of gasoline or services, shall not exceed the rate or rates agreed to by the creditor and a retail buyer compared on the average daily balance of the open-end or revolving account or the unpaid balance of the open-end or revolving account outstanding as of the end of the current billing cycle. Regardless of any agreement to the contrary, a transaction under a revolving or open-end credit plan is subject to this section whenever a solicitation for the extension of credit is made by a creditor whose primary activity in Rhode Island is soliciting Rhode Island customers through the mails and the solicitation originates outside Rhode Island but is directed to, and received by, a retail buyer who resides and responds to the solicitation in Rhode Island.

        When a general contractor is sued by an employee of the subcontractor under circumstances covered by the Rhode Island Workers’ Compensation Act, the general contractor can obtain indemnification from a negligent subcontractor only if the contract so provides. In the absence of such a contract, the subcontractor is immune, pursuant to the Workers’ Compensation Act, from tortfeasor liability and from the obligation of contribution. Cosimini v.

        Trial court properly confirmed an arbitration award in favor of a property owner because the arbitrator’s decision drew its essence from the contract between the contractor and the subcontractor and was sufficiently grounded in the contract to be within the scope of his authority; although the arbitrator’s reliance on the indemnity clause could have been erroneous, the arbitrator’s interpretation of the agreement was plausible and rational and did not manifestly disregard the law.

        Where a subcontractor’s employee sues the general contractor after receiving workers’ compensation benefits from the subcontractor, and the jury apportions fault between the contractors, the general contractor is entitled to judgment on its cross-claim against the subcontractor, pursuant to an indemnity agreement signed by the subcontractor.

        Trial court erred in denying the general contractor’s post-verdict motion in the general contractor’s third-party action against the subcontractor arising out of the death of the subcontractor’s employee due to his fall on a school construction project; while it was true that the general contractor could not recover under an indemnification agreement where its own negligence caused the harm, once the jury determined that the general contractor was not negligent with respect to the employee’s death, the subcontractor had to indemnify the general contractor for the wrongful death settlement the general contractor entered into with the decedent’s estate, as the broad wording of the indemnification agreement that the subcontractor would indemnify the general contractor for any and all claims dictated that result.

        It was not necessary for the high court to decide whether an indemnification agreement that required subcontractor to indemnify the general contractor for liability for injuries to the subcontractor’s employee that were caused by the general contractor’s negligence, because there was no evidence the subcontractor had ever entered into an indemnification agreement with the general contractor; therefore, the court properly declared that the subcontractor’s liability insurer had no obligation to indemnify the general contractor.

If a person refuses to testify after being granted immunity from prosecution and after being ordered to testify as previously stated, he or she may be adjudged in civil contempt by the superior court until the time that he or she purges him or herself of contempt by testifying; producing documentary material; or presenting written answers as ordered. The foregoing shall not prevent the attorney general from instituting other appropriate contempt proceedings against any person who violates any of the above provisions.

        Definition of “misappropriation” under R.I. Gen. Laws § 6-41-1(2) of the Rhode Island Trade Secrets Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 6-41-1- et seq., included disclosure of a trade secret by one who acquired it while under a duty to maintain its secrecy and the acquisition of a trade secret by one who knew that it was acquired by breach of a duty to maintain secrecy; contrary to defendant competitor and former employee’s assertion, plaintiff former employer did not need to show that either the former employee or the competitor “used” plaintiff’s trade secrets. Disclosure or acquisition was sufficient to constitute misappropriation, subjecting defendants to liability for actual loss and unjust enrichment caused by the misappropriation pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 6-41-3(a). Astro-Med, Inc. v. Nihon Kohden Am., Inc.,

       Except to the extent that a material and prejudicial change of position prior to acquiring knowledge or reason to know of misappropriation renders a monetary recovery inequitable, a complainant is entitled to recover damages for misappropriation. Damages can include both the actual loss caused by misappropriation and the unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation that is not taken into account in computing actual loss. In lieu of damages measured by any other methods, the damages caused by misappropriation may be measured by imposition of liability for a reasonable royalty for a misappropriator’s unauthorized disclosure or use of a trade secret.

        Applying Rhode Island choice of law principles in a diversity case, with no choice of law provision in a non-compete agreement, Rhode Island law applied under the interest weighing test and as the place of contract. While Connecticut had a relationship to the case because of the employee’s customer base, it did not have the most significant interest, outweighing Rhode Island; the employer could maintain, then, its Rhode Island trade secret claim pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 6-41-1 et seq., but its unfair practices claim under Conn. Gen. Stat. § 42-110a et seq. was dismissed. R.J. Carbone Co. v. Regan,

        Definition of “misappropriation” under R.I. Gen. Laws § 6-41-1(2) of the Rhode Island Trade Secrets Act, R.I. Gen. Laws § 6-41-1- et seq., included disclosure of a trade secret by one who acquired it while under a duty to maintain its secrecy and the acquisition of a trade secret by one who knew that it was acquired by breach of a duty to maintain secrecy; contrary to defendant competitor and former employee’s assertion, plaintiff former employer did not need to show shown that either the former employee or the competitor “used” plaintiff’s trade secrets. Disclosure or acquisition was sufficient to constitute misappropriation, subjecting defendants to liability for actual loss and unjust enrichment caused by the misappropriation pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 6-41-3(a). Astro-Med, Inc. v. Nihon Kohden Am., Inc.,

        Corporation introduced evidence that the company and the employee misappropriated the corporation’s confidential customer lists and information about those customers, such as pricing strategies, which aided the company and the employee in making sales to those customers, and the corporation also provided evidence that industry gross profit margins ranged from 35-60 percent and taking the low end of that range, 35 percent, from the putative total sales loss of $ 1,008,921 made a profit loss of $ 353,122. In concurrence with the jury’s finding, the court found that the misappropriation was unquestionably willful and malicious, and therefore, the maximum exemplary damages award was appropriate to deter and punish such behavior and the corporation was awarded $ 560,000 in exemplary damages under the Rhode Island Trade Secrets Act, R.I.

        Court awarded reasonable attorney’s fees in the amount of $209,911.85 to the corproation under R.I. Gen. Laws § 6-41-4(c) because the jury’s finding of willful and malicious misappropriation of trade secrets was supported by substantial evidence and although the attorney’s fees were higher than in similar cases of the same nature, much of the additional costs could have been attributed to the company and the employee’s needless complication of the issues.

     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t06c41.1s6-41.1-1ol1a">
       Rhode Island is striving to build an entrepreneurial- and knowledge-based economy. Attracting and nurturing internet technology (“IT”) and other knowledge-based companies is an important part of this effort and will be beneficial to Rhode Island’s future.
      </li>
      <li id="t06c41.1s6-41.1-1ol1b">
       Patents are essential to encouraging innovation, especially in the IT- and knowledge-based fields. The protections afforded by the federal patent system create an incentive to invest in research and innovation, which spurs economic growth. Patent holders have every right to enforce their patents when they are infringed, and patent enforcement litigation is necessary to protect intellectual property.
      </li>
      <li id="t06c41.1s6-41.1-1ol1c">
       The general assembly does not wish to interfere with the good-faith enforcement of patents or good-faith patent litigation. The general assembly also recognizes that Rhode Island is preempted from passing any law that conflicts with federal patent law.
      </li>
      <li id="t06c41.1s6-41.1-1ol1d">
       Patent litigation can be technical, complex, and expensive. The expense of patent litigation, which may cost hundreds of thousands of dollars or more, can be a significant burden on small- and medium-size companies. Rhode Island wishes to help its businesses avoid these costs by encouraging the most efficient resolution of patent-infringement claims without conflicting with federal law.
      </li>
      <li id="t06c41.1s6-41.1-1ol1e">
       In order for Rhode Island companies to be able to respond promptly and efficiently to patent infringement assertions against them, it is necessary that they receive specific information regarding how their product, service, or technology may have infringed the patent at issue. Receiving such information at an early stage will facilitate the resolution of claims and lessen the burden of potential litigation on Rhode Island companies.
      </li>
      <li id="t06c41.1s6-41.1-1ol1f">
       Abusive patent litigation, and especially the assertion of bad-faith infringement claims, can harm Rhode Island companies. A business that receives a letter asserting such claims faces the threat of expensive and protracted litigation and may feel that it has no choice but to settle and to pay a licensing fee, even if the claim is meritless. This is especially so for companies and nonprofits that lack the resources to investigate and defend themselves against infringement claims.
      </li>
      <li id="t06c41.1s6-41.1-1ol1g">
       Not only do bad-faith patent infringement claims impose a significant burden on individual Rhode Island businesses, these claims also undermine Rhode Island’s efforts to attract and nurture other knowledge-based companies. Funds used to avoid the threat of bad-faith litigation are no longer available to invest, produce new products, expand, or hire new workers, thereby harming Rhode Island’s economy.
      </li>
      <li id="t06c41.1s6-41.1-1ol1h">
       Through this narrowly focused act, the general assembly seeks to facilitate the efficient and prompt resolution of patent-infringement claims; protect Rhode Island businesses from abusive and bad-faith assertions of patent infringement; and build Rhode Island’s economy, while at the same time respecting federal law and being careful to not interfere with legitimate patent-enforcement actions.

     </p>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t06c48s6-48-3ol1a">
       Identity theft is a growing menace for consumers in the new economy, as vast quantities of sensitive, personal information has become vulnerable to criminal interception and misuse;

       Identity theft has become a major law enforcement challenge;
      </li>
      <li id="t06c48s6-48-3ol1c">
       An integral part of many identity thefts involves the interception of personal financial data, the fraudulent acquisition of credit cards or other financial products in another person’s name;
      </li>
      <li id="t06c48s6-48-3ol1d">
       Identity theft is an act that violates the privacy of our citizens, ruins their good names and may subject them to restricted access to credit, diminished employment opportunities, and months or years of effort to repair damage to credit histories;
      </li>
      <li id="t06c48s6-48-3ol1e">
       Social security numbers are frequently used as identification numbers in many computer files, giving access to information an individual may want kept private, making it [is] wise to limit access to an individual’s social security number whenever possible; and
      </li>

       It is therefore a valid public purpose for the Rhode Island general assembly to ensure that the private financial information and social security numbers of the citizens of the state of Rhode Island are less accessible, in order to mitigate the potential for more identity theft to occur.

       Notice of rights.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any time that a consumer is required to receive a summary of rights required under section 609 of the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, (
      <cite class="ocri">
       15 U.S.C.
      </cite>
      § 1681 et. seq.) the following notice shall be included:
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumers have the right to obtain a security freeze
     </p>
     <p>
      You may obtain a security freeze on your credit report to protect your privacy and ensure that credit is not granted in your name without your knowledge. You have a right to place a “security freeze” on your credit report pursuant to chapter 48 of title 6 of the Identity Theft Prevention Act of 2006.
     </p>
     <p>
      The security freeze will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing any information in your credit report without your express authorization or approval.
     </p>
     <p>
      The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. When you place a security freeze on your credit report, within five (5) business days you will be provided a personal identification number or password to use if you choose to remove the freeze on your credit report or to temporarily authorize the release of your credit report for a specific period of time after the freeze is in place. To provide that authorization, you must contact the consumer reporting agency and provide all of the following:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t06c48s6-48-6ol11">
       The unique personal identification number or password provided by the consumer reporting agency.
      </li>
      <li id="t06c48s6-48-6ol12">
       Proper identification to verify your identity.
      </li>
      <li id="t06c48s6-48-6ol13">
       The proper information regarding the period of time for which the report shall be available to users of the credit report.
       <p id="t06c48s6-48-6ol13.1">
        A consumer reporting agency that receives a request from a consumer to temporarily lift a freeze on a credit report shall comply with the request no later than three (3) business days after receiving the request.
       </p>
       <p id="t06c48s6-48-6ol13.2">
        A security freeze does not apply to circumstances where you have an existing account relationship and a copy of your report is requested by your existing creditor or its agents or affiliates for certain types of an account review, collection, fraud control, or similar activities.
       </p>
       <p id="t06c48s6-48-6ol13.3">
        If you are actively seeking a new credit, loan, utility, telephone, or insurance account, you should understand that the procedures involved in lifting a security freeze may slow your own applications for credit. You should plan ahead and lift a freeze — either completely, if you are shopping around, or specifically for a certain creditor — with enough advance notice before you apply for new credit for the lifting to take effect.
       </p>
       <p id="t06c48s6-48-6ol13.4">
        You have a right to bring a civil action against someone who violates your rights under the credit reporting laws. The action can be brought against a consumer reporting agency or a user of your credit report.
       </p>
       <p id="t06c48s6-48-6ol13.5">
        Unless you are sixty-five (65) years of age or older, or you are a victim of identity theft with an incident report or complaint from a law enforcement agency, a consumer reporting agency has the right to charge you up to ten dollars ($10.00) to place a freeze on your credit report; up to ten dollars ($10.00) to temporarily lift a freeze on your credit report, depending on the circumstances; and up to ten dollars ($10.00) to remove a freeze from your credit report. If you are sixty-five (65) years of age or older or are a victim of identity theft with a valid incident report or complaint, you may not be charged a fee by a consumer reporting agency for placing, temporarily lifting, or removing a freeze.

        Auto parts dealer’s claim that a corporation’s contract termination violated the Rhode Island Fair Dealership Act (FDA) was dismissed as the corporation gave notice before the FDA’s effective date and R.I.

Laws §§ 6-50-3 and 6-50-4, revealed little implied intent for retroactivity; despite the FDA’s articulated remedial purpose, it was not a remedial statute as the obligations created and rights defined by § 6-50-4 rendered it a substantive act.

Within the fifteen-day (15) period, the chief of police, or his or her designee, shall designate in writing, an officer to secure the property alleged to be stolen and the persons in possession of the property shall deliver the property to the officer upon display of the officer’s written designation by the chief of police or his or her designee. Upon receipt of the property from the officer, the clerk or person in charge of the storage of alleged stolen property for a police department shall enter into a book a description of every article of property alleged to be stolen that was brought to the police department and shall attach a number to each article.
